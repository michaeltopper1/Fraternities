# Background

Fraternities are a widespread tradition in the US.

## Benefits of Fraternities:
  - Community service, volunteering, graduation rates, and future income.
  
## Downsides of Fraternity Membership:
  - Risky Behavior
  - Binge drinking and college partying

Recently, campus administrators began to use temporary campus-wide bans of fraternity social events with alcohol (moratoriums) to change behavior.

**Question**: How do these moratoriums affect alcohol offenses and sexual assaults?

---

# Moratoriums

## Moratorium Definition:

A temporary *campus-wide* halt on fraternity social events with alcohol.
  - Applies to IFC fraternities (e.g., social fraternities)
  - Popularized in the mid-2010s.

## Sources of Enforcement:
  - University Administration
  - IFC Council (student-enforced)

# How might a moratorium affect behavior?
.pull-left[
### Moratoriums may be beneficial:
* Fraternities are source of alcohol for underage drinking ()
  * College partying leads to more rape and alcohol (Lindo)
  * Restricting alcohol harsher leads to less drinking (Lin)
  * Alcohol has shown to increase mortality, poor academics, and crime.

]

.pull-right[
### Moratoriums may be detrimental:
* Displacement of crime
  * May cause large increases after moratorium is over - net effect could be worse
  * Partying in riskier places

# Research Question

### Question: 
* How do fraternity moratoriums affect campus-wide police reports of alcohol offenses and sexual assault?

### Novel Data: 
* Constructed from Daily Crime Logs from university-specific police departments (2014-2019).

### Identification: 
* Exploit the variation in timing of the moratoriums using a difference-in-differences design.

# Contribution
* First study to evaluate moratoriums. (Go into why this is the first)
* Novel data constructed. (Go into how you construct)
  * Mitigates the shortcomings of other fraternity works using Campus Safety Security Data (Raghav)
* Further the college partying literature
  * Fraternities are a major partying source at universities - unclear what their impact is
  * Represent decrease in partying 
  * Closely links student behavior to partying

# The Pathway to a Moratorium

* Starts with triggering event -> announcement of moratorium -> end date
* Small delay between first and second 
* Announcement can be from one of two sources of jurisdiction
  * University Administration 
  * IFC council = students from fraternities at university

# Sample Construction

## Criteria:
* Must have some media coverage (web-searchable).
* Must have temporary campus-wide ban of alcohol from fraternity parties for IFC fraternities (can have more).
* Must have Daily Crime Logs in readable format.

## Final Sample:
* 38 universities with 45 moratoriums total (mean: 1.36, max = 3).
  * Do not represent the universe of moratoriums (Google/Lexis Nexus/Documents).
  * Some universities were left out (4 known).

.pull-right[
### Benefits:
* Incidence-level reports mandated by Federal government.
* All reports
* Caveat: Needs Harmonization

### Construction:
* Use unique university police-department Daily Crime Logs
* Match on specific offenses using regular expressions
* Merge with moratorium dates and IPEDs

### Example:
* East Carolina Crime Logs:
  * Incident Report 1: "Underage Possession of Liquor (1)"
  * Incident Report 2: "Consume Alcohol < Age 21"
* Change to lowercase, match on word:
  * Incident Report 1: "underage possession of <mark>liquor</mark> (1)"
  * Incident Report 2: "consume <mark>alcohol</mark> < age 21"

# Empirical Strategy

### Baseline specification:

$$Y_{u,t} = \beta Moratorium_{u,t}  + \gamma_{u} + \lambda \mathbb{X}_{t} + \epsilon_{u,t}$$

* $Y_{u,t}$ is an outcome of alcohol offenses or sexual assaults per-25000 enrolled students per academic-calendar day at university $u$ in time $t$.
* $Moratorium_{u,t}$ is an indicator variable equal to one when university $u$ is undergoing a moratorium at time $t$.
* $\gamma_u$ is a university-specific fixed effect.
* $\mathbb{X}_t$ is a vector of time-varying controls that are shared across universities.

*Intuition*: comparing academic-calendar days with a moratorium to academic calendar-days without a moratorium, while adjusting for fixed differences in universities and times of the year.
---
# Assumptions:

1. Moratoriums are as-good-as-random/common trends

2. Reporting does not change/Propensity to report does not change during moratorium.

3. No lasting effects of the moratorium

---
# Assumption 1:

### Moratoriums are good as random:

# Event Study: Alcohol Offenses

```{r, echo=FALSE}
es_alc_14_g
```

# Event Study: Sexual Assaults

```{r, echo=FALSE}
es_sex_14_g

# Assumption 2:
```{r}
source(here::here(paste0("advancement_presentation/tables/regressions_reporting.R")))
```

```{r}
## reporting_table
reporting_table_alc
```
---
# Assumption 2 Continued:

```{r}
reporting_table_sex
```

---
# Assumption 3:

* Event study gives preliminary evidence, but stay tuned for more results.

* The no-lasting effects allows for the criticism of DID estimator from Andrew Goodman Bacon

---
# Main Results:

### Alcohol Offenses
* Large decreases in reports of alcohol offenses during moratoriums. 
  * Driven by the weekends (Friday-Sunday).
  * Transient effects.

### Sexual Assaults
* Weaker evidence of decreases in sexual assault
  * Large decreases, only 10% significance on weekends only.
  * Likely lacking power.

# Potential Mechanism

## Is the moratorium displacing crime?

* Difficult to answer - there does not exist a perfect data source
  * National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) $\rightarrow$
  * Uniform Crime Reporting System (UCR) 

## Indirect Test:

* Use the Campus Safety and Security Data (CSS)
  * Downfalls: Aggregated to calendar year, not 1-1 match with Daily Crime Logs.
  * Benefits: Contains good location data: on-campus/off-campus and 

This is **not** causal! 
---
# Potential Mechanism: Model

### Specification:

$$Y_{u,t} = \beta Moratorium_{u,t}  + \gamma_{u} + \lambda_{t} + \epsilon_{u,t}$$

* $Y_{u,t}$ is an outcome of alcohol offenses or sexual assaults per-25000 enrolled students per-calendar day at university $u$ in time $t$.
* $Moratorium_{u,t}$ is the fraction of calendar-days treated within a year.
* $\gamma_u$ is a university-specific fixed effect.
* $\lambda_t$ are calendar-year fixed effects.

*Warning*: This is not causal, only speculative due to the data limitations.

# Potential Mechanism: Results

```{r}
clery_compare
```

---
# Robustness:

### Poisson Estimation:

* Helps with count-data. Results similar—30 and 31 percent average reductions for alcohol offenses and sexual assaults on the weekends.

### Leave-one-out Estimation

* Is one university driving these results?

### TWFE Literature

* Several papers have shown issues with DID in TWFE models with heterogeneous effects
* Changing model to TWFE with group = university and time = day-by-month-by-year gives 0 negative weights and consistent results.

### Inclusion of Never-Treated

* Results are similar
