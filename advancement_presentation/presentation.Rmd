# Background: A wide-spread tradition

## Benefits of Fraternities:
  - Community service, volunteering, graduation rates, and future income ([Mara, Davis, and Schmidt 2018](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/coep.12249); [Hayek et. al. 2002](https://scholarworks.iu.edu/dspace/handle/2022/24308); [Asel, Seifert, Pascarella 2009](https://scholarworks.wm.edu/oracle/vol4/iss2/2/))

--

## Downsides of Fraternity Membership:
  - Risky Behavior (e.g., hazing, sexual assault) ([Hechinger 2017](https://www.amazon.com/True-Gentlemen-Broken-America%C2%92s-Fraternities/dp/1610396820); [Seabrook 2019](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07448481.2019.1679153); [Minow and Einolf 2009](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1077801209334472))
  - Binge drinking and college partying ([DeSimone 2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167629607000069); [Routon and Walker 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214804314000147))
  - Access to alcohol for lower classmen ([Armstrong, Hamilton, and Sweeney 2006](https://academic.oup.com/socpro/article-abstract/53/4/483/1711176?redirectedFrom=fulltext))

--

Recently, campus administrators began to use temporary campus-wide bans of fraternity social events with alcohol (moratoriums) to change behavior.

--

<font color="blue">**Question**</font>: How do these moratoriums affect alcohol offenses and sexual assaults?

---

# Moratoriums

--

## Moratorium Definition:

A temporary <font color="blue">*campus-wide*</font> halt on fraternity social events with alcohol.
  - Applies to Interfraternity Council fraternities (IFC) $\rightarrow$ primary type of social fraternity.


--

## Sources of Enforcement:
  - University Administration <font color="blue">(62%)</font>
  - IFC Council $\rightarrow$ student enforced <font color="blue">(38%)</font>

# How might a moratorium affect behavior?

.pull-left[
### Moratoriums may be beneficial:
* College partying leads to more rape and alcohol ([Lindo, Siminski and Swensen 2018](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20160031))
* Restricting alcohol + higher penalty leads to less drinking ([Liang and Huang 2008](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hec.1321))
* Alcohol increases mortality, poor academics, and crime. ([Carpenter and Dobkin 2009](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.1.1.164); [Carrell et. al. 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047272710001143); [Ha and Smith 2019](https://www.proquest.com/econlit/docview/2301876286/BCBDC18DDCE14ACCPQ/7))

.pull-right[
### Moratoriums may be detrimental:
* Displacement of crime
  * Partying in riskier places
* May cause large increases after moratorium is over $\rightarrow$ net effect could be worse due to pent up demand ([Brassiolo 2016](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/683666?casa_token=Gm7R4k8X_3IAAAAA%3ARrrOrCv8KEDwFZuKpRNK14jsDvxfCsKqFWINiScXkJW_AixQk1h4l8sCaQX1hiYosOujUNIA7cQ))

# Research Question

### Question: 
* How do fraternity moratoriums affect campus-wide police reports of alcohol offenses and sexual assault?

### Novel Data: 
* Construct data set from Daily Crime Logs from university-specific police departments (2014-2019).

### Identification: 
* Exploit the variation in timing of the moratoriums using a difference-in-differences design.

---
# Contribution

* First study to evaluate moratoriums. 
* Novel data constructed. 
  * Mitigates the shortcomings of other fraternity works using Campus Safety Security Data + survey data ([Raghav and Diette 2021](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3908875); [DeSimone 2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167629607000069); [Routon and Walker 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214804314000147)).
* Further the college partying literature (e.g., [Lindo, Siminski and Swensen 2018](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20160031)).
  * Fraternities are a major partying source at universities $\rightarrow$ provides evidence what their impact on partying is.
  * Closely links <font color="blue">student</font> behavior to partying.
  * Represent decrease in partying $\rightarrow$ reason to expect asymmetries ([Cunningham and Shah 2018](file:///Users/michaeltopper/Zotero/storage/KUI5MLJN/4756165.html))
---
# Sample Construction

--

## Criteria:
* Must have some media coverage (web-searchable by Google/Lexis-Nexis).
* Must have temporary campus-wide ban of alcohol from fraternity parties for IFC fraternities (can be more extensive).
* Moratorium must be in sample period of <font color="blue">2014-2019</font> $\rightarrow$ Daily Crime Log archive length + avoid pandemic.

--

## Final Sample:
* 38 universities with 45 moratoriums total (<font color="blue">Mean: 1.36</font>; <font color="blue">Max = 3</font>).
  * Large universities (<font color="blue">Enrollment Mean: 28k, Min: 3k, Max: 60K</font>)
  * Differences in selectivity (<font color="blue">Graduation Rate Mean: 70, Min: 39, Max: 95</font>)
* Does not represent the universe of moratoriums (4 known missing).

# The Pathway to a Moratorium

<font color="brown sand">Triggering Event</font> $\rightarrow$ <font color="darkgreen">Announcement/Implementation of Moratorium</font> $\rightarrow$ <font color="red">End Date</font>.
* Small delay between triggering event and implementation.
* Announcement/Enforcement can be from one of two sources of jurisdiction:
  * University Administration 
  * IFC council $\rightarrow$  students from fraternities at university

### Benefits + Construction:
* University police departments only.
* Incidence-level reports mandated by Federal government.
* All reportsâ€”caveat: needs harmonization.
* Match on specific offenses using regular expressions
* Merge with moratorium dates (public records requests/news articles/fraternity advisers), IPEDS, and academic-calendars.
]

# Matching Process:

```{r}
source(paste0(here::here("Tables/matching_word_table.R")))
```


```{r}
matching_table %>% 
  gt() %>% 
  tab_header(title = "Words and Phrases used to Pattern Match")
```


--

### Example of the Matching Process:
* East Carolina Crime Logs:
  * Incident Report 1: "Underage Possession of Liquor (1)"
  * Incident Report 2: "Consume Alcohol < Age 21"
* Change to lowercase, match on word:
  * Incident Report 1: "<mark>underage</mark> possession of <mark>liquor</mark> (1)" $\rightarrow$ counts as 1.
  * Incident Report 2: "consume <mark>alcohol</mark> < age 21"



---
# Empirical Strategy

### Baseline specification (OLS):

$$Y_{u,t} = \beta Moratorium_{u,t}  + \gamma_{u} + \lambda \mathbb{X}_{t} + \epsilon_{u,t}$$

* $Y_{u,t}$ is an outcome of alcohol offenses or sexual assaults per-25000 enrolled students per academic-calendar day at university $u$ in time $t$.
* $Moratorium_{u,t}$ is an indicator variable equal to one when university $u$ is undergoing a moratorium at time $t$.
* $\gamma_u$ is a university-specific fixed effect.
* $\mathbb{X}_t$ is a vector of time-varying controls that are shared across universities.
* Standard errors clustered by university.

*Intuition*: comparing academic-calendar days with a moratorium to academic calendar-days without a moratorium, while adjusting for fixed differences in universities and times of the year.
---
# Main Results:

### Alcohol Offenses
* Large decreases in reports of alcohol offenses during moratoriums (<font color="blue">27%</font>). 
  * Driven by the weekends (Friday-Sunday).
  * Transient effects.

### Sexual Assaults
* Weaker evidence of decreases in sexual assault
  * Large decreases (<font color="blue">26%</font>) of 10% significance on weekends only.
  * Likely lacking power.

# Assumptions:

--

### 1. Timing of moratoriums is as-good-as-random
  * "Multiple Event" Event Study 

--

### 2. Reporting behavior does not change
  * Indirect test: Changes in proportion of crimes reported with a lag?

--

### 3. No lasting effects of the moratorium
  * Event studies + Analysis shown

# Robustness:

### Poisson Estimation
* Good for count-data with non-negative outcomes.

### Leave-one-out Estimation
* Makes certain not one university is driving the results.

### TWFE Literature
* Heterogeneous treatment effects likely $\rightarrow$ estimate a new model that has 0 negative weights.

### Inclusion of Never-Treated
* Read about in the paper!

---
# Potential Mechanism

## Is the moratorium displacing crime?

* Difficult to answer with the Daily Crime Logs.

## Indirect Test:

* Use the Campus Safety and Security Data (CSS)
  * Downfall: Calendar year aggregation.
  * Benefits: Contains good location data: delineate between where on-campus crimes occur.
* Slightly change the treatment definition: fraction of days in year that contains moratorium.

---
# Heterogeneity:

### What type of triggering event causes the largest effects?

* Behavior Violation
* Sexual Assault
* <font color="blue">Fraternity-related Death</font> $\rightarrow$ shows largest effects for decreases in alcohol.

### How long until a moratorium is effective? 

* Split into 3 quantiles: [0, 32 days], <font color="blue">[33, 57 days]</font>, [58, 541 days].

### What type of oversight works best?

* <font color="blue">University</font> vs. IFC Council 


---
# Conclusion

### Main Takeaways:
* First study to estimate the causal effects of fraternity moratoriums.
  * Find <font color="blue">27%</font> decrease in alcohol offenses $\rightarrow$ effects are transient.
  * Find weaker evidence of decreases in reports of sexual assaults (10% significance), although large magnitude
  (<font color="blue">26%</font>) on weekends.
  * Possible mechanism is displacement of crime to safer areas (e.g., residence halls).
* I construct a novel dataset. 
  * Mitigates issued with commonly used data such as NIBRS/UCR.
* Potential research $\rightarrow$ deferred recruitment/barring of singular fraternities.
* This study does not advocate for removal of fraternities.

# Gunshot Violence and Birth Outcomes

### Gunshot Violence and Birth Outcomes with Anna Jaskiewicz
* <font color="blue">Motivation</font>: Maternal stress during gestation can have negative effects such as pre-term delivery and low birth weight ([Aizer et. al. 2015](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w18422/w18422.pdf))
* <font color="blue">Question</font>: How does exposure to gunshot violence affect birth outcomes?
* <font color="blue">Setting</font>: Chicago, IL
* <font color="blue">Data</font>: 
  * ShotSpotter: uses microphones to identify exact location of gunshots. Rollout in 2017.
  * Illinois Birth Data: Contains mother characteristics + home address
* <font color="blue">Main Idea</font>: Match mothers to exposure of gunshot violence and compare birth outcomes from mothers on one street who received more exposure to those on a street slightly further away that did not receive as much exposure.

# Police Shifts and Use of Force 

### Police Shifts and Use of Force with Toshio Ferrazares

* <font color="blue">Motivation</font>: Previous work has shown how shift length can affect performance ([Brachet et. al 2012](https://repository.upenn.edu/hcmg_papers/67/)).
* <font color="blue">Question</font>: How does length of police shift affect police use-of-force?
  * Setting: Chicago Police Department + Louisville Metro Police + LAPD (pending decision)
  * Variation: 12 hour shifts vs. 8 hour shifts.
  * Variation: Multiple shifts in a row (e.g., 3 days) vs. fewer shifts in a row (2 days).
* <font color="blue">Data</font>: Universe of police shift lengths beginning in 2014 in addition to use-of-force reports.
  * Detailed use-of-force incidents allows for positional analysis.
