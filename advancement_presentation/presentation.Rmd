# Background

Fraternities are a widespread tradition in the US.

## Benefits of Fraternities:
  - Community service, volunteering, graduation rates, and future income.
  
## Downsides of Fraternity Membership:
  - Risky Behavior
  - Binge drinking and college partying

Recently, campus administrators began to use temporary campus-wide bans of fraternity social events with alcohol (moratoriums) to change behavior.

**Question**: How do these moratoriums affect alcohol offenses and sexual assaults?

# Moratoriums

## Moratorium Definition:

A temporary *campus-wide* halt on fraternity social events with alcohol.
  - Applies to IFC fraternities (e.g., social fraternities)
  - Popularized in the mid-2010s.

## Sources of Enforcement:
  - University Administration
  - IFC Council (student-enforced)

# How might a moratorium affect behavior?
.pull-left[
### Moratoriums may be beneficial:
* Fraternities are source of alcohol for underage drinking ()
  * College partying leads to more rape and alcohol (Lindo)
  * Restricting alcohol harsher leads to less drinking (Lin)
  * Alcohol has shown to increase mortality, poor academics, and crime.

.pull-right[
### Moratoriums may be detrimental:
* Displacement of crime
  * May cause large increases after moratorium is over - net effect could be worse
  * Partying in riskier places

# Research Question

### Question: 
* How do fraternity moratoriums affect campus-wide police reports of alcohol offenses and sexual assault?

### Novel Data: 
* Constructed from Daily Crime Logs from university-specific police departments (2014-2019).

### Identification: 
* Exploit the variation in timing of the moratoriums using a difference-in-differences design.

# Contribution
* First study to evaluate moratoriums. (Go into why this is the first)
* Novel data constructed. (Go into how you construct)
  * Mitigates the shortcomings of other fraternity works using Campus Safety Security Data (Raghav)
* Further the college partying literature
  * Fraternities are a major partying source at universities - unclear what their impact is
  * Represent decrease in partying 
  * Closely links student behavior to partying

# The Pathway to a Moratorium

* Starts with triggering event -> announcement of moratorium -> end date
* Small delay between first and second 
* Announcement can be from one of two sources of jurisdiction
  * University Administration 
  * IFC council = students from fraternities at university

# Sample Construction

## Criteria:
* Must have some media coverage (web-searchable).
* Must have temporary campus-wide ban of alcohol from fraternity parties for IFC fraternities (can have more).
* Must have Daily Crime Logs in readable format.

## Final Sample:
* 38 universities with 45 moratoriums total (mean: 1.36, max = 3).
  * Do not represent the universe of moratoriums (Google/Lexis Nexus/Documents).
  * Some universities were left out (4 known).

# Empirical Strategy

### Baseline specification:

$$Y_{u,t} = \beta Moratorium_{u,t}  + \gamma_{u} + \lambda \mathbb{X}_{t} + \epsilon_{u,t}$$

* $Y_{u,t}$ is an outcome of alcohol offenses or sexual assaults per-25000 enrolled students per academic-calendar day at university $u$ in time $t$.
* $Moratorium_{u,t}$ is an indicator variable equal to one when university $u$ is undergoing a moratorium at time $t$.
* $\gamma_u$ is a university-specific fixed effect.
* $\mathbb{X}_t$ is a vector of time-varying controls that are shared across universities.

*Intuition*: comparing academic-calendar days with a moratorium to academic calendar-days without a moratorium, while adjusting for fixed differences in universities and times of the year.

# Assumptions:

1. Moratoriums are as-good-as-random/common trends
2. Reporting does not change/Propensity to report does not change during moratorium.
3. No lasting effects of the moratorium
