ongoing_notes_decisions

Here are some notes/decisions I have made and that I should remember about the project going forward:

- I decided to omit Miami University-Oxford from the sample because I could not verify the reopening date with any faculty or public information requests. moratorium start: 2/20/18. Event end: ?. Trigger: hazing. IFC enacted.
- University of North Florida will  be omitted as well (for now). This is due to the discrepancy of information I receive from different departments - FOIA office says no moratorium, newsarticles say different. One news article says "self imposed moratorium" for 2 month. I am not confident enough in these to keep them in the sample. Information I previously had: University of North Florida moratorium date: 12/4/17 end date: 12/18/17. University enacted. Alcohol disbanded. Behavior shut down. email verificatoin. 
- Northridge should be deleted from the sample? only one with no alcohol event ban. Might want to get Terry to look into this one. 


Things that you need to get done before finalizing results:
- add in SDSU moratorium in 2014 from "take back the night". This will be a giant pain in the ass.
- figure out what you want to do with northridge.
