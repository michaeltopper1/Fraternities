ongoing_notes_decisions

Here are some notes/decisions I have made and that I should remember about the project going forward:

- I decided to omit Miami University-Oxford from the sample because I could not verify the reopening date with any faculty or public information requests. moratorium start: 2/20/18. Event end: ?. Trigger: hazing. IFC enacted.
- University of North Florida will  be omitted as well (for now). This is due to the discrepancy of information I receive from different departments - FOIA office says no moratorium, newsarticles say different. One news article says "self imposed moratorium" for 2 month. I am not confident enough in these to keep them in the sample. Information I previously had: University of North Florida moratorium date: 12/4/17 end date: 12/18/17. University enacted. Alcohol disbanded. Behavior shut down. email verificatoin. University of North Florida is now deleted (5/27/21). This is because of the email I received that indeed, there was no moratorium, it only lasted for maybe 1 day until they decided they had no jurisdiction to do so.
- Northridge should be deleted from the sample? only one with no alcohol event ban. Might want to get Terry to look into this one. 


Things that you need to get done before finalizing results:
- add in SDSU moratorium in 2014 from "take back the night". This will be a giant pain in the ass.
- figure out what you want to do with northridge. 



Academic calendars:
- I used the most recent academic calendar found online
- used the first day of classes minus a 7 day period for start
- used the finalized grade date for end of semester
- added a 7 day period on the tail of spring semester
- used the first day of classes minus a 7 day period for start of spring (unless earlier than January 7)
- for quarter system schools, defined semester 1 as fall quarter, semester 2 as the combination of winter and semester.
