To do

Exclude from analysis dates between June 1 and August 31 as Lindo et al did because students are less likely to be in town.

Control for holidays in NIBRS

Using NIBRS, should look at how many know the victims (60% in lindo) 

Create Reports of Rape double histogram by month for fraternity closures and for not fraternity closures. Another for college partying schools

Additional IPEDS stuff to get:
	- SAT writing, math, critical reading
	- Retntion rate
	- Fraction private schools
	- Fraction receiving federal grant- aid


Graph comparing the schools in my data set to all schools.

Graph comparing my law enformce
Recreate Table 2 in Lindo

Princeton party school rankings over time

- Getting the fraternity membership and size at each university is worthwhile, but maybe save this task for a later iteration of the paper. Start doing this now, using FOIA requests to campuses using the websites you have saved
- Likes the idea of substitution effects - can look at campus police reports and see if there is some substitution away from certain types of crime because of the moratoriums
- Not all shutdowns are the same - interact some of these things with the treatment variable
- Right now, I have a binary treatment variable. Instead, use a non-binary one. For instance, if some school was treated 11/30 days of the month, do 11/30 * 1 for treatment. This should not change the coefficient estimates

To do for 290 paper:
- hold off on getting things - but start trying to send emails for FOIA
- run poisson regressions/log regressions
- demonstrate a proof of concept - convey that you have a random experiment 
- do not say you have random variation.



Oct. 27 remarks:

- Tables and writing need to be self contained. Talk about them each as if they do not appear.
- list the covariates I'm using with some summary statistics?
- IFC website for background--focus on the actual facts rather than opinions
- get pre-trends graph!
- try regression with levels and log - Poisson as well
- explain more how the schools were chosen
- need proportion of undergrads
- house fixed effects?
- rape vs. sexual assault. Be explicit between the two
- UCR changed the definition of a rape at some point in time. Remember to take this into consideration.
- more explanation on the tables - footnotes
- do people substitute away from rape and go to over crimes?
- Clery Act requires colleges to report campus crime policy and statistics


Nov. 14
- Need to look at how each university provides jurisdiction over their fraternities
