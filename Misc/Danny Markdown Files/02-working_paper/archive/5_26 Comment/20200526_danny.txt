The first sentence needs to go / be changed.


Paragraphs should be indented, makes it paper more visually easy to read through.


Page 2 second paragraph: "For example, y0t may represent GDP of UK...." I think this is too hedgy.
Instead: "For example, let y0t represent UK GDP in period t prior to Brexit, and y1t..."


I think the intro has *too much* detail insofar as equations are concerned. The second sentence of
the model section references an equation from the intro! Idk why but that feels weird. The intro can
totally have simple equations, but I think the argmin lines are a bit too much detail for an
introduction.


"Work Cited and References" ---> "References" or "Cited Works"

The motivation of the paper has *most* of the things it needs, though I think much of it is out of
order and / or not made extremely clear. The first paragraph basically says that "Economists want to
measure the effect of X on Y and they do so using method Z. This paper proposes using method Z'."
After you say that method Z' allows you to do *other* things like get time-varying coefficients,
which is presumably important for something else.


A better way, I think, to come at the motivation is something akin to the following. "Economists
want to measure the effect of X on Y, and they do so using method Z. Unfortunately, method Z does
not adequately address issues of ______. Because these issues are important (perhaps you give
examples of why its important), the present paper suggests using method Z' which _______ (you
briefly describe what method Z' does).


The reason why I would argue that the second way is better is because it doesn't imply that method Z
is trying to accomplish the same things as method Z'. Rather, it proposes that method Z' can do new,
interesting things. It might also subconsciously piss off people who don't like synthetic control /
Bayesian stuff.


Section 3: The priors. Ok, yea all priors are left up to the researcher, and your following Park and
Casella (2008). It turns out that this choice creates what we call a "Bayesian Lasso." Etc. Etc. All
of these things are true (I'll take your word for it) but I think it's ordered in a weak way. I
think your usage of the Bayesian lasso should be more "active voice." That is... "In this paper I
consider a Bayesian Lasso approach. Such a strategy involves choosing priors such that ____ (Park &
Casella, 2008). This approach is particularly appealing because..." Also it would be nice to note
what, specifically Park and Casella do, maybe: "They construct a conjugate prior such that ____."


To add to the previous point, the first paragraph of this section is effectively a list of
citations; I don't actually know what a Lasso is yet. All I know is that a few people have written
papers in the area (it reads too much like a lit review when I feel like it shouldn't).


Section 4 paragraph 1. A closed form does not exist for the posterior. Therefore, a Gibbs sampler
must be used." I don't think this is true, there are other sampling methods that allow you to sample
from an unknown distribution that are *not* Gibbs samplers. For e.g. why couldn't you use a
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm?
