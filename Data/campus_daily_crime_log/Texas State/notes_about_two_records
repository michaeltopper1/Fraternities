notes_about_two_records
Michael,

 

I hope these answer your questions,

 

There is some overlap between the two documents, this will be shown by the case numbers.
The overlap begins from June 2019 through August 2019.
The case numbers are unique to that particular case.
 

For future reference, please note that a request for the Daily Crime and Fire Log is not considered a Public Information Act request. The Daily Crime and Fire log is considered a public document and anyone may have access to the log, whether or not they are associated with the institution per the Clery Act. Additionally, we are required by the Clery act to make any portion of the log that is older than 60 days but not older than 7 years, available within two business days of a request for public inspection. Contact us if you have any questions.

 

Thank you,


- furthermore, I have not finished this concatenation of these two files (Jan. 20, 2021). I still need to do this.
