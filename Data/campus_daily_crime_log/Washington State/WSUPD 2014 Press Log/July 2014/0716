               versus fence. No injuries. I am waiting on Housing to inform me
               of cost of damage. DRIVER 1: Abeer A. Rashed (100868) VEHICLE
               1: 2003 Dodge Caravan (WA/053ZLE) INSURANCE: State Farm
               2062573B2347 DAMAGE: front driver's side quarter panel
               scratched and dented. Driver's side mirror removed. $650
               Vehicle struck apparoximately 30 ft of chain link fence at
               Valley Crest apartments. Waiting on damage estimate from
               Housing. NARRATIVE: On 071614 at approximately 1733 hours I was
               dispatched to a collision that Pullman PD was not able to
               locate in their jurisdiction and dispatch had determined
               through a language barrier that it may be in ours. I eventually
               located the 1 vehicle collision on NE Ellis Way approximately
               200 meters west of Ferdinand's lane terminus. I spoke with
               Abeer A. Rashed (100868), Usama E. Zaher (101668), and Ahmed U.
               Zaher (080196). They had all been in the vehicle and had been
               wearing seatbelts. No one was injured. Rashed had been driving
               and Usama was teaching her. Rashed stated that she must have
               mistaken the gas pedal for the brake pedal. They had been
               driving downhill, east to west. In the downhill curce, Rashed
               attempted to brake but accelerated, careened off about a 30 ft.
               section of chain link fence that was about 4 ft. tall. The
               vehicle had been moved back into the roadway before I arrived.
               I took photos of the vehicle and the fence. I provided Rashed
               with my business card and the Sector exchange of information. I
               informed them that most likely Rick Fadness of Risk Management
               would be in touch regarding the fence. They left and 2
               unidentified student Housing workers arrived and I showed them
               the damage. I gave them the pertinent information regarding the
               case to give to their boss, Michael Burt. I am waiting on Burt
               to give me a damage estimate. Case pending estimate. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.
               Dated this 16th day of July, 2014 in Pullman, Washington.
