               threatening tone to them. NAME/DOB:Warner, David Perry

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 07-03-14 I was contacted by Marcia
               McNannay about a possible situation involving Barbara Aston and
               David Warner. Aston was requesting someone contact her at her
               232-A French Ad. Office. I called Aston on the phone. Aston
               stated that over the last few weeks David Warner had posted on
               facebook his dis-satisfaction with WSU and Aston in particular.
               Aston told me that the final straw was when she got a voice
               mail from Warner stating that if he didn't get a check he was
               going to make her go away. I asked he what she thought that
               meant. She said that she didn't want to jump to any
               conclusions, but she thought it meant he was going to get her
               fired. She said that she has known Warner for several years. He
               always was helpful and cortical, but after the incident on 03-
               30-13, Pullman Case #13-P02727, he has changed. He can no
               longer put cognitive sentences together. She said she is no
               expert on his type of injuries, traumatic brain injuries, but
               he seems confused and gets easily frustrated. I asked Aston
               what Warners main concern is. She said that he thinks he has
               been asked to teach this summer and feels disrespected because
               Aston and WSU hasn't informed him of when he is to teach, nor
               paid him. I asked if WSU asked him to come teach and she said
               "No, he no longer has any WSU affiliation." I ask Aston what
               kind of threats he made and she said he has been posting on
               Faith Price's and Autumn Jones' Facebook that Aston was going
               to loose her job and that she was going to go away. He stated
               that Aston was a racist. He made reference that they should
               call the tribes of Washington and Nez Perce to confirm his
               story. Jones advised Warner that he felt he was being
               discriminated against to contact the Office of Equal
               Opportunity. He just repeated for her to contact the tribes.
               Aston told me that Warner was also frustrated with Michael
               Holloman. Holloman is the Director of Crital Culture, Gender,
               Race Studies (CCGRS). That was who Warner worked for prior to
               the 2013 incident. I asked Aston if she had copies of the
               facebook posts and she said she did. I told her I would come to
               her office and pick up a copy. Upon my arrival I spoke with
               Aston and Faith Price. The were very concerned about the

               facebook posts, but were more concerned about the statement he
               made on the voicemail that Aston would be going away. I asked
               both if they thought Warner was violent. Both stated that they
               didn't know. Prior to the incident they would have said no, but
               they aren't sure now. The incident they are referring to is
               that Warner was physically beaten near a bar on Greek Row. They
               said that he spent a considerable amount of in in the hospital,
               The beating cause severe brain damage. I spoke to the two about
               Warner prior to and after the incident. Aston thought it would
               be best if I contacted Warners father Dennis. She stated that
               she has know him for years and seems to be able to talk and
               reason with David. I got copies of the phone records of Aston,
               the facebook posts from Jones and Prise's pages. The pages
               stated pretty much what Aston and Price had told me. I told the
               two I would be looking into the situation. I gave them advice
               on their personal safety and what to do in case Warner came to
               the office. I told them I would contact Dennis Warner first to
               get some advice on how to deal with David. I told them to feel
               free to call 911 or the police department if Warner escalated
               or came to the office causing problems. Both said they would
               and I left the office. When I got back to the department I did
               some research and found where Warner lives. I found there were
               no weapons permits or weapons offenses related to either Warner
               males. I called Dennis Warner on the phone. I explain to him
               that I was investigating some facebook postings and a voicemail
               that David had sent/posted. I asked him if David had access
               weapons/guns. He said he didn't. I asked him if they were going
               to counseling and he said they were, but it is very slow going.
               David suffers greatly due to his injuries. I asked him what he
               thought the best way to handle the situation was. He said that
               he would talk to him and explain that it is very inappropriate
               to be threatening anyone and that if it continues there was a
               possibility WSU would trespass him. I asked if David knew he no
               longer had any affiliation with WSU. Dennis said that David has
               received several letters stating those facts. I asked Dennis on
               a scale from 1 to 10 if he though David would harm anyone and
               he said 0. He didn't believe he had it in him to harm anyone. I
               asked Dennis to let me know how the conversation with his son
               went. He said he would. I told him I was going to refer this
               case to OEO they would probably be contacting him. He said that
               would be fine. I told him if he had any suspicions that David
               might be escalating to please call 911. He said he would and we
               ended the call. I called Aston and informed her of the
               conversation I had with the father and that there were no
               weapons in the home. She was grateful and we ended the call. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this ____ day of _____________, 2014, in
