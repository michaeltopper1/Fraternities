        Incident Address : WSU Campus
                           PULLMAN              WA 99163

        Time Reported: 08:09
    Time Occurred between: 17:00:00 07/29/14 - 09:51:00 07/30/14

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: DT/321 dd/329 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W2718 SYNOPSIS: RP reported his parking
               permit was stolen from his vehicle while he was parked in the
               Red 2 lot behind the Indoor Practice Facility. No suspects or
               leads. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               07-31-14 at approximately 0809 hrs. Cpl. Daniels and I got
               dispatched to Parking Services for a theft of parking pass from
               a vehicle. Parking Services told us Walter S. Sheppard (DOB 03-
               30-54) was the one who had his pass stolen and would like to be
               contacted via phone. On 07-31-14 at approximately 0855 hrs. I
               tried contacting Sheppard, but was unable to reach him so I
               left him a voicemail. At approximately 0940 hrs. Sheppard
               returned my phone call. I asked Sheppard where he thought his
               parking pass got taken from and he said the Red 2 lot behind
               the Indoor Practice Facility because he parks there everyday
               for work. I asked him when the last time he actually saw his
               parking pass, but he said he could not remember. He said if he
               had to guess he would say it was taken between sometime in the
               evening of 07-29-14 and sometime on 07-30-14 before
               approximately 0500 hrs. I later saw the ticket for his vehicle
               was issued on 07-30-14 at approximately 0951 hours. I asked
               Sheppard if he locked his vehicle during those times and he
               said he may have locked it, but not sure. He told me he usually
               does not lock his vehicle while he is in Idaho or if he will
               not be away from his vehicle all day. I advised Sheppard he
               should probably make sure his vehicle is locked from now on,
               especially on campus. I asked him if anything else appeared to
               be missing from his vehicle and he said no. I asked him if he
               knows anyone that may have taken it and he said no. I asked him
               for the number on his parking pass and he said it was RD 2-5090
               that expires on 08-22-14. I gave Sheppard the case number and
               told him if he happened to find his parking pass he needed to
               contact Parking Services immediately, otherwise his tire may be
               locked and he would be financially responsible to get it
               removed. No suspects or leads. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 31st day of
               July, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.

    Narrative: RVWD: 316 / Macy OFC: dd/329 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W2721 SYNOPSIS: RP reporting he received
               a scam email. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 07-31-14 at approximately 1439 hours, I contacted
               Chad Koch in the WSU PD lobby reference a possible scam. Chad
               stated he had received an email from a subject claiming to be
               an attorney stating he was passed due on a cash loan and was
               going to be charged with a crime for not paying. He stated he
               had not responded to the email at all because he had a similar
               incident occur back in March. He said then a male with an
               Indian accent had threatened him over the phone and tried to
               tell him he was going to get arrested if he didn't pay them
               money. At the time he had borrowed money from a cash loan place
               but thought he had paid it back. In March he reported the
               incident to Pullman PD (Case #14-P02529). I looked at the
               letter and could clearly see it was a scam due to grammar, and
               the generic reference to a law firm and laws he supposedly
               violated. I tried calling the number provided and a male with
               an Indian accent answered the phone. When I tried to clarify
               what law firm he was with, he stated I was a criminal and was
               going to arrested. I advised him I was a police officer and
               what he was doing was fraud and he was to stop. He said, "try
               and stop me". I disconnected the call. I advised Koch the email
               was definitely a scam and to ignore it. He stated his main
               concern was they had his social security number which was
               printed on the email. I asked him if he had done a credit check
               on himself lately and he stated he subscribes to a credit
               monitoring company already. I also advised him to file a claim
               with IC3.gov and explained the process to him. He stated he
               would. I gave him my business card and advised him to contact
               me if he needed anything further. I cleared. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               31st day of July, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.
