               NARRATIVE: On July 13, 2014 at about 0715 hours an unknown
               woman approached Cpl Daniels and I outside of the WSU Police
               Department. She told us she heard an alarm coming from one of
               the brick building on College Ave. Cpl Daniels called WSU
               Facilities Operations suspecting it was their chiller or well
               building. On this same day at about 0746 hours Pullman Fire and
               WSU Police were dispatched to the report of a chlorine alarm
               activation at Wellhouse #7 on College Ave. Whitcom dispatched
               the fire response as a "charlie". Cpl Daniels and I responded
               to the area. I was the first emergency responder to arrive on
               scene. I staged at College Ave and Spokane Street. There was no
               wind blowing at the time. I could hear the ear piercing audible
               alarm coming from Wellhouse #7. I could see Pullman Fire
               responding from Main Street. They responded without lights or
               sirens. Pullman Fire units staged at the bottom of College Ave
               near the railroad tracks. Pullman Fire personnel evaluated the
               situation. A team of two (2) firefighters wearing turnouts and
               breathing apparatus approached the building. They had problems
               with their chlorine detector as it would not zero out. The
               detector kept reading negative numbers. They did however make
               entry into the main room where the building chlorine detector
               unit is located. The building unit was reading zero. The entry
               team told me they could see through a window into the chlorine
               room. The team saw a few drips of an unknown liquid on the
               chlorine pipes. They were not sure if it was chlorine or water
               condensation. Pullman Fire personnel requested addition fire
               personnel to deliver another chlorine detector. The second
               detector had the same issue of displaying a negative number.
               Eventually all doors to the building were opened and the two
               (2) chlorine tanks were inspected. One of the firefighters
               heard a quiet hissing noise coming from the chlorine tanks. The
               tanks were shut off and the hissing stopped. The building was
               aired out for about 15 minutes. Pullman Fire personnel deemed
               the area safe and released the scene to WSU Facilities
               Operations. Pullman Fire personnel explained the incident to a
               WSU Facilities Operations maintenance troubleshooter who was on
               scene. The Pullman Fire personnel did an excellent job of
               investigation, communication, and scene safety. The chlorine

               alarm and the burglary alarm were reset. All units cleared the
               scene at about 0839 hours. WSU Facilities Operations dispatch
               was attempting to notify EH&S personnel of the incident as well
               as the personnel who operate and maintain the wells. To my
               knowledge they were not able to actually speak with anyone
               while we were on scene. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 13th day of July,
               2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               NARRATIVE: On July 13, 2014 at about 1002 hours Pullman Fire
               and WSU Police were dispatched to the report of a chlorine
               alarm activation at Wellhouse #7 on College Ave. Whitcom
               dispatched the fire response as a "charlie". This was the same
               alarm as earlier in the morning. Cpl Daniels and I responded to
               the area. I was the first emergency responder to arrive on
               scene. I staged at College Ave and Spokane Street. There was a
               slight breezing blowing toward the west at the time. I could
               hear the ear piercing audible alarm coming from Wellhouse #7. I
               could see Pullman Fire responding from Main Street. They
               responded without lights or sirens. A single Pullman Fire unit,
               PL31 staged at my location. The truck was carrying only two (2)
               personnel. No other fire units or personnel responded. Pullman
               Fire personnel evaluated the situation. A team of two (2)
               firefighters wearing their duty uniforms consisting of a t-
               shirt and pants approached the building. They were not wearing
               or using any personal protective equipment. This is not the
               same fire crew who responded earlier. I watched the
               firefighters walk up to the front door with their instruments
               in hand. They had a chlorine detector, a 4 gas detector and a
               thermal imaging camera. I did not observe them make entry into
               the building. They walked around the building and then returned
               to my location. They were only at the building for about two
               (2) minutes. Capt. Turpin spoke the WSU Facilities Operations
               troubleshooter. Capt. Turpin told him that this was a false
               alarm and that Pullman Fire will not respond to this alarm
               again today until it is repaired. After the brief conversation
               Pullman Fire personnel left the scene. They were only on scene
               for about 10 minutes. The chlorine alarm was still sounding and
               to my knowledge the building had not been cleared. I did not
               see the fire personnel make entry. After Pullman Fire left the
               scene I spoke with the troubleshooter. He was in disbelief that
               Pullman Fire did not silence the alarm or clear the building. I
               notified Cpl Daniels of the situation as she was blocking
               traffic at the bottom of the hill. WSU Facilities Operations
               called in a Life Safety troubleshooter to assist. He arrived at
               about 1036 hours. I briefed him on the incident. I approached
               the building with both troubleshooters. There was no odor of

               chlorine from the exterior. I unlocked the main doors to the
               pump room. I opened the large double door and let the room air
               out before we made entry. The Life Safety troubleshooter
               entered and silenced the chlorine alarm. Both troubleshooters
               could see into the chlorine room through a window. They saw
               where a liquid had been dripping from the pipes mounted on the
               wall onto the floor. This was more liquid than what had been
               there earlier in the morning. I opened the chlorine room and
               let the room air out before anyone made entry. It appears that
               chlorine may have leaked from the piping system. Even though
               the bottles were shut off there was still chlorine in the
               chlorine piping system. The first group of firefighters told me
               that chlorine gas can freeze up when it leaks. Once it freezes
               it will form an ice barrier and not allow any more gas to leak
               out. Typically the ice barrier will melt once the gas flow is
               shut off. When the barrier melts the leak site is exposed and
               additional product can escape. This is a plausible answer for
               the second leak of chlorine gas. The troubleshooters had their
               dispatch center contact supervisors about repairing the system.
               They were instructed to take the chlorine alarm off line and
               the repairs will be made tomorrow, Monday, July 14, 2014. The
               chlorine alarm was disabled, the burglary alarm was reset. In
               summary there was an actual discharge of chlorine gas in the
               chlorine tank room. It appears there is a leak in the pipes
               between the chlorine tanks and where it enters the water supply
               in the the chlorine room. The leak consisted of the gas left in
               the supply lines. It did not appear that the tanks were leaking
               once they were shut off. Cpl. Daniels left a message for Chief
               Gardner regarding the chlorine leak. No further investigation.
               I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws
               of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 13th day of July, 2014, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer

               NARRATIVE: On 07/13/14 at approximately 1949 hours, I was
               dispatched to a recovered stolen golf cart that was abandoned
               behind the SRC by the basketball courts. Upon arrival I
               contacted Jake H. Mason 02/07/91, who works for Campus Commons.
               Mason said he noticed that the golf cart that usually is
               located near the pool area of Campus Commons North was missing
               when he arrived at work around 1100 hours. Mason later found
               the golf cart sitting behind the SRC. Mason had spoken to
               several employees who stated they last remembered seeing the
               golf card at CCN on Friday 05/11/14 around 1830 hours. Mason
               stated there was some new damage to the roof, steering wheel,
               and ignition area. The roof had scraps on it as if it had been
               tipped over. The steering wheel was missing a padded section
               where the horn button would be. Mason believed that someone had
               jammed something into the ignition to force the ignition to
               turn. I was able to turn the ignition with a different key than
               the golf cart key. The damage to the golf cart is estimated at
               $400 dollars. Mason said he had already spoken to a few people
               who were playing basketball nearby. Mason said one of the
               people had seen the golf car on the street on Friday night. I
               contacted Sheldon G. Shirley 03/15/95 who stated he was at a
               friends house near the intersection of Stadium Way and Lower St
               when he saw four white males driving the golf cart. Shirley
               said he watched the males drive the cart back and forth on
               Stadium Way and at one point the guys hit a trash can. Shirley
               said he did not have a better description other than college
               age white males. Mason was provided with his case number. The
               golf cart was still driveable and Mason drove it back to CCN.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 13th day of July, 2014, in
