    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: DMJ/338 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W2689 07/27/14 SYNOPSIS: Chlorine alarm
               at Wellhouese 7. A small chlorine leak was found. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On July 27, 2014
               at about 0723 hours Pullman Fire and WSU Police were dispatched
               to the report of a chlorine alarm activation at Wellhouse #7 on
               College Ave. Whitcom dispatched the fire response as a
               "charlie". I responded to the area and was the first emergency
               responder to arrive on scene. I staged at College Ave and
               Spokane Street. There was no wind blowing at the time. I could
               hear the ear piercing audible alarm coming from Wellhouse #7. I
               could see and hear Pullman Fire responding from Main Street.
               They responded with lights or sirens. A Pullman Fire unit
               staged on College Ave near the wellhouse. A second Pullman Fire
               unit staged at my location. Pullman Fire personnel evaluated
               the situation. A team of four (4) firefighters wearing turnouts
               and breathing apparatus approached the building. They did
               however make entry into the main room where the building
               chlorine detector unit is located as well as the chlorine room.
               They detected a small amount of chlorine leaking from the piped
               system between the bottles and the well. The amount detected
               was very minor and just having the door open aired out the
               room. The tanks were shut off. Pullman Fire personnel deemed
               the area safe and released the scene to WSU Facilities
               Operations. Pullman Fire Capt. Turpin explained the incident to
               the WSU Facilities Operations maintenance troubleshooter who
               was on scene. Fire personnel suggested letting the building air
               out for a few minutes. They put fire tape around the doorways.
               The Pullman Fire personnel did an excellent job of
               investigation, communication, and scene safety. Pullman Fire
               silenced the chlorine alarm before leaving the scene. WSU
               Facilities Operations dispatch attempted to notify the
               personnel who operate and maintain the wells. They had to leave
               a message for the well maintenance person. I remained on scene
               with the WSU Facilities Operations worker. We did not want to
               leave the area with the chlorine and well doors open. After
               waiting for about 30 minutes we went to the building and
               removed the fire tape. I saw a few drips of an unknown liquid
               on the chlorine pipes. This is the same area that was leaking a
               few weeks ago. I assisted the WSU Facilities Operations worker
               with resetting the burglary alarm and setting the air
               circulation fan to remain on in the chlorine room. The system
               will be repaired tomorrow, Monday, July 28, 2014. No further
               investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
