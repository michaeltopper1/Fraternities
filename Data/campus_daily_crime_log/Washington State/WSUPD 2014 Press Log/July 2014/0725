               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W2669 07/25/14 SYNOPSIS: Disabled
               blocking vehicle on Spokane Street at Stadium Way. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On July 25, 2014
               at about 0940 hours I was dispatched to a disabled vehicle on
               or near Stadium Way at East Main Street. I responded to the
               area where I located an unoccupied blocking disabled vehicle.
               Officer Welter located the driver at the gas station on East
               Main street. She was on her way back to the vehicle with fuel.
               The female driver was driven back to her vehicle by another
               female friend. She identified herself as SMITH, Tavia J.
               (10/02/90). I assisted her with refueling the vehicle.
               Unfortunately the vehicle would not start because the battery
               was dead. Officer Welter responded and assisted with jump
               starting the vehicle. I asked Whitcom to check Smith's driving
               status. She does not have a valid driver's license. Smith only
               has an identification card from California. I educated her
               about driving without a valid license. Smith's friend,
               Whittaker, Maarkita D. (06/18/91), had a valid driver's license
               and moved the vehicle once it was running. Assistance provided,
               no further investigation. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 25th day of July,
               2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W2674 SYNOPSIS: Report of a possible
               verbal domestic dispute on North Fairway Rd near the Outdoor
               Recreation Center. The subjects left the area travelling
               towards Terre View Dr and were gone upon our arrival. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 072514 around
               1351 hrs Ofc Jones and I were dispatched to a report of a
               possible domestic between a male and female on North Fairway Rd
               near the Outdoor Recreation Center (ORC). As Jones and I were
               en route to the area we were told the subjects, described as a
               black male wearing a red baseball hat and driving a white
               sedan, and a black female wearing a red shirt who was running
               from the male, had left the area towards Terre View Dr. Jones
               and I attempted to locate the subjects without success before I
               contacted the reporting party, later identified as Callie B
               Mentzer (092584). Mentzer explained that she had been contacted
               by a patron who had seen the above described male driving along
               North Fairway Rd while yelling at the above described female
               who appeared to be running away from the vehicle. Mentzer went
               on to say a short time later a white sedan, of unknown make or
               model pulled into the ORC parking lot at what she described as
               a high rate of speed. The male then jumped out of the vehicle
               and began to run after the female, which had now run to the
               north side of the building. Mentzer went outside and asked both
               individuals if everything was all right at which point she
               described both parties as becoming nervous and then beginning
               to speak in a foreign language she did not recognize. Around
               this point the male returned to his vehicle while the female
               continued towards Terre View Dr and out of Mentzer's view.
               Around this point Mentzer told me she contacted Whitcom by
               phone and explained what she had seen. I asked her if she could
               provide any futher description of the male and she described
               him as being around 5'-9" and slender build and wearing a
               crimson WSU hat. She could not recall any other details
               regarding the male. When asked about the vehicle I was told it
               was a white in color sedan. She was unable to provide a make or
               model, but did believe it was a 2000's or new sedan which did
               not appear to have any body damage to it. I then asked about
               the female and was told she couldn't recall anything about her
               other than a red shirt and shorts. I confirmed they had both
               left heading towards Terre View Dr and asked how much time had
               passed between when she saw them and when she contacted
               Whitcom. She told me the time delay had been around 2 minutes
               from the time she had seen them outside until she had contacted

               Whitcom. I thanked her for her time and spoke with Jones who
               had also been searching the area. Jones had searched the area
               leading up towards the Palouse Ridge Golf Club and the Nez
               Perce apartments without success. He went on to tell me he had
               also checked the Marriott Hotel and they had not seen the male
               or female enter during the timeframe of this call. We continued
               to search the area and after speaking with several people who
               had been in the area and had not seen either individual we were
               unable to locate the subjects and cleared. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 25th day of July, 2014, in Pullman,

               approximately 1510 hours I was dispatched to a theft call that
               occurred at the SRC. I spoke with the reporting party, Steven
               Bryant, in the lobby of the WSUPD. Bryant said he was playing
               basketball at the SRC (at approximately 2030 hours on 07/24/14)
               and had set his bag down on the stairs near the courts. Bryant
               described the location as the west side of the courts. Bryant
               said his phone was missing from his bag when he was done
               playing. Bryant said nothing else was missing from his bag.
               Bryant said he has tried calling his phone several times, but
               it goes straight to voicemail. Bryant provided me with his
               Network ID and password for his WSU login, which I passed along
               to WSU IT for tracking purposes. Bryant provided me with the
               information for his phone, but did not have the serial number.
               I asked Bryant to email me his serial number when he returns
               home and finds the box. On 07/26/14 I will check the video
               footage at the SRC in an attempt to find a suspect.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W2679 SYNOPSIS: 25 ft long dumpster left
               in Spokane St. Set up stop signs to mitigate the problem.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 072514
               at approximately 1940 hours I found that a large construction
               dumpster had been left on Spokane St, near EEME. It had cones
               around it on the north side of the dumpster but none on the
               south side. The dumpster obstructed all but 3 ft of the
               southbound lane. I called Fac Ops dispatch to see if they could
               do anything. I was informed that they could not do anything
               until Monday. Ofc. Westerman and I retrieved more cones and
               stop signs from Fac Ops and set them up at the dumpster. I took
               pictures of the dumpster before we set up the cones. I will be
               informing Rick Fadness of Risk Management of the issue. We
               cleared and I later received a phone call from Fac Ops offering
               to set up stop signs. I informed Sgt. Macy of the issue when he
               came on duty. Nothing follows. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 25th day of
               July, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W2680 SYNOPSIS: WSUPD Officers assisted
               Pullman PD Officers on a domestic call at 105 NW Dillion, unit
               3. One subject arrested. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR#

               NARRATIVE: On 07/25/14 at approximately 2025 hours, Ofc.
               Petlovany and I were requested to respond to 105 NW Dillon St,
               unit 3 for a domestic call. Dispatch stated that the reporting
               party lives above unit 3 and could hear a female calling for
               help. The female was heard saying, "just give me some air." The
               reporting party also stated the female had been harassing the
               male. I was the first Officer to arrive and I noticed a 20's
               aged male holding a small child. The male said they were
               arguing in unit 3. As I walked up to unit 3 there was a female,
               later identified as April Alice Beyer 04/21/88, who was
               standing near the door way. Beyer was visibly upset and looked
               out of breath. Beyer was yelling for Kimberly and I told Beyer
               to come outside. Moments later two other people came out of the
               house, Kimberly Ann Moore 09/26/95 and Nathan K. McClain
               04/25/70. I told Beyer and Moore to sit down and had McClain go
               talk to Ofc. Gordon who had just arrived. I first spoke with
               Moore and asked what happened. Moore said she had been called
               by Beyer about 5 minutes before our arrival saying that she
               needed Moore to come over because Beyer was "being physically
               harmed." Once Moore arrived she found Beyer and McClain arguing
               verbally. Moore said it looked as if Beyer and McClain were
               going to get physical so she stepped in between them. I asked
               Beyer what happened. Beyer said that her and McClain had been
               arguing all day. Beyer said he had put her baby down to sleep
               and she was in the bedroom listening to music. Beyer said
               McClain started calling her racist names and threatened to
               throw hot coffee on her. Beyer said she went to the bedroom to
               get something out of the closet when McClain, "pinned me down
               in the closet, grabbed me by my throat, I lost oxygen for a
               couple of seconds, and then he let go, and I ran out the back
               door." Beyer said that was when she called Moore. I asked Beyer
               to describe the choking more, Beyer said she was knocked to the
               floor of the closet with her back against the back wall of the
               closet. McClain was standing over her choking her with both of
               his hands. I asked McClain if anything else hurt other than her
               neck. Beyer said no just her throat hurt. I looked at Beyer's
               neck and did not see any marks. However on Beyer's left cheek
               of her face, there was a bloody scrape below her eye. The mark
               appeared to have been caused by a fingernail. I later asked

               about the mark on her face and Beyer said she did not remember
               how she got it. Beyer said McClain and her have been dating for
               about 5 year and currently both live in unit 3. I spoke with
               Ofc. Gordon and told him what I had learned. Ofc. Gordon stated
               he would speak with McClain some more and asked me to ask Beyer
               about the marks on McClain's neck. I asked Beyer about the
               marks on McClain's neck and how they might have gotten there.
               Beyer said that she probably scratched McClain when she was
               trying to get him off of her. Ofc. Gordon arrested McClain for
               Assault 2nd DV. I provided Beyer with a ATVP Domestic Violence
               card. On the card was Beyer's Pullman PD case number and Ofc.
               Gordon's name. I explained the information to Beyer about the
               card. Shortly there after all units cleared. For further
               details see Pullman PD case 14-P02680. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 25th day of July, 2014, in Pullman,

               approximately 0030 hours I was driving near the ORC on N
               Fairway when I observed a vehicle (WA/291YBV) driving
               southbound. I noticed Rebekah K. Prater (081993) driving the
               vehicle. I continued patrolling and then noticed a vehicle
               parked crooked with it's lights on in the Grey Lot of N
               Fairway. I stopped and walked up to the car. I noticed it was
               the same car and Prater was getting out of the driver's seat
               and getting into the backseat. I asked Grayson O. Parr
               (061094), who had also gotten out of the car, what was going
               on. He explained that Prater wanted to get her license and he
               wanted to teach her to drive in the parking lot. I confirmed
               that he knew she did not have a license and that he allowed her
               to drive on N Fairway. He however was not the registered owner.
               I warned Prater for NVOL with ID and Parr for allowing an
               unlicensed person to drive. Ofc. Westerman had backed me up on
               this event. We both cleared. No further action. Nothing
               follows. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
