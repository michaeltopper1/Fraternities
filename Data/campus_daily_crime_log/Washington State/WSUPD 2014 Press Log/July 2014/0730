               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W2713 SYNOPSIS: Report of a verbal
               argument, and RP wanted help having the male subject leave.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 07-30-
               14 at approximately 1228 hours, Ofc. Welter and I responded to
               Valley Crest Apartment B-4 for the report of a verbal argument.
               The RP had reported she and her boyfriend had gotten into an
               argument and she had told him to leave. He refused and at one
               point she was able to lock him out of the apartment and called
               911. I activated my Axon camera when I arrived. We knocked on
               the door and Collette Pipkins answered the door. I could see
               she was crying and she was asked where the male was. She stated
               he was inside. Ofc. Welter went inside to contact him and I
               asked Collette to step outside to speak with me. I advised her
               I was recording our conversation. I asked her what they had
               been fighting about and she said it was over a conversation
               about transportation. She stated he started yelling and decided
               she had enough and told him to leave. She stated they had been
               dating for about three months and he has been living in her
               apartment for about one month. She stated nothing physical
               occurred, it was just verbal. She stated when she had told him
               to leave, he refused and that is why she contacted us. I
               verified there was nothing physical and she said correct.
               Collette also told me her lease is up on the apartment and she
               is in the process of moving out by Friday. I contacted Ofc.
               Welter and confirmed it was a verbal exchange only. The male
               was identified as Lamante McCaskey. He was upset over being
               kicked out and stated he was packing his items up and leaving.
               He stated he would not return to get anything else and told her
               to keep anything he left. While he was gathering his items, I
               provided a DV Card to Collette and explained it to her. Ofc.
               Welter provided Lamante with a DV Card and explained it to him.
               A friend came and loaded Lamante's items into his car. I gave
               the friend my business card and advised him to call if Lamante
               needed a civil standby later and he stated he understood. We
               remained on scene until Lamante left. We cleared. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               30th day of July, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 073114 at approximately 0130
               hours, I was in the area of Stadium Way and Monroe Street when
               I heard Pullman PD get dispatched to an assault call outside
               Stubblefields bar and the suspects were fleeing on foot. I
               drove up Monroe Street and saw a subject matching the
               description run across Monroe Street behind my car. A male
               pointed to the subject and yelled, "That's him" and pointed at
               the subject running. I turned my car around and followed the
               subject down Garfield Avenue to the gravel dead end where he
               ran through several yards and jumped a six foot chain link
               fence toward Maple Street extension. I radioed to Ofc. McNannay
               the direction of travel of the suspect and he was able to
               intercept the suspect on Maple Street. I responded to Ofc.
               McNannay's location and provided back up until he cleared the
               scene. Upon clearing that location, Ofc. Anderson asked me to
               assist him at Stubblefields for the continuing investigation. I
               responded to Stubblefields parking lot and provided cover while
               Ofc. Anderson conducted his investigation. I cleared shortly
               after. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the
