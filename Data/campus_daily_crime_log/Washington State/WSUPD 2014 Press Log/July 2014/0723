               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W2641 SYNOPSIS: Report of a gate, which
               covers a roof ladder, had been damaged at the Compton Union
               Building. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 072314 around 0820 hrs I was dispatched to a report of a
               gate which covers a roof ladder at the Compton Union Building
               had been damaged. Upon my arrival I learned that a previous
               case had been reported to Sgt Jacboson (See Case #: 14-W2570).
               I looked at the gate and noticed it had been bent, but the lock
               had not been damaged. The bent gate provided enough space that
               it was now possible to access the third floor roof by use of
               the ladder. I photographed the damage and later spoke with
               Megan E Autrey (011385) who explained that this incident was
               the second one recently and she had spoken with Sgt Jacobson
               previously. We discussed various ways to secure the area, which
               could be accessed various ways, to include installing cameras
               and posting signs. She told me they were currently having
               discussions on how to secure the area at which point I gave her
               my business card along with the case number before clearing. No
               suspects or leads at this time. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 23rd day of
               July, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.

    Narrative: RVWD: 316 / OFC: MFL/313 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W2645 SYNOPSIS: A WSU Department needed a
               "Civil Stand-by" as department administrators met with an
               employee. There was no need for assistance at the meeting.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 072314
               at about 1300hrs, I met with WSU HRS employees Suzette Yaezenko
               and Jamie Gecas, about an employee that works for the WSU
               Department of Crops and Soil Science. They needed police
               assistance to stand-by at a meeting in Johnson Hall at 1530hrs
               while they notified the employee that they were going to place
               him on "home assignment." At 1530hrs, I met with Suzette and we
               sat in room (119) near the main office of Crops and Soil
               Science. The Interim Dean, Ron Middlehammer, and the Department
               Chair, Jim Harsh, met with John Brabb. They gave Brabb the
               "home assignment" information and Brabb's demeanor remained
               calm while he walked out of the office. Harsh walked with Brabb
               out to Brabb's vehicle. The HRS employees informed me that
               Brabb's spouse had been placed on home assignment as well about
               two weeks ago. Officer Welter and Cpl Daniels observed Brabb
               drive away from his parking spot, but noticed him park in the
               lot outside of the CUE. He then got out and walked west toward
               the Shock Physics building while talking on his phone. He sat
               down by the Shock Physics building for a while and read his
               paperwork and then went inside the building. The WSU officers
               contacted him and he indicated that he was trying to contact
               his wife. He was a little irritated but left the building and
               went to his vehicle. He then drove away. It appears that
               Brabb's wife does work in Shock Physics in some capacity. Brabb
               also has two sons who work for Crops and Soil Science as well.
               Brabb's paperwork does not trespass him from the WSU Campus but
               does tell him that "While on home assignment you are not to
               report to your office, department, or college...other than as
               directed or approved by your supervisor, Jim Harsh." I will
               attach a copy to the Spillman Files. Brabb thinks that WSU HRS
               is "out to get him" and he was specifically talking about
               Suzette Yaezenko (her office is Hulbert 405c). Brabb was not
               trespassed because there is no past behavior that would
               substantiate a trespass order. Although employees were still
               counseled by HRS in case there is an emergency. Suzette will
               not be in to work tomorrow. HRS has asked that we provide some
               extra walking patrols throughout the first floor of Johnson
               Hall near the Crops and Soil Science office and the 4th floor
               of Hulbert for the next week or so. Nothing further at this
               time. MFL/313 I certify and declare under penalty of perjury

               wanted the WSU Police Department notified of a current no-

               NARRATIVE: On 07-23-14 I was contacted by a Sarah Hill. She is
               a future student and was told by her lawyer that she should
               advise the WSU Police Department that she has a current no-
               contact order against a Ryan J. Strayer. She stated that
               Strayer, while in possession of a firearm, had broke into her
               home and threaten to kill her and her family. He was convicted
               of the crime and sentenced to serve 7 years. I told Hill that I
               would assign a case number to document the information. She
               asked several questions about campus safety. I told her that if
               she ever heard that Strayer was on his way to Pullman to call
               us. She stated she would and then we ended the call. I had
               dispatch run Hill and Strayer through DOL and found that
               Strayer is currently in DOC Custody at WCC(Washington
               Correctional Center)-Shelton and that there is a current no-
               contact order. Nothing further.............. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
