               computer trespass regarding an online WSU student. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 07/17/14 at
               approximately 1600 I was notified that a computer trespass case
               was holding. I called the reporting party Rebecca H. Vandevord
               04/03/56 who is the director of E Learning. Vandevord stated
               that she had received an email on 07/01/14 from a person named
               "Sam Bekman" who wanted to notify her of an online student who
               was paying someone to do their assignments for her. Vandevord
               stated Bekman was claming that Yang was using a tutor who did
               all of Yang's assignments for her. Bekman stated he knew this
               because he "was involved with the one who recruits so-called
               tutors who take over the class." Bekman wanted Vandevord to
               shut the cheating down. Vandevord stated the accusation was
               investigated and there was no evidence of cheating found. About
               a week later 4 different posts were placed on the WSU Angel
               site that is used by online students. The posts were made using
               Yang's log in. The posts were: -"Fuck you niggers and jews" -
               "Yesssssssssssss" -"yourexamtaker@gmail.com is my daddy" -
               "yourexamtaker@gmail.com is paying someone to do this student's
               work" repeated 5 times Yang saw the posts and emailed Vandevord
               a few hours later stating that her WSU account had been hacked.
               Yang worked with "WSU abuse" and was able to fix her WSU
               account. I called Yang and left a message on her voicemail. I
               also went to Yang's residence, 1455 NE Brandi Way, C304, but
               nobody answered. I left my business card on Yang's door with
               instructions to call me. I also emailed Yang asking her to call
               me. I researched "Sam Bekman" and found nobody with that last
               name associated with WSU. I also did not find any Bekman's in
               Spillman. At approximately 1840 hours, Yang returned my phone
               call. Yang stated that someone had posted "dirty words" on a
               message board on Angel. Yang said she has no idea who put the
               messages on there or why she was targeted. Yang said its
               possible that she could have left a computer in a computer lab
               logged into her account but other than that she has never given
               her password to anybody else. Yang said she has changed her
               password now. Yang said she went back to China where she is
               originally from. Once Yang arrived in China, then she noticed
               the emails from Vandevord. Yang said she worked with Vandevord
               to clear up the situation. Yang told me that she had no idea
               who would use her account. I asked Yang if she knew Sam Bekman
               and Yang said no. Yang said she just wanted the incident
               documented in case it happened to someone else. I asked Yang if

               Yang said she did not she was just more concerned that her
               teachers might think she was cheating. I told Yang to contact
               me if anything else happened. I certify and declare under

               NARRATIVE: On 07-17-2014 at about 1847 hrs I was dispatched to
               a report of an injured person at the Student Recreation Center
               (SRC), located at 1105 NE North Fairway Road. Dispatch advised
               that an individual had been involved in a bicycle accident. I
               arrived on scene and contacted Mark B. Hall (DOB 09-06-1991)
               inside the SRC at the main entrance. Hall was bleeding from
               multiple lacerations on his head, nose, arms, hands, and legs.
               Personnel from the Pullman Fire Department arrived on scene and
               treated Hall's injuries. Hall stated that he had been riding
               his bicycle westbound on the pedestrian sidewalk which leads
               from the main entrance of the SRC towards Beasley Coliseum.
               Hall said he lost control of his bicycle, fell over the
               handlebars, and landed on the pavement. Hall was not wearing a
               bicycle helmet. Hall was transported to the Pullman Regional
               Hospital via a friend in a personal vehicle. I cleared the

               stated that the vehicle was swerving on the roadway. Barth

               Kamiak Apartments. Barth described the vehicle as a gold in

               Officer Westerman and I checked the Kamiak Apartments parking
