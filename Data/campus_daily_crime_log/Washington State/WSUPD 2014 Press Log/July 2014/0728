               graffiti were photographed. The custodian said she does not
               work on the weekends so the last time she saw the area's free

               I was dispatched to a citizen assist call at the Terrace
               Apartments. Dispatch stated the apartment coordinator,
               Elizabeth Thomas 11/19/78, needed assistance regarding a
               tenant. I contacted Thomas at her residence, Terrace, Unit 407.
               Thomas stated that she was instructed to plug the key hole for
               unit 116 by WSU Housing. Thomas stated that the occupant in 116
               was told to leave but was refusing to do so. Thomas stated that
               WSU housing was in the process of starting an eviction. Thomas
               stated that she was nervous that the occupant might be agitated
               with her which is why she wished me to come along. We walked to
               unit 116 and knocked on the door and nobody answered. Thomas
               keyed into the apartment. Thomas said it looked as if the
               occupant had cleared out most of their stuff. Thomas plugged
               the key hole and told me I could clear. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 28th day of July, 2014, in Pullman,
