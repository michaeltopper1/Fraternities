               WSU STUDENT: ____YES ____NO OTHER UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 07-
               09-14 at approximately 0901 hours, I responded to Murrow
               Communications East room 113 for the report of an Ipad which
               may have been stolen. I contacted the Rp, Denise, who stated
               the Ipad they use with their photo booth was missing. She said
               this morning she checked room 114 which is a student area and
               found the laptop bag sitting on the table. She said it was
               unusual for it to be out as it is usually stored in a cupboard.
               She looked in the bag and stated the laptop was still there,
               but the Ipad was missing. She said she is currently checking
               with the students to see if one of them has it, but wanted to
               report it missing in case it was stolen. She also stated on the
               other table a student had found a monitor cord laying on top of
               it which had been cut. I looked at the cord and it had a
               diagonal clean cut all the way through it which appeared to
               have been done with a knife or other sharp cutting object. She
               said at the time nothing else was missing, but later emailed me
               to report a banner with the Chinook Yearbook logo on it was
               gone. I have since been told the banner was found. I asked
               Denise when she thought the Ipad was last seen and she said
               around noon on 06-30-14. She stated she would look for the
               serial number for the Ipad as well as the mac address and a
               possible login so I could send the information to IT to have it
               flagged on the network. I advised her to contact me if they
               found anything else missing, or if the items were with a
               student and she stated she would. I cleared. I contacted IT and
               emailed the information to them. Denise emailed me later in the
               day and stated the Ipad had been located and was not stolen.
               She stated she was still looking into the damaged cord. I
               entered into property as damaged. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 9th day of

               09/13/57, works for McCluskey Services. Dep. Langerveld and I

               stated Gulick was in room 101 of the Food Services building. I

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 071014 at approximately 0000 hours, I
               was parked facing NB on SE Spokane Street when I noticed Crosby
               driving his 2006 Subaru Impreza SB on Spokane Street at a speed
               that appeared above the posted speed limit. I activated my
               vehicle's radar unit which displayed a speed reading of 31 MPH
               in a 20 MPH zone, and Crosby's vehicle was the only one in the
               radar field at the time of radar activation. I pulled behind
               the vehicle and activated my emergency lights. Crosby pulled
               his vehicle to the side of the road. I contacted Travis Crosby,
               identified by his WADL, and I advised him why I stopped him.
               While talking to Crosby, I smelled a strong odor of marijuana
               coming from the interior of his vehicle. I asked Crosby how
               much marijuana he had smoked and he told me he had smoked
               approximately 2-3 grams in the past 45 minutes. I asked him if
               he felt okay to drive and he told me he did. I asked him if he
               would be willing to get out of his car and he did. We walked to
               the east side of Spokane Street and spoke on the sidewalk. I
               asked him if he would be willing to perform some voluntary
               field sobriety tests and he told me he would. I administered
               the HGN test on Crosby and did not see any indicators of
               impairment. Crosby performed the nine step walk and turn test
               and I noticed he missed heel to toe on three steps and
               performed and improper turn. Crosby performed the one leg stand
               test and Crosby completed it without issues. Crosby performed
               the Romberg test and estimated the passage of 30 seconds in 30
               seconds and I noticed eyelid tremors. Based on the indicators I
               saw, I recommended to Crosby that we leave the car parked and
               he not drive for the remainder of the evening. He told me he
               was okay with that. I asked Crosby where they were going and he
               stated they were going to the movie theater. I asked him how
               much marijuana his passengers had smoked and he told me they
               both smoked a couple of bowls each at his house. I asked him if

               he provided the marijuana for each of his passengers and he
               told me he did. I asked him if they were 21 years old and he
               told me that neither of them were. I asked him where he
               obtained the marijuana and he told me he got it from a friend.
               Ofc. Petlovany contacted Jason Rogers in the front passenger
               seat and I contacted Loen Pham in the rear driver's side seat.
               Ofc. Petlovany asked Pham for his driver's license and he
               provided it. I asked Pham if he had any marijuana and he told
               me he did in his bag. I asked him if I could search his bag and
               he told me I could. Pham handed me a red draw string bag and I
               checked the contents of the bag locating a small plastic bag of
               GVM in a vitamin bottle. I removed the plastic bag and didn't
               locate anything else of evidentiary value in it. I asked Pham
               how much he paid for the marijuana and he told me he paid 20
               dollars for it. I asked Pham if he was smoking marijuana at
               Crosby's house and he told me he was. I asked him how much he
               used and he told me he had a couple of bowls. Ofc. Petlovany
               asked Rogers if he had any marijuana in his possession and
               Rogers handed him a small plastic bag containing GVM. Ofc.
               Petlovany asked Rogers if the marijuana was his and he stated
               that it was. Ofc. Petlovany confirmed that neither Rogers nor
               Pham were over age 21. I advised both of them that I was going
               to forward charges to the Whitman County Prosecutor's Office
               for possession of marijuana less than 40 grams. I explained to
               Crosby that I was going to file charges against him for
               delivery of a controlled substance. I explained to all three
               that I was going to also send this report of the office of
               student standards and accountability. They told me they
               understood. I returned to the police Department and logged the
               marijuana in to evidence. I weighed the marijuana in Rogers'
               bag which weighed 1.62. grams. Phamp's bag weighed 1.71 grams.
               Charges forwarded to the PA's office. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               10th day of July, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.
