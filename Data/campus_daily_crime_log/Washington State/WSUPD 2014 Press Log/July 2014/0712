               Ofc Jones and I were dispatched to an intrusion alarm coming
               from the computer lab in Avery Hall. Upon our arrival we
               contacted Carter N Odem (061993), who told us he had been
               called to deal with an IT issue in the lab and found the power
               out upon his arrival. He believed he had de-activated the alarm
               prior to entering but had inadvertently activated it by
               mistake. Facilities Operations confirmed the power outage and
               Odem reset the alarm prior to our clearing. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and

               approximately 1948 hours, I was requested to meet Ofc. Gordon
               at WSU Veterinary Teaching Hospital regarding a dying cat he
               seized at an animal problem call. Once at VTH the cat was
               turned over to the veterinarians. One of the doctors stated
               that the cat was not going to make it. Ofc. Gordon stated that
               the cat was found in the back of a pickup truck bed. There were
               also two other dogs at the same truck. Per Ofc. Gordon's
               request I responded to the parking lot of Paradise Creek
               Brewery where the other two dogs were located. Ofc. Gordon had
               already determined that the dogs most likely belonged to Marvin
               H. Mead 05/23/67. Mead was believed to be staying with his
               parents in the Pioneer Square Apartments. Ofc. Gordon and I
               went to room 402 where Mead was believed to be. We found Mead
               in unit 402 and asked him about his dogs. Mead said his dogs
               were out by his truck and Mead began to walk out of the
               building towards the parking area without prompt. Once outside
               the building Ofc. Gordon began his investigation regarding the
               dogs and cat. During the questioning Mead began to become more
               and more agitated. At one point Mead started to walk away and
               Ofc. Gordon told Mead he was not free to go. I cut off Mead's
               path and Mead said, "don't fucking touch me." Ofc. Gordon told
               Mead he was being detained and ordered him to place his hands
               behind his back. Mead complied and I was able to handcuff (D/L)
               without incident. While handcuffing Mead I noticed two knifes
               attached to his keys near his back pocket. Due to Mead's
               increasingly agitated state and since I already located one
               weapon, Mead was frisked for weapons. I located one other
               pocket knife in Mead's left front pocket. Ofc. Gordon read Mead
               his Miranda Rights. Ofc. Gordon and I walked Mead down to my
               patrol car where he was placed in the backseat. I rolled down
               both rear windows for Mead as Ofc. Gordon continued his
               investigation. After interviewing a few other people, Ofc.
               Gordon advised that Mead was going to be under arrest for
               Animal Cruelty. I returned to Mead and told him what he was
               under arrest for. I again read Mead his Miranda Rights off my
               department issued card. I asked Mead if he understood his

               rights and he said no. I re-read the Miranda Rights to Mead and
               this time he said yes he understood his rights. I transported
               Mead to the Pullman Holding Facility where he was placed in a
               cell. Once Mead was secured in a cell I cleared. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 07/12/14 at approximately 2202 hours
               Ofc. Boyd was dispatched to Northside Hall for a cold domestic
               incident. I recognized the names of the people involved from a
               harassment case I had received three days earlier (see case 14-
               W2475). I responded to Northside Hall along with Ofc. Boyd. We
               met with Aubrie L. Piper 11/29/87 who is the RED for Northside
               Hall. Piper stated they had heard of an incident between two
               residents, Kevin T. Griffin 06/07/96 and Gabriella R. Seeno
               10/29/94, that occurred around 1300 hours. Piper said that an
               argument occurred with Griffin and Seeno and Griffin was
               slapped during it. Piper also stated that Griffin had been over
               heard saying something to the effect of, "I'll find someone to
               kill you." Piper provided me with Seeno and Griffin's room
               numbers. Ofc. Boyd and I attempted to contact Seeno at her room
               but she did not answer. Ofc. Boyd called Seeno and Seeno
               answered. Seeno stated she was at a party on Maiden Lane and
               would walk back to her dorm. I called Griffin but he did not
               answer. I left a voicemail on Griffin's phone instructing him
               to call me. I was walking around Northside Hall looking for
               Griffin when I ran into Seeno. Seeno said she was just coming
               to meet us. Seeno said we could talk in her dorm room. Once
               Ofc. Boyd joined us I asked Seeno if I could record our
               conversation. Seeno said I could and I turned on my VieVu
               camera. I asked Seeno what was going on. Seeno said that since
               Griffin and her had broken up things have been getting out of
               hand. Seeno stated her and Griffin had dated for about one and
               a half years before they came to WSU. After arriving at WSU
               Griffin and her broke up. Seeno said Griffin came over to her
               dorm room around 1300 hours and was banging on her door. Seeno
               said Griffin continued to bang on the door till she let him in.
               Once Griffin came in to the room Griffin said he wanted
               everything back that he had given her. Seeno said Griffin
               started to grab a backpack and hat that were gifts from him.
               Griffin also wanted a bracelet back that he gave Seeno for
               Christmas. Seeno told Griffin that he could not take her
               things. Seeno stated that Griffin was getting very angry with

               her and Seeno was trying to calm him down. Seeno said Griffin
               has anger issues but he has never gotten physical with her. At
               some point Griffin was texting on his cell phone telling his
               friends to come into her room. Seeno said she took his cell
               phone away from him to prevent Griffin from taking her stuff.
               At some point during the argument Griffin called Seeno a slut
               and Seeno slapped him for saying that. Seeno said she slapped
               Griffin in the face with an open hand. I asked what happened
               after the slap. Seeno said Griffin would not leave till she
               gave him the bracelet back. Seeno stated she told Griffin to
               leave several times but he did not. Seeno said she opened the
               door and told Griffin's friends to tell him to leave. About
               this time Griffin left. Seeno said she had given Griffin his
               phone back before he left her room. Ofc. Boyd asked Seeno about
               an earlier comment she had made to him on the phone. Ofc. Boyd
               stated that Seeno had told him that she had prevented Griffin
               from leaving at one point. Seeno said early in their argument
               Griffin was going to leave her room but Griffin had taken some
               of the items that were gifts to her and trying to leave with
               them. Seeno stopped him by putting her body in front of the
               door. Ofc. Boyd asked Seeno if Griffin had threatened her
               during the argument. Seeno said other people were saying
               Griffin did but she did not think he did. Ofc. Boyd asked
               Seeno, "so he did not say, I'll find someone to hurt you."
               Seeno said, "well he says that all the time to everybody, but
               he has nobody to do it." I asked Seeno if at any point did she
               feel in danger or fearful for her life. Seeno said no. I asked
               Seeno if she felt Griffin would act upon his threat and Seeno
               said no. I asked Seeno she did or did not want future contact
               from Griffin. Griffin said she was willing to talk to Griffin
               and did not care if he talked to her. I told Griffin that I did
               not know what was going to happen with this case till I
               interviewed Griffin. Seeno was provided with a ATVP packet that
               contained her case number. I urged Seeno to stay away from
               Griffin for the time being. Ofc. Boyd and I were leaving the
               area when I thought I spotted Griffin. I pulled up to three
               males near the intersection of Colorado St and Monroe St. I
               recognized Griffin from a photograph and told Griffin that I
               needed to talk with him. As soon as I started to talk with
               Griffin he was visually upset and defensive. I asked Griffin
               what was going on between him and Seeno. Griffin said nothing
               was going on he has been trying to stay away from her but she
               keeps on "buzzing" him. Griffin said he went to Seeno's room to
               get his stuff and Seeno "spazzed out" on him. Griffin said
               Seeno "slapped me across my face, squeezing me all under here
               and shit, and grabbing my chest and shit." Griffin was
               describing that Seeno was grabbing onto his chest. Griffin told
               Seeno, "get off me, I'm not doing this shit, who are you."
               Griffin said he was cussing at Seeno because he was mad but he
               was not going to hit her. Griffin said he was deleting photos
               of the two of them he had posted to instagram from his phone.
               At that point Seeno took Griffin's phone from him. Griffin said
               he wanted to leave but Seeno had his phone. Griffin said he was
               sitting on Seeno's bed crying because he "gets really angry."
               Griffin said Seeno grabbed the lanyard that was around his neck

               and told him she hated him. Griffin stated once Seeno gave him
               his phone back he left. Griffin said Seeno slapped him multiple
               times and knocked out his earring. I asked Griffin if he had a
               mark on his ear from it. Griffin said no. I told Griffin it
               would be odd to be hit so hard that his earring came out and
               there would be no mark. Griffin said he did not know if he had
               a backing on the earring or not at the time. I asked Griffin
               why he went over to Seeno's room. Griffin said he wanted to get
               the backpack, hat, and bracelet back. I asked Griffin what the
               solution to the ongoing problem was going to be. Griffin said
               he did not know because Seeno followed Griffin here (WSU). I
               asked Griffin if he was concerned for his safety or wellbeing
               with Seeno being around. Griffin said no, "this hasn't really
               affected me." I told Griffin that it would be best for him not
               to talk to Seeno for the time being. I asked Griffin if he
               would like me to tell Seeno that he does not want any kind of
               contact from her. Griffin said, "I mean I don't care, I think
               she is going to leave me alone." I told Griffin unless he tells
               me to tell her not to contact him there is not a lot I can do
               for him. Griffin said he understood. I provided Griffin with an
               ATVP domestic violence packet along with his case number. Once
               I got back to the station I called Griffin's mother, Jennifer
               R. Calhoun 07/15/74, who had requested me to call her when I
               was speaking with Griffin. I called Calhoun and explained the
               situation. I spoke with Calhoun about the ways Seeno and
               Griffin were interacting. Calhoun sounded like she had a better
               understanding of the whole story after speaking with me. I told
               Calhoun to call me if she had any other questions. I contacted
               Bill Stevens of the Athletes Department in regard of my contact
               with Griffin. A copy of my report was emailed to him. Due to
               the unwillingness of both parties to go forward with charges or
               staying away from each other, no charges will be filed. This
               case will be referred to student conduct and WSU Counseling
               Services. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 13th day of July,
               2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               at about 0120 hrs Dispatch toned out a brush fire on College
               Ave across from the steam plant. They advised a steam plant
               employee was out with two subjects on the scene. I arrived and
               found the complainant Daniel W. Richards standing with two
               other males, later identified as Iokepa Hughes and Garrett A.
               Johnson. Richards told me he was driving up College Ave from
               the steam plant when he noticed Johnson and Hughes in the brush
               next to a storage building that is directly south from the
               steam plant, across College Ave. He thought this was suspicious
               so he reported it to his supervisor and turned around to see
               what Johnson and Hughes were doing. When he returned they were
               on the west side of the building and there was a small fire in
               the brush. He approached them and they all stomped out the
               fire. I asked Iokepa and Hughes what was going on and they told
               me they were bored and as they were walking by decided to see
               if the grass would burn. They admitted what they did was
               "stupid" and they shouldn't have done it. When asked what they
               used to start the fire Hughes produced a small Bic lighter and
               said they used the lighter. As I spoke to them I noticed they
               both appeared to be under the age of 21 and I could smell the
               odor of alcohol. I asked for their ID's and they each provided
               me with a Washington Driver's License, which confirmed they
               were under 21. I checked the area where Richard indicated the
               fire was. I confirmed there was a small patch of burnt grass
               approximately one foot square. The patch of burnt grass was in
               the middle of a large amount of other very tall dry grass which
               surrounds the storage building and is in direct contact with
               the storage building. The burnt patch it's self was
               approximately two feet from the side of the storage building.
               It was clear given the recent dry weather and the condition of
               the grass that the fire could have very quickly and easily
               become out of control. It was also clear the building was at
               great risk of damage or destruction should the fire have spread

               very far. The fire department arrived on scene and checked the
               area. The also spoke with Iokepa and Hughes about what they
               were doing and why they started the fire. After Pullman Fire
               left the scene I asked Iokepa and Hughes how much they had to
               drink. They each admitted to having had several drinks. I asked
               Hughes if I could check his eyes to see how much he had to
               drink and he agreed. I administered a horizontal gaze nystagmus
               test on him and observed he had bloodshot and watery eyes, a
               lack of smooth pursuit, and a distinct and sustained nystagmus
               at maximum deviation. I could smell the odor of intoxicants on
               his breath as I administered the test. I asked Iokepa if I
               could check his eyes as well and he agreed. I administered a
               horizontal gaze nystagmus test on him. I observed he had
               bloodshot and watery eyes, a lack of smooth pursuit, and a
               distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation. I could
               smell the odor of intoxicants on his breath as I administered
               the test. I told Iokepa and Hughes I would be forwarding
               charges to the Whitman County Prosecutor for Reckless Burning
               and MIP Exhibiting. Nothing further. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               13 day of July, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.
