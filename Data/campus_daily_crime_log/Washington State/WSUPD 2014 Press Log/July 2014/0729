               DEPARTMENT CASE #:14-W2705 SYNOPSIS:A WSU van almost caused a
               collision on Wilson near Lighty Student SVCS. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 07-29-14 I was
               dispatched to a traffic offense that had occurred at 1345
               hours. Taylor Casey was wanting phone contact concerning the
               way a WSU Van(WA/Lic 10949E) was driving. I called Casey and
               asked her to explain what had occurred. She said that she was
               on Wilson in front of Lighty. She was backing out of her
               parking spot when a blue vehicle came up behind her. The
               vehicle turned on it's turn signal as to indicate that they
               wanted to have her parking spot. She continued backing when all
               of a sudden a white WSU van passed the blue car. There was
               another vehicle traveling west on Wilson so the driver of the
               van had to swerve towards Casey to avoid missing her. Had Carey
               not seen the van passing she would have continued backing
               causing the van to strike her vehicle. I asked Casey if she saw
               who was driving the van and she said a white male was all she
               saw. I told her I would look into who was driving the van and
               counsel them on their driving habits. She said that she just
               wanted someone to know what had happen. We ended the call. I
               contacted the motor pool and found that the van is leased to
               Cooper Publications and that Leslie Little is the responsible.
               I contacted Little and she stated that the van is actually
               loaned to Cougar Copies and Hans Abbott is the responsible. I
               responded to the CUB and contacted Abbott. I informed him of
               the situation. He stated he knew who the driver was. He said he
               is gone for the day, but would speak to him. I told him that
               was fine, but to make sure he understood the seriousness of the
               situation. He said he would and I left the building. Nothing
               further................ I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 29th day of July,
