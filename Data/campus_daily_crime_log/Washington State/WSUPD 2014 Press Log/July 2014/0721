               burglary alarm at Beasley Coliseum. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 07-21-2014 at about 0701 hrs I
               was dispatched to a burglary alarm at Beasley Coliseum, 925 NE
               North Fairway Road. Dispatch advised that the alarm originated
               from the main office, and Wendy A. Miskin (DOB 07-10-1947) had
               called from the scene and stated that it was accidental. I
               arrived on scene, contacted Miskin, and determined that she was
               authorized to be in the building. Miskin said she had just
               entered the office and did not turn off the alarm properly.
               After speaking with Miskin, I determined that the alarm was
               caused by employee error. I cleared the scene. No further
               action at this time. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under

               SYNOPSIS: Bicyclist and a vehicle collided at the intersection
               of North Fairway Lane and North Fairway Road. No injuries to
               either party. DRIVER 1: Alethea Sharea Dumas 07/15/94 VEHICLE :

               Grand Sport DAMAGE : $100 damage to front wheel NARRATIVE: On
               07/21/14 at approximately 1623 hours I was dispatched to a
               unknown injury collision between a bicyclist and a car. The
               collision was called in by a passerby. Upon arrival I found no
               one in the described intersection. I finally found a male,
               later identified as Jacob William Ellis 08/04/85, walking on
               North Fairway near Beasly, carrying a bicycle on his shoulder.
               I stopped and asked Ellis if he was just hit by a car. Ellis
               said, "kind of." I asked Ellis to sit down in the grass just
               incase he had injuries. Ellis said he was not hurt other than a
               small scrape on his left hand. I asked Ellis what happened.
               Ellis said he was riding his bicycle southeastbound on North
               Fairway Road on the western sidewalk. Ellis said he was
               approaching the intersection of North Fairway Road and North
               Fairway Lane and saw a car stopped in the northbound lane of
               North Fairway Lane waiting to head through the intersection.
               Ellis said he slowed slightly and went into the crosswalk when
               the car pulled in front of him. Ellis said his front tire of
               his bicycle hit the front end of the car. Ellis went over the
               handlebars and fell to the ground. Ellis said he was able to
               tuck and roll and was not injured in the process. Ellis said he
               exchanged information with the driver, Alethea Sharea Dumas
               07/15/94. Ellis stated Dumas and he decided to handle the
               damage to the bicycle between them. Once medics arrived they
               evaluated Ellis and said he was good to go. I provided Ellis
               with his case number and my business card. I offered to give
               Ellis a ride home so he did not have to carry his bike. Ellis
               said he would rather walk home the exercise would be good for
               him. Photos of Dumas abrasion to his hand and damage to the
               bike were taken. The damage to the bike is estimated at $100
               dollars. I called Dumas who said she would meet me at the
               station. Once Dumas arrived at the station I asked her what
               happened. Dumas said she was about to pull into the
               intersection of North Fairway Lane and North Fairway Road when
               she looked to her right and saw the bicyclist on the sidewalk a
               ways down the way. Dumas said she looked to her left and it was
               clear. Dumas started to turn right onto North Fairway Road when

               the bicyclist came into the crosswalk hitting her passenger
               side front bumper. I asked Dumas if the bicyclist had stopped
               at the crosswalk before entering the crosswalk. Dumas said no
               he never slowed down. Dumas said she checked on Ellis who said
               he was ok. Dumas said Ellis and her agreed to settle the damage
               between each other. Dumas showed me the damage to her car. I
               found a small paint transfer mark on the passenger's side front
               bumper. There also was a transfer mark about 15 inches long
               between the license plate and the corner of the driver's side
               front bumper. The damage to the bumper is estimated at $200
               dollars. I provided Dumas with her case number and my business
               card. I took photos of the damage to Dumas' car which were
               added to the files folder. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 07/21/14 at
               approximately 1816 hours, I responded to a report of a
               cigarette disposal unit that was smoking. Upon arrival I found
               the disposal unit slightly smoking. There were no flames coming
               from the unit. Once the fire department arrive they opened the
               metal unit and poured three water bottles of water in the unit.
               The disposal unit had a fair amount of garbage in side which
               probably aided in the smoke. With the embers extinguished all
               units cleared. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 21st day of
               July, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W2630 SYNOPSIS: Report of a Ford diesel
               truck purposefully blowing black diesel exhaust all over the
               road and swerving. I located the truck at Terre View and Grand
               St. After my contact with the driver, the was no signs of
               impairment. The driver was warned for his manor of driving.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Robert P. Reidinger
               02/06/82 Warned Traffic None 2. NARRATIVE: On 07/22/14 at
               approximately 1921 hours, Pullman Officers were dispatched to a
               traffic offense in the area of SR 270 and mile post 5. Dispatch
               stated that the truck was weaving on the highway and
               purposefully blowing black exhaust everywhere. The caller
               believed the driver may have been impaired. I was notified of
               the call when the truck turned onto Stadium Way from East Main.
               After searching for the truck, I located it on Terre View near
               SEL. The truck came to a stop at Terre View and Grand Ave. The
               truck turned right and accelerated quickly which produced a
               large cloud of thick black diesel exhaust that covered both
               lanes of Terre View. When I caught up to the truck I noticed
               the truck also was lifted and had no mudflaps. I stopped the
               truck at Terre View and the bush fuel pumps. I contacted the
               driver, Robert Paul Riedinger 02/06/82, identified myself,
               informed Robert I was recording, and explained the call I had
               received regarding his truck. Robert said his truck was
               "chipped" and he also had a new turbo which made the truck have
               more exhaust. I told Robert that the caller had observed him
               quickly accelerating to the point that his tires and
               differential were shaking. Robert laughed my comment off say
               that he was not purposefully trying to make more exhaust.
               Robert stated that there was no way for him to fix his truck.
               Knowing enough about cars I know Robert's statements to be
               false. I ran Robert's information and he came back clear. I
               returned to Robert and warned him about how he drives through
               two. I also told him that he should take the chip out of his
               truck to prevent all the smoke. During the contact with Robert
               I did not see any signs of impairment. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 22nd day of July, 2014, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer
