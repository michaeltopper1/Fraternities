               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W2611 SYNOPSIS: Subject arrested, cited,
               and released for DWLS 3rd Degree. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Joseph Alan Hunt 10/01/70 Cited/Released DWLS
               3rd 4Z0740570 2. NARRATIVE: On 07/19/14 at approximately 1743
               hours I was driving eastbound on Colorado near Bohler Gym when
               a red Ford F150 pulling a large trailer pulled onto Colorado St
               in front of me. The trailer had several 50 gallon plastic drums
               in it along with two large pallets of construction materials.
               The two pallets were stacked on top of each other in the center
               of the trailer. From the pavement to the top of the pallets was
               approximately 11 to 12 feet high. It was abundantly clear if
               the truck stopped suddenly or swerved, the load would have
               shifted causing it to crash to the ground. I initiated a
               traffic stop for failure to secure load at Colorado St and
               Northside Hall. I contacted the driver, Joseph Alan Hunt
               10/01/70, identified myself, informed Hunt I was recording, and
               explained the reason for the stop. I asked Hunt if he had
               straps with him to secure his load. Hunt said he might and if
               not he could return to Hollingberry to grab some. I returned to
               my patrol car and ran Hunt through dispatch. Dispatch stated
               that Hunt was suspended through Washington in the 3rd degree.
               Once Ofc. Petlovany arrived on scene I recontacted Hunt. I
               asked Hunt if he had found any straps. Hunt said his wife was
               going to bring some over to him. I told Hunt that his driver's
               license was suspended. Hunt said he did not know it was
               suspended. I asked Hunt to exit his truck and he did. I told
               Hunt that he was under arrest for driving on a suspended
               license and handcuffed (D/L) him. I advised Hunt of his right
               to counsel and searched him incident to arrest. No weapons or
               illegal items were found. Hunt was placed in the backseat of my
               patrol car as I filled out a Sector citation. While filling out
               the citation, Hunt's wife, Shannon Rae Hunt 08/11/75, walked up
               to the scene. Ofc. Petlovany spoke with Shannon about the
               situation. Once the citation was completed, I explained the
               citation to Hunt, and provided him with his copy. Shannon's
               driver's license was ran and her return came back clear. Due to
               Hunt's license being suspended, Shannon drove the truck around
               the block and back to Hollingberry while Ofc. Petlovany
               followed. Once back at Hollingberry, Hunt fixed the load in his
               trailer. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 19th day of July,

               chicken wings. Assisted PPD as they were dealing with another
               issue and arrived shortly after us. No arrests at this time.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 072014
               at approximately 0217 hours PPD was toned out to a Theft at
               Dominos. PPD requested an AOA, so Ofc. Boyd and I responded.
               When I arrived I saw no acitivity in Dominos but some
               altercation taking place at the corner of Colorado and Monroe.
               I headed that way and the group broke up, walking in numerous
               directions. I was then flagged down by a male who said he had
               been in Domino's. He was obviously intoxicated with slurred
               speech and bloodshot watery eyes. I had him standby while I
               caught up with three males I had seen at the alteraction. Ofc.
               Boyd arrived and I had him speak with the intoxicated male. The
               3 males I spoke with were also highly intoxicated and stated
               they had held someone back from fighting. The three were
               Matthew J. Brunstetter (020491), Bryce A. Howald (092689), and
               Christopher A. Reinbrecht (051082). Ofc. Crowe arrived and
               spoke with the subject Ofc. Boyd was speaking with who was the
               original RP, Richard M. Griffiths (050994). Ofc. Engle arrived
               and spoke with Domino's employees. The 3 males I were with were
               determined to have assisted in diffusing the situation and were
               free to go. I cleared. A few minutes later Ofc. Boyd said he
               was out with other subjects involved in the event. He was at
               Northside Residence and I responded. Ofc. Engle and Ofc. Crowe
               also responded. I helped identify multiple subjects for them.
               It seems as though Griffiths had bumped into his friend who was
               carrying nachos that fell on the shoes of one of the males we
               were out with at Northside. Griffiths friend accused one of the
               males of knocking his nachos down. Griffiths then claims one of
               the group took their chicken wings. See Ofc. Engles report for
               more detail. All subjects were released and no arrest was made.
               We cleared. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 20th day of July, 2014, in
