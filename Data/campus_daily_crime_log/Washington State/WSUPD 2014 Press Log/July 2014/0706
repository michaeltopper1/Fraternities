               approximately 1656 hours I was stopped at the intersection of
               Spokane St and Campus Street facing northbound when I noticed a
               white Nissan sedan heading southbound on B St. As the Nissan
               came to the stop sign of B St and Campus St, the driver slowed
               slightly before driving thought the intersection. The driver
               made no attempt to stop for the stop sign. The driver turned
               left onto Spokane St and I initiated a traffic stop at Spokane
               St and Dana Hall. I contacted the driver, Charles Nathan
               Tillmon 06/17/92, identified myself, informed the driver I was
               recording, and asked Tillmon why he did not stop at the stop
               sign. Tillmon stated he "did a rolling stop." I asked for
               Tillmon's driver's license. Tillmon stated he forgot his wallet
               in his house. I asked Tillmon if he had any other forms of ID
               with him and Tillmon said no. I asked for Tillmon's vehicle
               registration and proof of insurance which he provided. Tillmon
               provided his name and date of birth verbally. Tillmon also
               provided the last 4 digits of his social security number. I
               returned to my patrol car and ran Tillmon through dispatch.
               Dispatch stated that Tillmon's driver's license had expired on
               06/17/14. About this time Ofc. Jones arrived on scene. I
               returned to Tillmon and asked him to exit his car. Once outside
               of the car, I told Tillmon that he was under arrest for driving
               without a valid driver's license. Tillmon was handcuffed (D/L)
               and searched incident to arrest. No weapons were found during
               the search. I read Tillmon his Miranda Rights and Tillmon
               stated he understood his rights. I told Tillmon the options for
               his car since it was sitting in a handicapped parking stall.
               Tillmon decided to let Ofc. Jones park it in a normal parking
               stall. Ofc. Jones parked the car and locked it up. I
               transported Tillmon to Pullman Holding Facility where he was
               fingerprinted and photographed. I issued Tillmon Sector
               citation 4Z0614600 for RCW 46.20.005 No Valid Driver's License
               without ID. I explained the citation to Tillmon and provided
               him with his copy. I gave Tillmon a courtesy transport to his
               friend's house on Lybecker St and cleared. Nothing further. I

               Pullman PD was requesting we respond to a domestic dispute at
               815 NW Lark St because they were all busy with another call.
               Officer Westerman and I responded. Upon my arrival I found
               Officer Westerman out with two males and one female. He
               directed one of the males, later identified as Michael T.
               Alexander, to come speak with me. I asked Michael what was
               going on and he told me the whole incident started on 07/04/14
               when he went to a work barbecue with a female co-worker,
               Kaitlyn I. Franz. His ex-girlfriend, Samantha J. Ripley, is
               also a co-worker and was at the barbecue. Ripley became upset
               when she saw Michael arrive with Franz but nothing further
               happened at that time. On 07/06/14 at about 2025 hrs Michael
               was outside his apartment barbecuing with Franz when Ripley
               drove by the apartment. She saw them together and texted
               Michael saying she was coming over to get her cats. Michael
               could tell she was upset and believed it was because he was
               with Franz again. He thought Ripley was using the cats, which
               they got jointly while they were dating, as an excuse. Ripley
               arrived about 5-10 minutes Ripley arrived. Michael and Franz
               went inside the apartment and closed the door. Ripley began
               banging on the door demanding to speak with Michael. He opened
               to door to try and calm Ripley down and she used it as an
               opportunity to push her way into the apartment. Ripley yelled
               at Franz telling her to leave so she did. Ripley and Michael
               argued for a while and Ripley told him she was not leaving
               until he promised not to see anyone else until she left town in
               a month. Michael contacted his father, hoping he might be able
               to help calm Ripley down. Michael's father, Roger T. Alexander,
               called the police when he learned of the incident from Michael.
               Michael said he and Ripley broke up about three months prior to
               the incident. They dated for about three years. Michael told me
               he and Ripley both lived in the apartment prior to their break
               up and that Ripley was still on the lease even though she no
               longer had a key and was not paying rent. I spoke to Officer

               Westerman and he told me Ripley's account of the incident was
               the same except she said Michael pushed her from behind after
               she forced her way into the apartment. I asked Michael about
               this and he said he did not push Ripley at all during the
               incident. I attempted to contact Franz on the phone but was
               unsuccessful. I left a message requesting she call me. Michael
               did not wish to move forward with any criminal charges against
               Ripley. He asked that I tell her if she had to speak with him
               at work that was fine but he wished to have no contact with her
               outside of work and did not want to see her at the apartment
               again. I told him he should have her name removed from the
               lease as soon as possible. Roger said he was happy to act as a
               go between if Ripley needed to contact Michael for something. I
               spoke to Ripley and told her what Michael wanted. She said that
               was fine and asked what was going to happen with the car she
               has been using because it belongs to Michael. I asked Michael
               about the car and he said prior to the incident he planned on
               signing it over to Ripley and after some discussion with his
               father decided he was still going to do that so she could take
               the car. I provided Michael with my business card and a DV
               crime victims packet. After returning to the WSU police station
               I attempted to contact Franz again but was unsuccessful. I was
               also unable to locate a local address for her. I will attempt
               to contact her again on 07/07/14. More to follow. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               07 day of July, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.
