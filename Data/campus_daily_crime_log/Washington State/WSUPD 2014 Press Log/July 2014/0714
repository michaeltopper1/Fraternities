               071414 at approximately 0856 hours I was dispatched to a
               welfare check in Yakama Village. A man was reportedly talking
               about impending tsuami's and was shaking. Ofc. Boyd, Asst.
               Chief Hansen, and I responded. We arrived and found numerous
               residents outside who were concerned about the subject and
               themselves. The subject was reportedly behind the N building
               under an apartment window. We located the subject and he was
               cowering in a corner with a suitcase on top of him for
               protection. The subject was eventually identified as Michael H.
               Weideman (102257). Weideman was stating the that an tsuami was
               on it's way from the north. He would then point out other
               tsunami's coming from the south. From where we were at we
               overlooked Pullman and Weideman was pointing to locations where
               he saw tsunami's. Weideman appeared to have lost bladder
               control and was sweating more than us who were wearing body
               armor. I eventually got him to take the suitcase off of
               himself. He stated he had Parkinson's and that he heard voices.
               He kept asking the easiest way to get down to Bishop Blvd. He
               claimed to have been seen at the Long Beach, CA VA hospital. He
               stated he had recently come from Beaverton, OR and may have
               been in Spokane. He never stated what he was being treated for
               at the VA. He said he had called the Spokane VA several times
               and could not get through. I said I could take him to the
               hospital in Pullman and they could help him. He agreed to go
               voluntarily. We walked him to my patrol car and he gave
               permission to be searched, to include his luggage. I told him
               he would be in handcuffs to ride in my car and he was okay with
               that. In his pockets I found two knives and Astrolube. These
               were removed and given to Ofc. Boyd for safekeeping. Weideman
               then asked where we were going. I told him we were going to the
               hospital as we had talked about. He said he did not want to go
               to the hospital but that he wanted to go to a restaurant. I had
               never offered to take him to a hospital. I then placed Weideman
               in protective custody. Ofc. Boyd rode with me to PRH and Asst.
               Chief Hansen followed us. I turned Weideman over to medical
               staff and completed the protective custody form with Dr.
               Bergmann. A scanned copy is attached to the case. I informed
               the medical staff of what I knew and about the location of the

               NARRATIVE: On 071414 at approximately 1057 hours I was
               dispatched to malicious mischief. I spoke with Kappy Brun of
               Facility Operations. She informed me that they had found 3
               instances of tagging on Campus. The locations were the Power
               Plant on College Ave, ETRL, and Owen Science Library. The tags
               were "zyk" or "nyk". She thought they were new from this
               weekend. I responded and found a red tag on the eastern side of
               Owen Science Library at the motorcyle parking area. The tag was
               "zyk" or "nyk". I took a photo of it. I then found another tag
               at ETRL on the western loading dock door. This was a very large
               tag covering approximately 70 sq ft. The tag included the same
               initials twice, a large face, possibly a hand extending it's
               middle finger, and then something unidentifiable. I took photos
               of each. I then spent an hour looking for the 3rd tag. I called
               Fac Ops several times for assistance. Once I was told it was on
               a green utility box. Eventually, I went and retrieved the
               original reporting employee. He showed me the grey utility box
               located in the red parking lot along Spring St. The same
               initials were tagged on the box and they appeared old. The
               other two appeared to be recent. This utility box was
               approximately 312 ft from the Power Plant. I took photos of it
               as well. I returned the employee to his work area and cleared.
               No suspects and no leads. Nothing follows. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of

               was the subject of an investigation regarding methamphetamines,
               burglary, and malicious mischief. I watched Cox while Ofc.
               Harris spoke with motel staff. Once Ofc. Harris was done with
               Payton, I cleared and looked for a suspect red Suburban
               vehicle. I checked The Grove, Pimlico, Cougar Ridge, and Chief
               Joseph construction sites. I could not find the vehicle. I
               cleared. Nothing follows. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 14th day of July,
               2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               approximately 1616 hours, I responded to a panic alarm at the
               WSU children center. Upon arrival I found parents picking up
               their children as if everything was normal. Once I walked
               inside I found no emergency. I spoke with Aaron A. Alonzo who
               is an employee. Alonzo was surprised that the alarm had went
               off. Alonzo looked at the alarm and there was a child sitting
               at the counter next to it. The child accidentally hit the
               alarm. Finding no emergency I cleared. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 15th day of July, 2014, in Pullman,
