               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W2512 SYNOPSIS: Parking Services
               reporting they located a lost/stolen parking permit being used.
               Mathews was contacted for using the lost/stolen parking pass
               illegally. Mathews warned for theft of services. NAME/DOB:

               ____OEO Sent? _____OFC/ ____CNSL SRV Sent?_____OFC/ WSU
               STUDENT: __X__YES ____NO OTHER UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On
               07/10/14 at approximately 1030 hours I was dispatched to a
               theft call at the yellow 3 parking lot next to the Washington
               Building. Parking was out with a vehicle that was using a
               reported lost/stolen parking permit. Upon arrival I found
               Parking Services employees standing around WA/396RDF a 2003
               Chevrolet Cavalier. The employee's stated they had scanned the
               Yellow 4 parking permit and it returned lost/stolen. I
               researched the vehicle and found it belonged to a Caitlin E.
               Mathews 03/02/90. I found a phone number for Mathews and called
               her. Mathews did not answer and I left a voicemail. Parking
               Services had already placed a boot on the car prior to my
               arrival. I placed my business card on Mathews car. I took
               photos of the car and the parking permit hanging off the rear
               view mirror. Parking Services and I cleared. At approximately
               1108 hours I was able to reach Mathews on her cell phone.
               Mathews agreed to meet me at her car. I returned to the Yellow
               parking lot and contacted Mathews. I told Mathews I was
               currently recording and she stated she understood. I asked
               Mathews about the parking pass she was using. Mathews said a
               friend of hers gave the parking pass to her to use. I asked
               Mathews what the name of her friend was. Mathews said she did
               not remember because she only had one class with this person. I
               told Mathews that the parking pass had been reported as stolen.
               I also explained how using a parking pass that she did not pay
               for is theft of services. Mathews became emotionally
               overwhelmed and almost fainted. Once Mathews was able to calm
               down I told her that we would talk to Parking Services and find
               out what they would like done. I offered to drive Mathews to
               Parking Services and she accepted. Once at Parking Services,
               Mathews spoke to an employee about her parking tickets related
               to the stolen pass, as I spoke with Ian Ortlieb who is the
               manager of Parking Services. Ortlieb indicated that as long as
               Mathews paid off her parking tickets they did not want to press
               charges. I returned to Mathews and told Mathews that as long as
               she paid her tickets, Parking Services did not want charges
