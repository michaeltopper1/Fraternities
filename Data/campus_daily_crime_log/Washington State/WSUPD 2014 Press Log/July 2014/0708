               black Ford Mustang WA Lic/ 956YBW was arrested for DWLS on
               7Jul14. The vehicle was parked in the driveway of 1040 NE
               Airport RD and the driver was instructed to find someone to
               move it from the driveway. Attempts were made to contact the

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 08 July 2014 at about 0943 hours,
               Lori Fuller from 1040 Terre View drive called to report a black
               Ford Mustang was left in the driveway. A local records search
               showed the that Officer Westerman had arrested the driver the
               previous night for DWLS. Dispatch attempted to contact the
               driver from the previous night to get him to get someone to
               move the vehicle. I spoke with Fuller and she said the Mustang
               was currently fine where it was parked but they would call if
               it needed to be moved. At 1335 hours, Fuller called back
               requesting the vehicle be removed from the driveway since it
               was blocking access. I attempted to call the driver again and
               the call went directly to voice mail. I impounded the vehicle
               with no hold for blocking the driveway to 1040 NE Terre View
               Drive. The vehicle was towed by Autobody Supercenter. The tow

               room. When he came back at 1530 they were gone. He described
               the shoes as Nike running shoes light grey with bright green
               accents. He stated that they cost him about $50.00. I reviewed
               the footage of the security camera, but none of the males that
               came out were holding the shoes. We told rec center staff of
               the incident and they said they would have staff keep an eye
               out for them. I told Yiwen to call me if they turn up. He said
               he would. Since Yiwen didn't have any shoes I gave him a ride
               to his residence on Karcio Court. There are no leads or

               NARRATIVE: On 070814 at approximately 1629 hours, I was
               dispatched to contact Kirill Kostyanovskiy regarding a vehicle
               collision report. Upon contact, I asked Kirill if he would be
               willing to come to the police department so I could see the
               damage to his vehicle. He told me he would. Upon arrival at the
               WSU Police Department, Kirill told me that he parked his 2005
               Volvo in the SRC parking lot at approximately 1600 hours on
               070314. When he returned at approximately 1730 hours, he
               noticed that there was damage to the rear passenger side
               quarter panel that was not there when he parked it. Kirill
               showed me three small dents in the rear passeger side near the
               gas tank. I checked the side of the car for any rub marks or
               paint transfer marks and didn't see any. The damage appeared as
               if the dents were caused by a blunt object hitting the car and
               not from another vehicle. Kirill agreed that the damage was
               most likely malicious mischief. I estimated the damage to his
               vehicle at approximately $500. I took photographs of the damage
               and provided Kirill with the case number. No suspects or leads.
               I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws
               of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 9th day of July, 2014, in Pullman,

               Insurance #009583284 7101 6 SYNOPSIS: Injury Collision-
               Alejandres (***Juvenile***) was arrested and released to his
               father Gerardo Alejandres Lopez. Charges to be forwarded for
               NVOL without ID. Alejandres was also issued a NOI for fail to
               yield the right of way causing a collision. NARRATIVE: On
               070814 at approximately 2141 hours, I was dispatched to an
               injury collision at S. Grand Avenue and SE Bishop Blvd at
               Pullman PD's request for an agency assist. Upon arrival I
               contacted all parties involved and asked if they needed medical
               attention. Everyone told me they were initially okay. Pullman
               Fire Department arrived and I asked them to check on each
               person involved in the collision for medical attention. I first
               contacted Emily Grover who told me she was driving NB on S.
               Grand Avenue at approximately 35 MPH approaching the
               intersection of SE Bishop Blvd. Gerardo Alejandres-Mancilla was
               approaching the intersection SB in his vehicle. As she entered
               the intersection, Alejandres-Mancilla turned his vehicle into
               the side of her car. I contacted Michael Sparacio who told me
               he was stopped at the intersection on SE Bishop Blvd. He told
               me that both vehicles had a green light, and as Grover
               proceeded through the intersection (NB), Alejandres-Mancilla
               made a left turn from S. Grand Avenue toward SE Bishop Blvd,
               colliding with the side of Grover's vehicle. I contacted
               Alejandres-Mancilla and asked him what happened. He told me he
               was driving SB on S. Grand Avenue. He pulled up to the
               intersection in the left turn lane. He stated he stopped and
               then proceeded when he felt it was safe and Grover's vehicle
               came out of nowhere hitting him. I asked him if he had a green
               light or a green arrow. He stated he had a green light. I
               explained to him that it is his responsibility to make sure he
               can make a left hand turn after yielding to oncoming traffic. I
               asked Alejandres-Mancilla for his driver's license and he told
               me he didn't have a driver's license. I asked him if he had any
               identification and he told me he didn't have any. I placed
               Alejandres-Mancilla under arrest for NVOL without ID, and
               handcuffed his wrists (DL). I asked Whitcom to confirm that he
               didn't have a driver's license and they did. I read him his

               Miranda rights via my department issued rights card and
               included the juvenile section of the rights. I searched him
               incident to arrest, and placed him in the back seat of my
               patrol car. I contacted Alejandres-Mancilla's father, Gerardo
               Alejandres-Lopez, who had just arrived on scene. I advised him
               what happened and he told me that Alejandres-Mancilla was not
               supposed to be driving, but Muniz was given the keys to drive
               to the store. I explained that Mancilla was going to be
               released and charges were going to be forwarded on him for NVOL
               without ID. Sgt. Griffin arrived and took photographs of both
               vehicles. He called to have both vehicles towed. Myers Auto
               Rebuild and Towing arrived for Grover's vehicle. Autobody
               Supercenter arrived and towed Gerardo's vehicle. I checked the
               damage to both vehicles and noticed approximately $5000.00
               damage to Grover's car. Both driver's side airbags had deployed
               and there was significant damage to the driver side door and
               front quarter panel. I checked Mancilla's vehicle and noticed
               that his front bumper was completely broken off and under the
               vehicle. The driver's side front headlight and quarter panel
               was completely smashed in, and it appeared that the front axle
               was broken. I estimated the damage at over $5000.00. I
               completed an NOI for Alejandro-Mancilla for failing to yield to
               oncoming traffic. I explained the NOI to him and he was
               released to his father. I advised both that charges will be
               forwarded to Whitman County Prosecutor's Office for NVOL
               without ID. At the point I released Alejandro-Mancilla, Grover
               had a friend transport her to PRH for evaluation of a sore neck
               from the collision. I responded to PRH and provided her with my
               business card and collision exchange information. Grover
               thanked me and I cleared shortly after. I completed a Sector
               Collision report and attached it to the case in Spillman. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 9th day of July, 2014, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer
