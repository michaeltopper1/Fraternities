               baseball coaching staff about an ex-student/ex-player (Jacob
               Merrick). Merrick showed up to the gyms this morning where the
               WSU Baseball team works out. Merrick was talking with players
               and a coach. Merrick mentioned he wanted to apologize to the
               team and was asking if the coaches could get the team together.

               around 20218 hrs I was asked to contact an individual regarding
               some rumors she had heard regarding an abduction which had
               occurred earlier on the WSU Campus. I reviewed the information
               from this call and noticed the reporting party, later
               identified as Barbara Benson (100162), also had concern
               regarding some information related to a previous call (14-
               W4821). I contacted Benson a short time later and answered her
               questions regarding the rumors. I went on to explain another
               call which Ofc Olmstead and I had handled earlier (See Case
               #:14-W4829) which sound similar. I explained what Olmstead and
               I had found with that case and we had not received any other
               calls similar to that from earlier. After addressing that
               incident we proceeded to discuss the welfare check which had
               been reported. She expressed her concerns regarding the lack of
               information being put out by the university and I explained the
               information she had been given was incorrect. We spoke for some
               time before I asked her if she had viewed the WSU Police page
               on Facebook.com. She told me she had not but was happy to know
               about it and that the information related to that case was
               there. We spoke for a short time longer before we concluded our
               conversation and I cleared. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of

               requested law enforcement to respond to a suspicious finding at
               a fire alarm call. A broken bong was found in a trash can near
               the activated smoke detector. No damage occurred. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 11/20/14 at
               approximately 0301 hours, Pullman Fire Department responded to
               the Terrell Library for a fire alarm. After they arrived they
               asked for an Officer to respond. Upon arrival I contacted one
               of the fire fighters who stated the smoke detector in room 20C
               had gone off. The fire fighter stated that 20C is a small study
               room and one of the doors had been propped open and smelled of
               smoke. I walked into room 20C and recognized the smokey smell
               to be flavored tobacco. The firefighter showed me the trash can
               that had broken glass in it. The broken glass appeared to be
               remnants of a glass bong. All the broken glass shards had been
               placed in the trash can prior to the fire fighters arriving.
               The smoke detector was most likely activated by someone smoking
               flavored tobacco or something similar. I took photos of the
               broken bong which were later uploaded to the files folder.
               Finding no damage to WSU property, I cleared. END OF REPORT I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 20th day of November, 2014, in Pullman,

               roommate Gill. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE 1. Christopher W. Essary
               05/18/96 Arrested/Booked Assault 4th DV 2. NARRATIVE: On
               11/20/14 at approximately 0539 hours, Sgt. Jacobson was
               dispatched to a possible domestic call. Dispatch stated a Jared
               Amar Gill 01/11/96 had called 911 wanting to know about
               consequences of an assault. Gill told dispatch that his
               roommate "socked" him but he did not want to press charges.
               Dispatch stated Gill had hung up with them prior to getting his
               location. Dispatch plotted Gill's cell phone as in the area of
               Morrow Hall. Sgt. Jacobson had me respond to Morrow to look for
               Gill. While walking through Morrow dispatch updated Sgt.
               Jacobson that Gill had called back and was willing to speak
               with an Officer. Sgt. Jacobson had me respond to Olympia Hall
               to contact Gill. While en route to Olympia Hall dispatch stated
               they were still on the phone with Gill and could hear him
               arguing with another male. Upon arrival I was walking towards
               the front doors of Olympia Hall when I saw two males walking
               through the building towards me. The males opened the door for
               me and I asked if they had called. They said yes. Both males
               were later identified as Jared A. Gill 01/11/96 and Christopher
               William Essary 05/18/96. I had Gill and Essary sit down. As we
               were walking to the area with chairs I could smell the odor of
               intoxicants coming from Gill. As soon as they sat down, Gill
               said he wanted to know some guidelines for how to deal with
               situations such as this in the future. I asked Gill what had
               happened. Gill stated he came home at 4am and Essary became mad
               at him for the late hour. Gill stated Essary woke up and told
               him to turn off the room light. Gill stated he turned off the
               room light and turned on the smaller sink light. About that
               time Essary came out of his bed and the two began to "talk
               trash" to one another. Gill stated that Essary walked up close
               to him so Gill shoved him backwards. At that point Essary
               punched Gill in the face. Gill stated "that was about it." I
               asked Essary for his side of the story. Essary stated that Gill
               came back to their room at approximately 0530 hours and turned
               on the room light. The light and Gill caused Essary to wake up.
               Essary stated he was upset because Gill had said he was going
               to be home at midnight not 0530 hours. Gill told Essary to
               "shut the hell up." Essary stated that Gill left the room and
               Essary fell back asleep. Essary woke up again to Gill banging
               loudly on the door to their room. Essary opened the door for

               Gill and got back into his bed. Essary stated that Gill began
               to "talk shit" to him. Essary told Gill that he just wanted to
               go to bed and Gill replied, "that's not going to happen."
               Essary turned on his xbox so Essary got out of bed and turned
               it off. Essary and Gill began to argue and Essary stated that
               Gill pushed him when they "got close together." Essary stated,
               "he pushed me so yeah, then I punched him in the face." Essary
               stated that Gill freaked out and called 911. Essary said he and
               Gill have been friends since elementary school and they have
               been living together since August 2014. Essary said Gill and
               him have fought before but in messing around fashion not
               violent. I asked Essary where on his body was he pushed. Essary
               stated Gill pushed him with both hands by placing them on his
               chest. Essary said when he was pushed he was pushed into the
               wall. I asked Gill when he was punched where did the punch
               land. Gill said he was hit with a closed fist in the area of
               his mouth. I asked if he was cut and Gill said no. I looked
               more closely at Gill's lips and saw there was dried blood
               around his lips and two small cuts in the middle of his lower
               lip. I asked Gill about it and Gill stated he cut his lip by
               biting it. Gill said it was a habit of his. I also noticed
               dried below and around Gill's left nostril. I asked Gill how
               that happened and Gill stated he had a nose bleed earlier in
               the day prior to the assault. I asked Gill if it hurt when he
               was punched and he stated "not really." I told Gill if I was
               hit in the face I would think it hurt. Gill then replied, "no
               like it obviously hurt." I had Essary go sit across the room
               while I spoke with Gill by himself. I asked Gill why he pushed
               Essary. Gill said it was because Essary got up in his face.
               Gill stated that Essary is a black belt in karate so he wanted
               to act first before Essary did something. I asked Gill about
               his statement and Gill stated the pushed was just to get Essary
               way from him. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this ____ day of _____________,
