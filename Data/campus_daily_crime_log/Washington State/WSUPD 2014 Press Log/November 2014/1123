    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: BRW/325 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W4901 SYNOPSIS: One male contacted for
               smoking marijuana in his dorm room, Community Duncan Dunn 387.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Andrew J. Stirling
               07/25/96 Student Conduct Poss. of Marijuana Poss. of Controlled
               Substance 2. NARRATIVE: On 11/23/14 at approximately 2230
               hours, I was dispatched to a drugs call at Community Duncan
               Dunn room 387. The RED on duty, Richard A. Wallace 07/03/90,
               stated that he could smell the odor of marijuana coming from
               room 387. Upon arrival I knocked on room 387 and Andrew James
               Stirling 07/25/96 opened the door. As soon as Andrew opened the
               door I could smell the overpowering odor of burnt marijuana
               coming from the room. I told Andrew why I was called to his
               room. I asked Andrew if he was over 18 years old and under 21
               years old. Andrew said yes. Andrew also stated that he did not
               have a medical marijuana authorization. I explained that as
               long as he was willing to turn over all his marijuana and
               smoking devices he would only be referred to student conduct.
               Andrew agreed and retrieved two small glass jars that contained
               a small amount of marijuana and one glass bong. When Andrew's
               door was open I could his desk in the corner of the room. I
               noticed a small container and a rolled up $100 dollar bill.
               Based on my training and experience I recognized the rolled up
               dollar bill as used for snorting powdered drugs. I asked Andrew
               about the small container and he showed me that it contained 6
               white pills. I asked what the pills were and he stated they
               were Ritalin. I asked Andrew if he had a prescription and he
               said no. I asked Andrew why he was snorting Ritalin. At first
               Andrew denied it but I explained that I knew what was going on
               by what I saw in his room. Andrew tried to minimize the
               situation by saying that snorting Ritalin really does not do
               anything. We walked to the outside dumpster where Andrew
               destroyed his illegal items. I explained the student conduct
               process. I also told Andrew that it was a felony for him to
               have the Ritalin without a prescription. I made it clear that
               if Andrew gets contacted again for illegal items he will be
               arrested. Andrew said he understood. END OF REPORT I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.
               Dated this 24th day of November, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.
