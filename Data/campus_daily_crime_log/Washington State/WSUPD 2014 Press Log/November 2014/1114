               Parking Garage. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On November 14, 2014 at about 1002 hours I was
               dispatched to a vehicle prowl that occurred yesterday. I
               contacted the complainant/victim, M. Patricia Pendry
               (03/21/64), by telephone as requested. Pendry told me she
               parked her vehicle, AAU9527/WA, a blue Ford Explorer, in the
               Fine Arts Parking Garage floor 1 on Thursday, November 13, 2014
               at about 1000 hours. Pendry did not lock the vehicle. She later
               returned to find a WSU Parking Ticket on her vehicle issued at
               about 1130 hours. The ticket was for not displaying a permit.
               She told me the permit was in her vehicle when she parked it
               earlier in the morning. The permit is a static sticker like
               permit that affixes to the inside of the windshield. Pendry's
               vehicle was not damaged nor was anything else taken from it.
               Her orange parking permit is valued at $528.60. Pendry did not
               know the permit number that was taken. She needed a case number
               to get a replacement permit with WSU Parking Services. There
               are no witnesses, suspects, or leads at this time. No further
               investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury

               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: Cynthia Spiller said she
               had not heard from her daughter, Alanna Spiller since September

               cult, and they had taken her out of State without her
               permission. When asked if she knew the name of the Cult,
               Cynthia believed it was called Campus Crusaders for Christ. I
               told Cynthia I would attempt to contact Alanna, and then give
               her a call back to let her know what I had learned. At about

               concerns. Alanna expressed she did not want contact with her
               mother. She also said her mother feels all Christian groups are
               cults. Alanna appears to doing fine. I did not see, or hear,
               anything that would cause concern for Alanna's well being.
               After leaving Alanna I contacted Cynthia and told her from what
               I could tell, Alanna was doing fine and I did not see, or hear,
               anything that would raise my concerns. Cynthia responded with,
               Well, I guess I'll contact the Child Protective Services up
               there, and then Cynthia hung up the phone. No further at this

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W4745 11/14/14 SYNOPSIS: Legally parked
               unoccupied vehicle was struck sometime in the past week.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               November 14, 2014 at about 1435 hours I was dispatched to a hit
               and run collision in the Blue 1 lot off of Forest Way. I
               responded to the area and contacted the complainant/victim,
               Kaileen A. Hodgerney (06/10/96) at her vehicle, 003YUN/WA.
               Hodgerney told me she last saw her vehicle on Tuesday, November
               4, 2014 at about 1500 hours. There was no damage to the vehicle
               at that time. When she went out to check on her vehicle today
               at about 1432 hours she discovered it was damaged. No note was
               left on her vehicle. The vehicle was damaged on the driver's
               side. The mirror had been broken off and was hanging by the
               wires. There were dents and scratches on the front fender. It
               looked like another vehicle struck Hodgerney's car as they were
               parking or backing out of the parking stall. Hodgerney's
               vehicle was legally parked within the marked area. I
               photographed the damage to the vehicle. I estimate damage at
               $500.00. There are no suspects, witnesses, or leads at this
               time. No further investigation. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 15th day of
               November, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               On 111414 at approximately 2143 hours I was dispatched to a
               Drugs call in Rogers Hall. I responded and spoke to RED Lee. He
               told me the odor of marijuana grew every time the door to room
               921 opened. I knocked on the door to 921 and spoke with Jose A.
               Cruz (011396), the resident of the room. He said he had friends
               visiting from out of town and he did not know what they had
               brought. No one was over 21 and no one had a medicinal
               marijuana card. I spoke to the group consisting of Ty A.
               Leyendekker (042396), Edgar A. Diaz (022796), Daniel Garzon
               (022796), Angela M. Martinez (021496), and Mauricio S.
               Palominos (032597). Leyendekker revealed he had a grinder with
               a few grams of marijuana and Diaz showed me he had dabs. I had
               them dispose of them. I warned Martinez and Cortez for their
               involvement as they were the only WSU Students. When I had
               first gone into the room the window was open and a fan was
               going. It was approximately 20 degrees Fahrenheit outside. The
               group was very cooperative and polite. I cleared. Nothing
               follows. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true

               Student Conduct/notify Diversion MIP 2. NARRATIVE: On 111414 at
               approximately 2326 hours we were dispatched to an intoxicated
               person in front of Regents Hall. Ofc. Boyd and I responded. I
               was flagged down by several people standing near a vehicle
               (WA/APY4552) at the fire lane to Scott-Coman Hall. Grant R.
               Pattison (101193) told me to watch my step as I stepped next to
               a pool of vomit. He indicated that the female in his car,
               Allison J. Gardner (091795), needed our attention. He said he
               did not know her but had brought her from a party. He could not
               get her to get out of the car. I spoke with Gardner who had
               slurred speech and the odor of intoxicants on her breath. She
               had difficulty sitting upright. She initially was not oriented,
               stating she was at the PKT's but then knew where she was.
               Gardner provided a breath sample for my PBT of .181. Dispatch
               informed me that she had a prior MIP in September. She informed
               me she was in the diversion program. Ofc. Boyd went to locate
               Gardner's roommate, Laura R. Hoffart (081896). He returned with
               Hoffart who appeared sober. Hoffart agreed to watch Gardner and
               asked for assistance getting her into Regents Hall. I helped
               get Gardner back to her room and informed her I was not going
               to forward charges but refer her to Student Conduct. I cleared.
               Nothing follows. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 15th day of November, 2014, in
