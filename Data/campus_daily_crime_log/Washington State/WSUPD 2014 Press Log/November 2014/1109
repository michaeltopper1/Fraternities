               non-injury collision on Cougar Way. I responded to the area and
               contacted 5 individuals. I asked if anyone was hurt and needed
               medical assistance. Everyone said they were all right. I spoke
               to the drivers and witness , all stated that Vehicle #1 was
               backing onto Cougar way from The Streit Hall Key when they
               struck #2 . There was a large amount of damage to the
               Chevrolet's passenger front door, but no damage to the Honda. I

               if she saw the other vehicle and she said she didn't. She said

               and failing to yield to on coming traffic. She said she would
               be more careful. I asked the driver of #2 Robert Janes if he
               saw the vehicle backing onto the street and he said he didn't
               until it was to late. I gave the two drivers the others
               information, photographed the damage to the vehicle then
               cleared the scene. I later down loaded the photos into the case

               wanted to kill himself. He was taken into protective custody

               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Jacob D. Baird (033094) Protective
               Custody Suicide Attempt 2. NARRATIVE: On 110914 at
               approximately 1936 hours, Ofc. Lambley told me that she was
               investigating a case involving a suicidal subject, Jacob Baird,
               and she believed the subject was at Martin Stadium. I responded
               to Martin Stadium and contacted two subjects sitting on the
               bleachers near the east endzone. They identified themselves as
               Jacob D. Baird and Connor Brennick. I asked Baird if he knew
               why I was contacting him and he told me he did. I asked him if
               he was having thoughts about hurting himself and he told me he
               was. I asked him to explain to me his thoughts and he told me
               he was thinking of killing himself and he was trying to decide
               how to do it. I asked him what he meant by that and he told me
               he has contemplated jumping off a building, using a knife, and
               taking pills. I asked him if he had been drinking and he told
               me he had five beers during the Seahawks football game which
               was between 1330 and 1700 hours. I asked Baird if he would be
               willing to go to Pullman Regional Hospital voluntarily, and he
               told me that he didn't really want to. I explained to him that
               he really didn't have a choice, but that I was hoping he would
               go cooperatively. He told me he would go. I told him he was in
               protective custody and that he was going to have to meet with a
               Mental Health Professional. He told me he understood. I walked
               him to my patrol car and told him that he wasn't under arrest,
               but that I was going to have to remove all weapons from his
               person. He pulled out his wallet, keys and a cell phone charger
               and handed them to me. I frisked him and didn't locate
               anything. I handcuffed (DL) and placed him in the back seat of
               my patrol car. I transported him to Pullman Regional Hospital
               where I removed the handcuffs, and completed the protective
               custody paperwork. I explained to Dr. Lightfoot what Baird had
               told me. Ofc. Lambley advised that she had found several pill
               bottles in his room and some were empty. I contacted Baird
               again and asked him if he had taken any pills and he told me he
               had taken approximately 15 Adderall pills, and numerous other
               pills. Ofc. Lambley provided the hospital staff with all the
               pill bottles she located in Baird's room. I photocopied the
               protective custody paperwork and cleared PRH. Nothing further.
