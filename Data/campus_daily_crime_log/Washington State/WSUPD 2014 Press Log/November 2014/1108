               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On November 8, 2014 at about 1317
               hours I was dispatched to a vehicle prowl that occurred at an
               unknown location on the WSU Campus. I responded to the Pullman
               Police Department lobby to contact the complainant/victim,
               Katrina D. Kelly (05/14/73). Kelly told me she parked on campus
               for the football game last Saturday, November 1, 2014 at about
               1345 hours. When she returned to her car at about 1700 hours
               she discovered it was damaged and items were taken from it. The
               passenger side window had been broken out. The cost to repair
               the window was $250.00. Kelly has already had the window
               repaired. Someone took her purse from the vehicle. The purse
               contained her wallet and contents The broken window and theft
               were not reported until today. Kelly came to the Pullman Police
               Department to pick up her purse from Coeur D Alene, ID. At an
               unknown time/date her purse was located and turned into the
               police. She told me she is still missing her wallet, Costco
               membership card, and VISA card. The cards had been in the
               wallet. She said the VISA card has been fraudulently used in
               the amount of $600.00. She has canceled the card already. Kelly
               needed to report the damage for insurance purposes. There are
               no suspects, witnesses, or leads at this time. No further
               investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 8th day of November, 2014, in

               04-04-1989) reported a damaged mirror in Goldsworthy Hall.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 11-08-
               2014 at about 1439 hrs I was dispatched to a report of a
               malicious mischief in Goldsworthy Hall, located at 1455 SE
               Stadium Way. Dispatch advised that the mirror in the 1st floor
               men's restroom had been damaged. I arrived on scene and
               contacted the resident advisor (RA) for the 1st floor. The RA
               showed me the mirror in the men's restroom. I saw that the
               mirror had been broken, and it appeared that something must
               have struck the mirror in the corner. A large section of the
               mirror had cracked and was broken. Based on information
               provided by residents, the damage occurred sometime between
               0300 hrs and 0400 hrs on 11-08-2014. I photographed the damaged
               mirror, and the photographs have been downloaded into Spillman
               and attached to this case. The damage is estimated to be
               $300.00. The RA advised that she would notify WSU Housing
               Maintenance personnel of the damage so the remaining pieces of
               the mirror could be secured and cleaned up. No suspects or lead
               were identified. No further action at this time. Olmstead/339 I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this _08__ day of __November___, 2014, in

               Warned Trespassing NARRATIVE: On 11/08/14 at approximately 2121
               hours I was driving eastbound on Grimes Way near the Grimes
               Practice Field when I noticed 4 males inside the locked up
               field. There were no lights on for the field which added to my
               belief that the people were trespassing. I drove around the
               field and found all the gates secured with locks. I walked up
               to the fence and asked the 4 to come over to me. All four did.
               I asked how they got into the field and they stated they had
               jumped the fence. I asked all 4 to collect their personal items
               and come out of the field to talk with me. Once all 4 were on
               the correct side of the fence I asked for their ID's. All four
               were identified as, Henry S. Mensing 11/13/95, Hayden M. Kays-
               Erdmann 05/14/95, Tanner C. Gill 03/26/96, and Erik C. Gotta
               07/18/94. The 4 stated they just wanted to play soccer and all
               were in athletic gear. I explained that if they have to climb
               over a fence to reach somewhere, it is not somewhere they are
               supposed to be. All 4 were very cooperative and honest with me.
               I provided the 4 with alternative options for playing soccer
               and told them they were free to go. Due to the cooperation and
               honesty of the group, I will not be referring this case to
               student conduct. END OF REPORT I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 9th day of

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Boyd/335 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W4668 SYNOPSIS: Report of a vending
               machine which was found with the glass broken and an unknown
               number of items stolen. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               2. NARRATIVE: On 11/09/14 at about 0529 hrs Dispatch advised of
               a report that the vending machine in the lobby of Northside
               Hall had been broken into and candy stolen. I responded and
               contacted the complainant, Nicholas J. Ivanoff (100394).
               Ivanoff told me he came downstairs to buy something from the
               machine and he found numerous items from the machine strewn
               about on the floor and around the lobby area. The glass front
               of the machine was broken. He collected the items that were
               laying around the lobby area and placed them on the counter at
               the front desk. I photographed the items Ivanoff located around
               the lobby as well as the vending machine. I had Dispatch
               contact the on call RED to have them respond. As I was waiting
               for them I collected the remaining items in the vending machine
               and placed them, along with the items found by Ivanoff, in a
               large garbage bag for safe keeping. I informed Michael
               Hoodless, the on call RED, of the incident when he arrived. I
               provided him with the bag of remaining items from the machine
               so hall staff could provide them to vending services when they
               came to fix the machine. I will be requesting dayshift contact
               WSU vending services to see if they can determine how much
               candy was stolen from the machine. More to follow. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.
