               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W4631 11/07/14 SYNOPSIS: Trespassing at
               WSU Children's Center playground. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On November 7, 2014 at about 0824
               hours I was dispatched to report of trespassing at the WSU
               Children's Center playground. I contacted the complainant,
               Jennifer Barajas Arroyo (05/16/95) by telephone as requested.
               Barajas Arroyo told me she is a Resident Advisor for the 7th
               floor of Rogers Hall. A resident came to her to report seeing
               people at about 0400 hours today climbing the fence at the WSU
               Children's Center playground. Barajas Arroyo did not witness
               the incident. I asked her to provide me with the contact
               information for the person who witnessed the trespassing.
               Barajas Arroyo handed her phone to a female who identified
               herself as Yvette A. Herrera (03/27/96). Herrera said at about
               0352 hours she was woken up by people outside being loud. She
               saw two (2) males and two (2) females near the fence
               surrounding the playground. Herrera witnessed an unidentified
               female climb the fence and enter the playground. The female
               then immediately climbed back over the fence and all four (4)
               individuals left the area. Herrera did not see anyone go inside
               the building or try to go inside. It is unknown why Herrera
               waited four (4) hours to report the trespassing. I went over to
               the WSU Children's Center and met with staff. I briefed them on
               the incident. They said the building was secure and nothing
               appeared to be out of the ordinary. We went to the back
               playground. Everything appeared to be in place and nothing was
               damaged. The fence surrounding the playground is about eight
               (8) to ten (10) feet tall. It is a plastic coated chain link
               fence. The gate in the back is locked. The fence was not
               damaged and there was no signs of where someone may have tried
               to climb it. The four (4) persons involved are unidentified.
               There are no suspects, witnesses, or leads at this time. No
               further investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 7th day of November,
               2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W4635 11/07/14 SYNOPSIS: Subject had
               questions regarding a sexually explicit video that he was
               involved with. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On November 7, 2014 at about 1200 hours I was
               contacted by Pullman Police Officer Crow regarding this case.
               He had been dispatched to the report and contacted the
               complainant by telephone. Officer Crow quickly determined that
               WSU Police had jurisdiction and referred the case to me. I
               responded to Waller Hall where I contacted the complainant,
               Robert LT Thomas III (02/21/95), in the basement. Thomas
               explained that he willingly participated in a sexually explicit
               webcam session with a female via Skype. This happened earlier
               in the day at Waller Hall. Thomas had questions about how the
               female can be tracked down because she claims to have recorded
               the webcam session and wants to send it to his Facebook
               friends. She is willing to accept $200.00 in lieu of sending
               out the video. Thomas did not record the sexually explicit
               webcam session. Thomas said he met this person on a website
               that "hooks people up". He then "Friended" her on Facebook and
               subsequently had a mutual webcam session with her. He told me
               her name is Cindy Jane Burns (03/16/91). He got this
               information from one of the web pages. She claims to be in
               Florida and in Kent, WA. I had Whitcom run her through both
               states and did not come back with a valid return. It appears
               the persons put a fake name and/or date of birth on line. Her
               entire profile(s) may be fake. Thomas had many questions about
               how the police could track an unknown person and ensure the
               video would not be sent to his Facebook friends. Thomas seemed
               let down and disappointed when I told him the reality of police
               resources versus those found on television in shows like CSI
               and NCIS. I told him to not pay the money and stop
               communicating with this person. I educated Thomas on the
               dangers of the Internet. Thomas thanked me for my time. No
               further investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 7th day of November,
               2014, in Pullman, Washington.

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Olmstead/339 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W4637 SYNOPSIS: Courtney M. Wiese (DOB
               09-30-1994) reported that her vehicle was damaged, and a wheel
               cover was stolen from the vehicle. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 11-07-2014 at about 1337 hrs I
               was dispatched to a report of a malicious mischief at the
               Chinook Apartments, located at 710 SE Chinook Drive. I arrived
               on scene and contacted the complainant, Courtney M. Wiese (DOB
               09-30-1994). Wiese showed me her vehicle, which was parked in
               the Chinook Apartments parking lot near the "N" building. The
               vehicle was identified as a blue, 2002 Dodge Neon (WA Lic.
               ALH0987). Wiese said on 11-06-2014 at about 1800 hrs she parked
               her vehicle in the parking lot. On 11-07-2014 at about 1315 hrs
               Wiese returned to her vehicle and determined that it was
               damaged. Wiese showed me that the driver side front door and
               trunk locks would not function, and she was not able to insert
               her key into the trunk lock. I examined the locks and noticed
               that the area around the keyhole appeared to be covered with a
               shiny, clear liquid. The liquid had solidified, and I saw where
               some of the liquid had dripped out of the trunk lock and down
               the outside of the trunk. It appeared that glue had been
               squirted into both locks. Wiese showed me that the upper,
               driver side corner of the trunk had been bent slightly upwards.
               The damage to the vehicle is estimated to be $400.00. Wiese
               showed me that the wheel cover (hubcap) had been taken from the
               driver side rear tire of her vehicle. The value of the wheel
               cover is estimated to be $20.00. Wiese checked the area around
               the parking lot, and the nearby dumpsters, but did not locate
               the missing wheel cover. Wiese also noticed that both rear
               tires on her vehicle were partially deflated, and it appears
               that someone might have let some of the air out of both tires.
               I photographed the vehicle, and the photographs were downloaded
               into Spillman and attached to this case. Wiese told me that she
               and her boyfriend have mutual friends from Newport, Washington
               that reside in the Chinook Apartments. Wiese explained that
               they all grew up together in Newport and have known each other
               for many years. Wiese explained that she was not getting along
               with these friends lately, and she suspected that they might be
               responsible for damaging her vehicle. Wiese's friends were
               identified as Alexandra L. Abercrombie (DOB 12-01-1994) and
               Galen R. Abercrombie (DOB 08-14-1992). Galen and Alexandra are
               brother and sister. Alexandra resides at Chinook Apartments
               #J48, and Galen resides in Newport, Washington. Galen was
               visiting and staying with Alexandra on 11-05-2014 and 11-06-

               2014 and returned to Newport on 11-07-2014. After speaking with
               Wiese about the situation, it was decided that she and her
               boyfriend would speak with Alexandra and Galen about the damage
               to her vehicle. I told Wiese that I would contact her tomorrow
               so we could determine if she would like me to question
               Alexandra and Galen about her damaged vehicle. Investigation
               continues. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under penalty of

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W4638 SYNOPSIS: Christopher R. Long (DOB
               09-12-1992) reported found property. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 11-07-2014 at about 1552 hrs I
               was dispatched to a report of found property at Smith Hall,
               located at 1935 NE Grimes Way. I contacted the complainant,
               Christopher R. Long (DOB 09-12-1992), on the telephone. Long
               works at WSU Purchasing in the French Administration Building
               #220. Long stated that someone found a vehicle key in Smith
               Hall and turned the key into the lost and found depository in
               French Administration #220. Long requested that the police
               department respond and take the key. I explained the WSU
               Business Policies and Procedures Manual Chapter 50.48, which
               addresses the procedures for handling lost and found property.
               I explained to Long that under these particular circumstances,
               the police department was only responsible for taking valuable
               items and money, and the key was neither. I told Long that his
               office was listed as a lost and found depository on campus and
               was responsible for disposing of the key in accordance with
               university policy. No further action at this time. Olmstead/339

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W4646 SYNOPSIS:Kayla Boner's father Brian
               Boner requested a welfare check on his daughter. They had not
               been in contact for 2 days. She was found in her room in full
               seizure. Medics transported her to PRH. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1.Bonar, Kayla N./021095 Transported To PRH 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 11-07-14 I was dispatched to a welfare check on
               Orton Hall #719. The R/P a Brian Bonar stated that his daughter
               Kayla Boner had epilepsy and it had been 2 days since they had
               spoke to her. This was very unusual. Kayla usually called every
               day. Myself and Intern Jones responded to Orton #719. When we
               got to the hallway I knew something was wrong. I could smell
               fecal matter and urine. As we approached the room the smell got
               stronger. When we got to the room I could hear, from past
               experience, what I thought was agonal breathing. I knocked
               really hard on the door and the breathing changed. I informed
               dispatch of the situation and to get medics heading to my
               location. I advised I would need another officer to assist me.
               Fearing that Kayla was in seizure and in serious need of
               medical attention I open the door. The security chain was on.
               When I yelled for Kayla to open the door her breathing changed
               again. It was becoming more and more labored. I backed up and
               kicked the door, but the chain held. I kicked the door 3 more
               times before the chain broke. The lights to the room were off
               so I turned them on. I could see a female, later identified as
               Kayla Bonar, lying on the floor. She was lying on her back with
               her legs straight out. There was a large amount of white foam
               coming out of her mouth onto the floor. She was gasping for
               every breath she took. The odor of fecal matter and urine was
               very strong. I could see that she had urinated herself. She was
               in rigid seizure. This lasted about 45 seconds. Officer
               Petlovany arrived first then Officer Boyd. Fearing that Kayla
               may have injured her neck I looked and felt her neck, but felt
               nothing out of the ordinary. Kayla started choking on the foam
               coming out of her mouth. I had Petlovany assist me in rolling
               her on her side. When we did that a large amount of white foam
               came out of her mouth and nose. She started to breath better.
               Petlovany and I noticed marks on her back. She was wearing a
               bra, a thin strapped tank top and pajama bottoms. There were
               red abrasions on her shoulders and spine where her vertebrae
               and shoulder blades stuck out. This would not have happen
               unless she had been lying on the floor for a very long time.
               While waiting for the medics Boyd found her medication. Kayla
               went in and out of seizure 7 times. Each seizure was

               approximately 45 seconds. Medics arrived one scene and
               transported Kayla to PRH. I advised dispatch to call hall staff
               and they arrived a short time later. I requested they to get
               the housing trouble shooters to clean the carpet since there
               was urine and fecal matter on it. I called Brian Boner Kayla's
               father. I advised him of what had happen. He stated that they
               had not spoken to her in two days. She has had a seizure in the
               last few months but seem to be doing better. Brian stated he
               and his wife would be calling PRH for an update. I told him if
               there was anything we could do for his family to call. He
               stated he would and we ended the call. I certify and declare

               NARRATIVE: On 110814 at approximately 0040 hours I was
               responding to Rogers Hall for another case. In front of me was
               a vehicle (WA/AIE2506) with the driver's side window down and
               it was in the low 30's. Once I got behind the car, I could
               smell the odor of marijuana. The vehicle continued into the
               Rogers Hall turn around and parked. I could smell marijuana the
               entire time I was behind the vehicle. Once the vehicle parked
               and I drove by the smell went away. I parked my car and walked
               back to the vehicle and it was still occupied. I spoke with
               Vincent E. Summerfield (051696) who had been driving the car
               and was still inside of it. I asked him why I smelled marijuana
               coming from his vehicle and he stated people had smoked in it a
               few days prior. He eventually admitted to he and his passenger,
               Young H. Nam (062096), smoking near CCN approximately 3 hours
               prior. I asked if he had anything he should not have and he
               produced a glass jar from his door containing a few grams of
               marijuana. I had him dispose of it and told both of them they
               would be referred to Student Conduct. I cleared to complete my

               on the retaining wall. We contacted the three. I asked how old
               they were and if anyone had a medicinal marijuana card. All
               three were under 21 years of age and no one had a card. I told
               all three what the rules were concerning marijuana and they
               apologized for bothering me. I told the three that I would be
               referring them to student conduct for the possession of
               marijuana. I asked the three if they would be willing to
               destroy the marijuana and water pipe. They said they would. We
               walked to the dumpster where they broke the pipe and crushed
               the marijuana up and threw the items in the dumpster. Nothing

               Jorgensen/030294 Res Burg 2. NARRATIVE: On 11/08/14 at about
               0122 hrs I heard Dispatch advise Pullman PD of a domestic
               dispute at Delta Chi fraternity. Pullman PD was busy with other
               calls and requested an agency assist. Officer Petlovany and I
               responded. I contacted the complainant, Avery P. Mottet
               (020293), who said he had been sleeping when he was woken up by
               his ex-girlfriend hitting him in the head/face. Mottet said he
               and his ex-girlfriend, Hailey R. Jorgensen (030294), broke up
               approximately a week prior. He received several angry texts
               from Jorgensen concerning Mottet taking another girl to a date
               dash. Mottet took the other girl to the date dash on 11/7/14.
               Mottet returned to his fraternity, Delta Chi, and went to bed.
               He woke up to Jorgensen hitting him in the face/head. Mottet
               was quite intoxicated as I was speaking with him. I asked if
               Jorgensen said anything to him while she was hitting him and he
               said he didn't remember. He said he did not want to get her in
               trouble and I explained Washington's domestic violence law to
               him. Mottet would not provide us with Jorgensen's phone number
               or tell us where she was living because he did not want her to
               get in trouble. I asked how she got in the building and he
               initially said he did not know. He said she did not have
               permission to be in the building. I asked if it was possible
               someone else let her in because she was his ex-girlfriend or if
               she let her self in. He said it was likely she let herself in
               because she knew the door code. I noticed Mottet had some small
               red marks near his left eye from being hit by Jorgensen.
               Officer Petlovany photographed the injuries. I provided Mottet
               with a domestic violence information packet and we cleared. I
               was able to locate Jorgensen in the WSU computer system but
               there was no local address. I called Jorgensen and left a
               message requesting she call me. I have yet to hear from
               Jorgensen. I will try to contact her again on 11/08/14. More to
               follow. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 08 day of November, 2014, in Pullman,
