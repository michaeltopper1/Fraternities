               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 11-30-
               2014 at about 0827 hrs I was dispatched to a report of lost
               property at Martin Stadium, 1775 NE Stadium Way. I contacted
               the complainant, Elizabeth A. Martin (DOB 03-30-1973), in the
               Pullman Police Department lobby. Martin reported that she lost
               her cellular telephone in Martin Stadium on 11-29-2014 between
               1930 hrs and 2230 hrs. Martin described her telephone as an
               iPhone 5 with a pink cover. Martin estimated the value of the
               telephone to be $500.00. The telephone number for her lost
               telephone is 509-592-5705. Martin stated that she remotely
               locked her telephone and configured it to display a message on
               the screen with instructions for anyone finding the telephone
               to call her mother. Martin used the Find My iPhone application
               to track her telephone to the Community-Duncan Dunn residence
               hall. I accompanied Martin to Community-Duncan Dunn, but we
               could not locate her telephone. At about 1030 hrs I was
               contacted by Martin on the telephone, and she advised that her
               lost telephone had been returned. Martin explained that someone
               had called her mother and returned the telephone. Martin stated
               that no further police assistance was needed. No further action
               at this time. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Olmstead/339 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W5012 SYNOPSIS: Carlos M. Olivares Acosta
               (DOB 11-24-1991) reported that his vehicle was damaged.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 11-30-
               2014 at about 1304 hrs I was dispatched to a report of a hit
               and run vehicle collision in the parking lot located on the
               east side of Stephenson North, 1225 SE Stadium Way. I arrived
               on scene and contacted the owner of the vehicle, Carlos M.
               Olivares Acosta (DOB 11-24-1991), and his friend, Angeline M.
               Phouksouvath (DOB 09-29-1990). Acosta reported that on 11-29-
               2014 at about 1900 hrs he parked his gray, 2006 Toyota Scion
               (WA Lic. 769XSS) in the parking lot. On 11-30-2014 at about
               1230 hrs he returned to his vehicle and discovered that it had
               been damaged. Acosta directed me to the passenger side rear
               quarter panel of the vehicle. I saw a small dent above the
               passenger side rear tire. Acosta explained that this particular
               dent was old damage and occurred with the previous owner of the
               vehicle. Acosta pointed out an area above the dent and showed
               me that the exterior surface of the vehicle was slightly
               rippled and curved outward. Acosta explained that he had never
               noticed this damage before and believed this occurred in the
               parking lot. Acosta said he thought another vehicle must have
               struck the side of his vehicle or someone fell into it and
               caused the damage. I examined the area on the vehicle that
               Acosta had identified and could feel the rippled and curved out
               portion of the quarter panel with my fingers. I noticed that
               the paint in this area was unblemished, and the dirt on the
               side of the vehicle was undisturbed. I also examined the
               positioning of the pre-existing dent on the quarter panel and
               its proximity to the curved out portion of the quarter panel.
               It was my opinion that this pre-existing dent also caused the
               surface of the quarter panel to ripple and curve, and that
               Acosta had mistakenly identified this as fresh damage. I
               explained to Acosta that there were no signs of fresh damage on
               his vehicle. I told Acosta that if something had struck the
               side of this vehicle, there would have been evidence, such as
               scratched paint or disturbed dirt on the surface, and his
               vehicle had neither. Furthermore, it appeared the pre-existing
               dent also caused the upper portion of the quarter panel to
               ripple and curve outward. Acosta disagreed with my conclusions
               and told me that he believed someone tripped and fell into the
               side of his vehicle and told me he would have noticed the
               damage long ago if it was not fresh. I explained to Acosta that
               the evidence at the scene and the damage to his vehicle did not

               number for his insurance claim. I provided Acosta with my
               business card and case number. I photographed the vehicle, and
               the photographs were downloaded into Spillman and attached to
               this case. Based on the information in this investigation, the
               original report of a hit and run collision in unfounded. No
