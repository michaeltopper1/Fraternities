               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W4796 SYNOPSIS: Christina C. Caddell (DOB
               04-23-1996) reported a fraud. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 11-17-2014 at about 1445 hrs I
               was dispatched to a report of a fraud at Stephenson East,
               located at 1265 SE Stadium Way. Dispatch advised that the
               complainant, Chirstina C. Caddell (DOB 04-23-1996), was in the
               Pullman Police Department lobby. Caddell resides at Stephenson
               East #1003. I contacted Caddell on the telephone, and she
               agreed to meet me at the WSU Police Department lobby. At about
               1505 hrs Caddell arrived at the police department, and I spoke
               with her in the interview room. Caddell stated that on 10-23-
               2014 at about 1737 hrs she received an unsolicited email
               message from someone identified only as "Christopher Gilbert".
               The originating email address for this message was identified
               as jbchristopher.gilbert@yahoo.com. The message was received at
               Caddell's email account, which was identified as
               christina.caddell@wsu.edu. The email message stated that
               Gilbert was the hiring manager for the Rock Star Energy Drink
               company and was offering an opportunity for individuals to get
               paid $400.00 per week for "wrapping" their personal vehicle in
               a Rock Star Energy Drink vinyl decal. Caddell responded to the
               email message and provided her name, address, and cellular
               telephone number. Caddell received further instruction from
               Gilbert and was told that she would be receiving a bank check
               via the Postal Service for $2190.99. The instructions said that
               Caddell was to deposit the check into her bank account. Caddell
               was told to keep $400.00 and then was given instructions to
               transfer the remaining $1790.00 via Western Union to the
               following individual: James Hobbs 5603 Hazard Street Houston,
               TX 77098 The instructions stated that this individual was the
               graphic artist for the Rock Star Energy Drink company and would
               schedule a local artist to affix the decal to her vehicle.
               Caddell said she received the bank check in the mail. The check
               appeared to be a cashiers check issued by Alaska USA Federal
               Credit Union. After depositing the check, Caddell withdrew
               $1790.00 in cash from her back account. On 11-05-2014 at about
               1300 hrs Caddell went to Safeway, located at 430 SE Bishop
               Boulevard, and transferred the money via Western Union. Caddell
               said the MTCN number for the transaction was 772-060-5303.
               Caddell stated that she banks with Chase Bank. After completing
               the money transfer, Caddell said she was contacted by Chase
               Bank and notified that her account had been frozen. Caddell
               said it appears that the bank check she received and

               subsequently deposited into her account was fraudulent. Caddell
               provided copies of the email messages she received from
               Gilbert, the letter from Chase Bank, and a copy of the
               fraudulent bank check. All these documents have been scanned,
               downloaded into Spillman, and attached to this case. Caddell
               reported that in addition to the email communication she
               received from Gilbert, she also received several text messages
               from him on her cellular telephone. Caddell said the
               originating telephone number for the text messages was 571-882-
               1084. I photographed the text messages on Caddell's telephone.
               The photographs have been downloaded into Spillman and attached
               to this case. I provided Caddell with the case number, and she
               stated that she would be contacting Chase Bank to determine
               what she needed to do next. I warned Caddell about responding
               to similar fraudulent offers in the future. I told Caddell that
               I would evaluate the information in this case for further
               investigation. I concluded my contact with Caddell, and she
               left the police department. Investigation continues.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W4797 SYNOPSIS: Dispatch advised of
               someone at the WSU Police department reporting a possible
               fraud. I talked with Trevor R. Monzingo(DOB 092894). He stated
               that he had received an e-mail offering him an at home job. The
               assignment from this job required him to cash a check to his
               account then purchase a MoneyPak card and transfer that to "the
               supplier". Monzingo thought something was wrong with this
               process and did not want to continue with the job. He attempted
               to contact the person who had sent the check in order to return
               the money. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 11/17/14 at about 1630 dispatch advised there was
               someone at the WSU Police department reporting a possible
               fraud. I contacted Monzingo, Trevor R. (DOB 092894) in the
               lobby of the department. Monzingo said he received an e-mail
               offering him a job. He looked the company up online and he
               thought it looked legitimate. Monzingo responded to the e-mail
               and took the job. He said he had to fill out an online
               application for the job and was given the job. His first
               assignment was to deposit an E-Check into his personal account
               and then withdraw the money and buy MoneyPak cards with all of
               the money minus his payment which was $300.00. He was then
               supposed to transfer the MoneyPak cards to "the supplier".
               Monzingo began to become suspicious of this process. He
               attempted to contact the person who had written the check and
               return the money. He looked up Sonya Shaheen online and attempt
               to e-mail her, and then he called her. He talk to her briefly
               and she did not know what he was talking about and the call
               ended. Monzingo attempted to call her again later and he said
               that a deputy from Collier County, Florida answered and told
               him to contact his local law enforcement agency and report what
               was going on. Monzingo also filled out a report on an online
               FBI Seattle forum about fraud. I asked Monzingo to forward all
               the e-mails he had related to this incident and he did. I told
               not to spend any of the money he had received and we would be
               in contact with him about how to return the money.

               On 11/17/14 at about 1715 hours Anh T. Ly came into the WSU
               Police department lobby to report his iPad mini stolen. He
               stated he was using his iPad mini before class started in Todd
               Hall room 133. When class started he put his iPad in his
               backpack. Ly said when he got home after class his iPad was not
               in his backpack. Ly went back to Todd room 133 and looked for
               his iPad but was unable to find it. Ly said the only time he
               was away from his backpack, during the time when he used it
               before class to when he got home, was at the end of class when
               he went up front to ask his professor a question. He said he
               had to wait a couple of minutes to talk to his professor
               because another student was asking a question. Ly said there
               was only a few students left in class when he left. He said he
               was seated in the second row of seats in the classroom. Ly
               stated he used the iPad last at about 1510 hours, he left class
               at about 1605 hours, returned home at about 1620 hours, and
               returned to Todd to look for it at about 1710. Ly attempted to
               locate his iPad with the "Find my iPad" feature and determined
               that the iPad was turned off. He said he leaves the power on.
               Ly said his iPad was white with a silver colored back. It was
               in a black case with flap cover. He also said the glass screen
               was cracked. I asked Ly to e-mail me the serial number for the
               iPad. I also asked him to send me the MAC address for his other
               devices in order to rule them out when attempt to track his

               party Francesca A. Bordonaro (DOB 012095) and she stated that
               someone had reported to her they were harassed. The person who
               was harassed Jacob T. Segner (DOB 081896) did not want to
               report the incident but had relayed the incident to Bordonaro.
               Bordonaro relayed the story to me and stated Segner was staying
               with her tonight because she felt uncomfortable going back to
               her room. I asked if Segner would like to speak to me so I
               could get her description of the incident, and Segner agreed.
               She said she was in the shower room on the third floor of
               Stephenson E Pullman, WA at about 10 pm on 11/17/14 and people
               started to throw things over the shower partition into the her
               shower area. They threw pieces of cardboard and cold water.
               They also took her towel from the hook outside of the shower
               stall she was in. Segner said nothing because she was afraid to
               instigate further harassment. She stated she stayed in the
               shower for about fifteen minutes trying to avoid any further
               harassment or contact with those harassing her. Segner said she
               did not know who was throwing things at her and she did not
               hear them to identify them either. Bordonaro stated Segner said
               one of the people involved was wearing a red baseball hat on
               backwards. Segner is a transgender male who identifies as
               female. She believes this may be why people were harassing her.
               Segner has lived on the third floor Stephenson E and states she
               has always felt uncomfortable living there as transgendered.
               She said there has been no specific incidents of harassment
               towards her but she has felt uncomfortable. After this incident
               she feels unsafe going back to her room. Bordonaro contact the
               hall director and Segner has a meeting on 11/18/14 to discuss
               moving to a different residence hall. Case pending follow up
               with Stephenson East hall director. Forward case to Office of
               Equal Opportunity. Officer Curtis Whitman WSU Police Dept. Tue

               of Marijuana NARRATIVE: On 11/17/14 at approximately 2335 hours
               I was dispatched to a drugs call at Regents Hall room 152. The
               RED on duty, Nhi Tran, was reporting the odor of marijuana
               coming from room 152. Upon arrival I knocked on the door of 152
               and Dominuque S. Thomas Mccullum 12/24/95 opened the door. As
               soon as Mccullum opened the door I could smell the odor of
               burnt marijuana coming from within the room. I asked who else
               was in the room and Sydney K. Washington 02/09/96 and Frankilin
               P. Hoerner 01/30/96 identified themselves. Mccullum and
               Washington are assigned to room 152 and Hoerner was visiting. I
               asked if everybody was over the age of 18 and under the age of
               21 and they all said yes. All three also stated they did not
               have medical marijuana cards. I told the three as long as they
               were willing to turn over all their marijuana and smoking
               devices, they would only be referred to student conduct.
               Mccullum thought about her choice for a while and decided to
               turn over the marijuana. Mccullum turned over a sandwich bag
               with approximately 3 grams of marijuana in it and a gatoraid
               bottle that had been turned into a bong. Washington also turned
               over another gatoraid bottle that had be converted into a bong.
               Mccullum, Washington, Hoerner, and I walked to the dumpster
               where the illegal items were destroyed. I explained the student
               conduct process to the three and everybody stated they
               understood. I told the three they were free to go and I cleared
               shortly thereafter. END OF REPORT I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 18th day of
