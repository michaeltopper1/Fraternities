    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: DMJ/338 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W4714 11/13/14 SYNOPSIS: Female at Valley
               Crest C9 was having mental issues, she was transported by
               ambulance to the hospital. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR#
               1. 2. NARRATIVE: On November 13, 2014 at about 0736 hours
               Pullman Fire and WSU Police were dispatched to an unknown
               medical problem at Valley Crest C9. The female patient was
               reported as acting weird. Pullman Fire Assistant Chief
               Scharnhorst, Sgt Macy, Cpl. Kuhrt and I responded from
               Hollingbery Fieldhouse as we were out with another unrelated
               medical incident. Upon our arrival the complainant and husband
               Tarek Abdussamad told us his wife was in the bedroom. I
               approached the bedroom and saw a woman pacing back and forth in
               the dark. Abdussamad said she has lost her mind. The female was
               later identified as Asma Abdulkader (11/14/83). She does not
               speak English, only Arabic. Both Abdussamad and Abdulkader are
               citizens of Libya. Abdulkader was chanting, singing, and
               screaming. She would get upset at her husband and then calm
               down. She screamed at me several times even though I was
               keeping my distance and speaking with her husband. Abdulkader
               was not acting normal. According to Adussamed she has been
               acting like this since 1700 hours yesterday, November 12, 2014
               and has been getting worse. In addition there were a set of two
               (2) year old male twins crying and fussing in the room.
               Abdussamad was unable to translate for us. He said she is
               saying things that don't make sense. We asked if there were any
               female friends or neighbors that could help translate. He said
               there were none. Cpl. Kuhrt contacted the language line and had
               them try to interpret without success. Abdussamad wanted his
               wife to go to the hospital. He assisted her out of the house
               and into the ambulance. At the request of the ambulance
               personnel I rode with Abdulkader to the hospital. As the
               ambulance began to move, Abdulkader became hysterical,
               screaming at us. She was flinging her arms and trying to get
               out of the stretcher. For her safety and the safety of the
               emergency personnel I handcuffed Abdulkader to the stretcher.
               Once restrained she calmed down until we arrived at the
               hospital. Abdulkader became upset when we asked her to move
               from the ambulance stretcher onto the hospital bed. She became
               combative and had to be physically restrained in the hospital.
               She calmed down when her husband and children arrived at the
               emergency room. We were asked to stay in the emergency room by
               hospital staff until the patient calmed down. Emergency room
               staff were eventually able to evaluate Abdulkader. Abdulkader

               earlier in the morning. I responded to the Bookie where I
               contacted Joel I. Bouchey (10/05/85), WSU Bookie Textbook
               Manager. Bouchey told me David Warner had come into the store
               just after opening around 0730 hours this morning. Warner
               entered on the ground floor near the electronics. Warner took a
               box off a display containing Urbanears black in color
               headphones. The headphones retail for $59.98. Warner walked
               around the ground floor with the headphones for sometime.
               Warner eventually went upstairs to the first floor where again
               he wandered around the store. Warner eventually made his way to
               the cafe area where he sat down. ***NOT FINISHED*** I certify

               NARRATIVE: On 11/14/14 at about 0125 hrs Dispatch advised of a
               report from a resident at Mceachern Hall that their neighbor in
               room 34 was smoking marijuana. I responded and initially could
               not smell the odor of marijuana coming from the room. I had
               been at the room previously in the week and warned the
               resident, Derek E. De La Rosa for marijuana use. I knocked on
               the door and De La Rosa answered the door. When the door opened
               I could smell the odor of burnt marijuana and could see he
               still had a plastic bag covering the smoke detector. I
               instructed De La Rosa to remove the plastic bag from the smoke
               detector. I asked him if he had been smoking marijuana in his
               room again and he said no. He said he had been smoking at a
               friends place off campus earlier. I asked if I could come look
               around in his room to make sure he had not been smoking in the
               room and had no marijuana in the room. He said I could. I
               entered the room and found a bag containing a small amount of
               marijuana in the top drawer under the mirror in the left side
               of the room as you enter. I told De La Rosa to collect all his
               marijuana and destroy it outside. He did so. I told him this
               incident would be referred to student conduct as well. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 140 day of November, 2014, in Pullman,
