               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W4507 SYNOPSIS: Mine E. Kirikihira (DOB

               telephone were taken from her residence hall room. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 11-01-2014 at
               about 0744 hrs I was dispatched to a report of a theft at
               Stephenson East, located at 1265 SE Stadium Way. I contacted
               the complainant, Mine E. Kirikihira (DOB 09-30-1994), on the
               telephone. Kirikihira resides at Stephenson East #209.
               Kirikihira stated that on 10-31-2014 at about 2330 hrs she went
               to sleep in her residence hall room. Kirikihira's laptop
               computer and cellular telephone were on the desk inside her
               room. Kirikihira stated that the door to her room was closed
               and unlocked, and she was alone inside the room. On 11-01-2014
               at about 0100 hrs Kirikihira's roommate returned to the room
               and noticed that the door to their room was ajar. At this time
               Kirikihira discovered that her cellular telephone and laptop
               computer were missing from the room. Kirikihira described her
               laptop computer and cellular telephone as: Item: laptop
               computer Make: Hewlett Packard Model: Envy M4 Serial #: unknown
               MAC Address: unknown Description: silver in color, crack above
               screen in upper left corner Value: $500.00 Item: cellular
               telephone Make: Samsung Model: Galaxy S5 Number: 973-508-5426
               Serial #: unknown MAC Address: unknown Description: white in
               color, clear case Value: $300.00 Kirikihira said she attempted
               to call her telephone, but it was apparently turned off.
               Kirikihira said she does not have any tracking applications on
               her cellular telephone. Kirikihira said she commonly uses her
               telephone and laptop computer on the WSU wireless internet
               network, and estimated she last used them on the network
               sometime on 10-31-2014. Kirikihira's WSU Network ID is:
               mine.kirikihira. Her WSU Student ID Number is: 11385412. No
               suspects or leads were identified. I will forward the
               information in this case to WSU Information Technology and
               request that they attempt to identify the MAC Addresses for the
               stolen items and check for anyone using them on the wireless
               internet network after they were stolen. Sergeant Macy advised
               that he took another theft report from the second floor of
               Stephenson East. See related case #14-W4505. No further action
               at this time. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under penalty

               hours I was contacted by Pullman Police Officer Burkett
               regarding the status of Samantha Otis. Officer Burkett briefed
               me on what has occurred since Thursday, October 30, 2014. This
               included contact with the Skagit County Sheriff's Office and a
               lock down of Seattle Pacific University. I briefed Chief
               Gardner and Assistant Chief Hansen on the case. A trespass
               admonition was issued and to be served on Otis. I determined
               she was currently detained at the King County Correctional
               Facility in Seattle. I faxed the order to the jail and followed
               up with a telephone call verifying they have received the

               1407 hrs I was working at the WSU vs USC football game. I was
               standing near section 28 in the outer concourse when I noticed
               a female, later identified as Abbigale P. Slavens (031595), who
               was having difficulty walking. She appeared to be under the age
               of 21 and was having difficulty walking, stumbling side to side
               and using the wall for balance. Slavens went into the bathroom
               and I contacted her as she exited and began walking toward the
               stands. I asked how much she had to drink and she admitted to
               having consumed a little alcohol. I could smell the odor of
               alcohol on her breath as I spoke to her. I asked how old she
               was and she said, about 21. She told me she did not have any ID
               with her and was hesitant to provide me her name, asking
               repeatedly if she could just leave. I told her I did not
               believe she was being honest. I told her I believed she was
               under 21 and that she had far more than she indicated to drink.
               Slavens admitted to being under 21 at that point and provided
               me with her name and date of birth, which was later confirmed
               through dispatch. I asked if I could check her eyes and she
               agreed. I administered a horizontal gaze nystagmus test on her
               and observed she had bloodshot and watery eyes, a lack of
               smooth pursuit in both eyes, and a distinct and sustained
               nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes. I advised Slavens
               she was under arrest for MIP exibiting and escorted her to the
               processing room. I explained to her I would be forwarding
               charges to the Whitman County Prosecutor. I read her an
               ejection notice and escorted her from the stadium. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 01 day of November, 2014, in Pullman,

               the Student Recreation Center. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On November 1, 2014 at about 1510
               hours I was dispatched to a report of a broken vehicle window.
               I called the complainant/victim, Michelle K. Miller (10/18/76)
               as requested and arranged to meet her at the vehicle. I met
               with Miller in the gray parking lot between Beasley and the
               Student Recreation Center. Miller parked her vehicle,
               V558WSU/WA, a gray 2013 GMC Yukon at about 1320 hours on this
               date. There was a vehicle parked next to her on the passenger
               side, no vehicle was parked on the driver's side. When Miller
               returned from the WSU Football game at about 1510 hours she
               discovered the window on the rear driver's side passenger door
               was broken. There was a McFlurry and a partially empty Gatorade
               bottle lying on the ground next to the vehicle. Nothing was
               taken from the vehicle and it did not appear that entry was
               made. Someone broke the entire window out, shattering it. Glass
               was throughout the rear of the vehicle and even on the driver's
               seat. No note was left. It is unknown who broke the window and
               what was used to break the window. I photographed the vehicle.
               I asked Miller to bring her vehicle up to the WSU Police
               Department so I could clean up the glass as she had to travel
               to Colfax and it was raining. I cleaned up the glass and taped
               garbage bags over the opening to prevent the rain from entering
               the vehicle. There are no suspects, witnesses or leads at this
               time. No further investigation. As I was clearing this call
               Pullman Police were dispatched across the street at the LDS
               church for a similar incident. The cases have been related. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of

               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Gaye Lynn Pierson 08/22/61 Arrested DUI
               4Z0740571 2. NARRATIVE: On November 1st, 2014 at approximately
               2109 hours I was driving northbound on Valley Road turning onto
               Orchard drive when I noticed a White Chevrolet Silverado
               traveling southbound on Orchard towards me. The corner of
               Valley and Orchard is a sharp turn and vehicles need to slow
               significantly for it. The Silverado crossed the center line and
               was half in their lane and half in my lane of travel. I had to
               come to a stop in my lane of travel to avoid a collision with
               the Silverado. As soon as the Silverado passed me I turned
               around and caught up to it at Valley Road and Merman Drive. I
               activated my emergency lights and the Silverado came to a stop
               in the middle of the intersection of Valley and Merman. After
               sitting still for approximately 5 seconds, the Silverado turned
               right onto Merman Drive and turned right again into the Valley
               Playfields parking lot. I contacted the driver, Gaye Lynn
               Pierson 08/22/61, identified myself, informed the driver I was
               recording, and explained the reason for the stop. I asked for
               Pierson's driver's license, proof of insurance, and vehicle
               registration. While standing at the driver's side window I
               could smell the odor of intoxicants coming from the truck.
               Pierson did not have her driver's license with her but provided
               me with her registration and proof of insurance. I asked
               Pierson how much she had to drink tonight. Pierson said, "not
               too much lately, earlier I did at the club." I asked Pierson
               when she stopped drinking and she said about two hours earlier.
               I asked Pierson if I could check her eyes and she stated yes. I
               performed an HGN test on Pierson as she sat in the vehicle. I
               told Pierson to follow the tip of my finger with her eyes only
               and do not move her head. During the HGN test I observed equal
               pupil size, equal tracking, lack of smooth pursuit, and
               distinct and sustained nystagmus in both eyes. Pierson's eyes
               were bloodshot and watery. I asked Pierson if she was willing
               to do some voluntary standardized field sobriety tests. Pierson
               stated she would. The tests were conducted on a level and paved
               parking lot. Pierson was wearing an outer jacket, fleece zip up
               shirt, jeans, and ugg style boots at the time of the tests. The
               parking lot was lit by street lights, patrol car spot light,
               and personal flashlight. I explained to Pierson that I would be
               evaluating her on how well she followed my instructions as well
               as how well she performed the tests. The first test I

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
               administered was the HGN test. I instructed Pierson to stand
               with her heels and toes together and keep her arms at her
               sides. I told Pierson to remain in that position while I
               administered the test. Pierson stated she understood. I told
               Pierson to follow the tip of my pen with her eyes only and not
               to move her head. I held my pen approximately 12-15 inches away
               from Pierson's head. During the test I observed, equal pupil
               size, equal tracking, and lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes.
               Several times when I moved my pen to the right side of
               Pierson's face, she would close her eyes or look at me rather
               than the pen. When asked about that Pierson said, "I was almost
               diagnosed with MS earlier so I have tendencies to have muscular
               problems." About this time Sgt. Griffin arrived on scene. The
               next test I administered was the walk and turn. I told Pierson
               to place her left foot on an imaginary line before her. I then
               instructed Pierson to place her right foot heel to toe in front
               of her left foot and keep her arms at her side. Pierson got
               into the starting position as instructed. I told Pierson to
               remain in that position as I gave further instructions. I told
               Pierson, when I tell you to begin, don't begin until I tell
               you, you will take a series of nine heel to toe steps down the
               line, with your arms at your side, looking down at your feet,
               and counting your steps out loud. Once you reach your ninth
               step leave your lead foot planted and with your rear foot take
               a series of small steps until you are facing where you came
               from and again take nine return heel to toe steps. I
               demonstrated the test for Pierson. I reminded Pierson to keep
               her arms at her side, count her steps out loud, look down at
               her feet, and do not stop the test until she had completed it.
               I asked Pierson if she understood and Pierson said she would
               like me to explain the test again. I demonstrated the test
               again and after my demonstration asked Pierson if she
               understood. Pierson said yes. Instruction Phase: Pierson
               stepped out of the starting position 3 separate times. Pierson
               also started the test as I was demonstrating once. First Nine
               Steps: Pierson missed heel to toe on every step except for step
               6. Pierson incorrectly turned by pivoting on the balls of her
               feet. Return Nine Steps: Pierson stepped off line and missed
               heel to toe on step 7. The next test I administered was the One
               Leg Stand. I instructed Pierson to stand with her heels and
               toes together and keep her arms at her side. I told Pierson to
               remain in that position while I gave her further instructions.
               I told Pierson, when I tell you to begin, don't begin until I
               tell you, you will raise either leg of your choice and raise it
               six inches off the ground. You must point your toe so the sole
               of your shoe is parallel with the ground. While pointing your
               toe, keep your arms at your side, leg straight, look down at
               your foot and count out loud, one thousand one, one thousand
               two, one thousand three, and so on until I tell you to stop. If
               at any point you put your foot down, go ahead and pick it right
               back up and continue counting where ever you left off. I
               demonstrated the test and asked Pierson if she understood and
               she stated yes. I told Pierson to begin. Pierson raised her
               right leg and began to count, "1, 2, 3, etc" not in the fashion
               as instructed. Pierson was not looking down at her foot rather

               she was looking off into the distance. I told Pierson to look
               down at her foot when Pierson said counted to 6. When I said
               this Pierson put her foot down and looked at me and asked,
               "look down?" I told her yes. Pierson then asked if I wanted her
               to "say thousand one." I asked Pierson what I had instructed
               her to do. Pierson said, "I was half paying attention." I told
               Pierson that I would explain and demonstrate the test again. I
               again explained and demonstrated the test for Pierson. After my
               demonstration I asked Pierson if she understood the directions
               and she said yes. Pierson raised her right leg and counted
               "1001." Pierson immediately lost her balance and put her foot
               down. Pierson raised it again and recounted 1001. Pierson
               counted to 1009 before again putting her foot down. Pierson
               attempted to pick her foot up two times before she could keep
               it off the ground. When Pierson got her balance back she
               started counting from the beginning at 1001. Pierson began to
               use her arms for balance and counted to 1007 and again put her
               foot down. Pierson picked up her foot and started counting from
               1001 again. At this point I stopped the test. I told Pierson
               that the last test I had for her was the PBT. I explained what
               the PBT was, that it was voluntary, and it did not replace the
               evidentiary breath test. Pierson stated she did not want to
               provide a sample. I told Pierson that she was under arrest for
               DUI and handcuffed (D/L) her. I advised Pierson of her right to
               counsel and walked Pierson over to my patrol car where she was
               searched incident to arrest. Nothing of evidentiary value was
               found. I placed Pierson in the back seat of my patrol car. I
               told Pierson that the vehicle was going to be towed and wanted
               to know if there was anything in the car she wanted out of it.
               Pierson asked for her purse and cell phone. Sgt. Griffin stayed
               with the vehicle and I transported Pierson to Pullman Police
               Department for BAC. Upon arrival I checked the Datamaster and
               found it working properly, with the RFI antenna attached, the
               mouth tube warm to the touch, and a temperature within ranges.
               At 2139 hours I checked Pierson's mouth finding no foreign
               substances. I read Pierson her Constitutional Rights at 2140
               hours. Pierson stated she understood her rights and signed she
               understood her rights and decided not to exercise her rights. I
               read Pierson the Implied Consent Warning for Breath and Pierson
               signed that it had been read to her at 2143 hours. Pierson
               stated she was willing to provide a breath sample. Pierson
               provided a breath sample of .170 at 2202 hours and another
               sample of .176 at 2205 hours. The breath test was administered
               in accordance to the methods approved by the Washington State
               Toxicologist pursuant to the Washington Administrative Code. I
               provided Pierson a copy of the following documents: Driver's
               Hearing Request, Notice of Hearing/Conditions of Release, tow
               and impound form, and the breath test document. Pierson was
               finger printed and photographed. I asked Pierson if she would
               like a ride back to the RV lot she was staying at. Pierson said
               she would. I transported Pierson to the RV lot off of Stadium
               Way. Once at the RV lot Pierson was issued Sector Citation
               4Z0740571 for RCW 46.61.502 DUI. I explained the citation and
               provided her with her copy. Pierson's vehicle was impounded by

               MIP-Possession 2. NARRATIVE: ON 11-01-14 I was sitting in my
               patrol car watching the crowd in front of Ensminger Pavilion
               when I saw a female, Later identified as Samantha Durham, walk
               over to the side of the building, pick up something, put it to
               her mouth, and tip it up as if she was drinking. She appeared
               to be under 21 years of age, so I exited my patrol car and
               walked over to her. She didn't see me walk up to her so at the
               last minute. I turned on my flashlight and this surprised her.
               Now that there was light I could clearly see that she had
               tipped up a bottle of Gin and had drank from it. I could see
               that her eyes were bloodshot and watery. I asked her what she
               was doing and she said "Nothing." I informed her that I had
               seen her drink from the bottle. I asked her to hand me the
               bottle and she did. I smelled it and it smelled like Gin. I
               told her she was under arrest and not free to leave. I did not
               hand-cuff her. I asked for her identification. She said she
               didn't have any. I asked her name and she gave it to me. I
               confirmed through dispatch that she was under 21 years of age.
               I told her I was going to be referring her to the Whitman
               County Prosecutor for MIP-Possession and to expect a letter in
               the mail. As she spoke to me I could smell the odor of
               intoxicants on her breath. I told her that she was free to
               leave the area and she did. The Bottle of Gin was empty so I
               threw it in the trash and cleared the scene. Nothing

               Emily G. Dahlberg 11/29/95 Transported to PRH Alcohol Detox 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 11/01/14 at approximately 2348 hours, I was
               dispatched to an intoxication call in the Gannon Goldsworthy
               parking lot. The reporting party was an RA who could see four
               females sitting on a curb by Goldsworthy Hall and two of the
               four were very intoxicated. Upon arrival I found all four as
               described. The two sober females were WSU Women's Transit
               drivers who stated they had just brought the two intoxicated
               females home form Cougar Crest. One of the females did not
               appear to be too intoxicated and she was crying while talking
               on her cell phone. About this time an RA came outside and
               stated she knew the female on the phone and asked if she could
               take her inside. I told the RA she could. The female on the
               phone was not identified. The second intoxicated female, later
               identified as Emily Grace Dahlberg 11/29/95, was not doing
               well. One of the Women's Transit drivers was holding Dahlberg's
               torso up so Dahlberg would not tip over while sitting. Dahlberg
               had already vomited in the Women's Transit car as well as down
               the front of her shirt. Dahlberg was so intoxicated that she
               could barely speak and was not able to keep her head up right.
               I called for medics to respond to Dahlberg. Once medics arrived
               they determined that Dahlberg needed to be detoxed for an
               alcohol overdose. It took two people to walk Dahlberg to the
               ambulance because Dahlberg could not walk under her own power.
               Once Dahlberg was loaded into the ambulance I cleared. END OF

               forwarded to the prosecutor. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE 1.
               Veniamin S Konovalchuk 06/16/95 Charges Forwarded MIP
               Exhibiting 2. NARRATIVE: On 11/02/14 at approximately 0021
               hours, Cougar Security called in stating they were out with a
               very intoxicated male in the RV lot behind the Indoor Practice
               Facility. Upon arrival I found the Security units standing near
               a RV across from Scott Place on Ferdinand's Lane. I found the
               male in question, Venuamin S. Konovalchuk 06/16/95, standing in
               between two RVs. I asked Konovalchuk what was going on and I
               noticed Konovalchuk was talking to someone on his cell phone.
               Konovalchuk turned around so I could see his face. Konovalchuk
               appeared to be well under the age of 21 and I noticed he had
               blood on his face. Konovalchuk had a stream of dried blood that
               came from his nose and ran horizontally across his cheek. It
               appeared as if Konovalchuk's nose had bleed while he was laying
               on his side. Konovalchuk also had snot smeared on his cheek. I
               asked Konovalchuk about the blood coming from his nose.
               Konovalchuk appeared to be out of it and did not answer. I
               asked Konovalchuk if nose bleeds were common for him.
               Konovalchuk still did not answer. I asked Konovalchuk to answer
               a few questions for me. I asked Konovalchuk a series of
               questions to determine his mental status. Konovalchuk answered
               all my questions correctly. As Konovalchuk spoke I could smell
               the very strong odor of intoxicants coming from his breath. I
               asked for Konovalchuk driver's license that I had seen attached
               to the back of his cell phone. Once Konovalchuk remembered that
               his ID was where I was telling him it was, Konovalchuk handed
               me his ID. Konovalchuk was confirmed to be 19 years old.
               Konovalchuk said he was staying in an RV but was confused to
               where the RV was. I started to ask Konovalchuk questions but he
               was not able to put a full sentence together. Konovalchuk would
               start his sentence and then stop halfway through and forget
               what we were talking about. I asked Konovalchuk how much he had
               to drink tonight. Konovalchuk said he had not drank anything
               since the football game. The game had ended 7 hours prior to me
               contacting Konovalchuk. I asked Konovalchuk if I could look at
               his eyes. Konovalchuk said I could. I told Konovalchuk to
               follow my pen with his eyes only and not to move his head. As
               soon as I moved the pen, Konovalchuk moved his head to follow
               the pen. Konovalchuk was not following the pen as I had
               instructed him to do. Due to Konovalchuk not following my

               directions I was only able to observe a lack of smooth pursuit.
               Konovalchuk was swaying side to side as he stood before me. I
               spent about the next 20 minutes walking Konovalchuk through the
               RV lot looking for the RV he was staying in. Due to
               Konovalchuk's intoxication level Konovalchuk was not much help.
               While walking with Konovalchuk, he was stumbling side to side
               when we walked. I stood a few feet away from Konovalchuk so he
               would not run into me. Konovalchuk was able to call his friend,
               Anatoliy A. Datskiy 02/06/92, who said he would come and pick
               up Konovalchuk. While waiting for Datskiy I told Konovalchuk
               that I would be forwarding charges MIP Exhibiting to the
               prosecutor. I explained the process to Konovalchuk. Once
               Datskiy arrived I turned Konovalchuk over to him and cleared.

               0107 I was getting off-duty and heard Cougar Security reporting
               a fight at Ensminger Pavilion. I knew we were short staffed and
               responded. I did not have my camera on me as I had downloaded
               it at the end of my shift. I was still in full uniform. I
               responded to the area with lights and siren. On scene Cougar
               Security directed me to a group I would have passed in my
               vehicle on NE Wilson Rd. I started heading in their direction
               and the group began actively fighting. I ran towards a male in
               an orange jumpsuit (later identified by Sgt. Griffin, see his
               supplement) and attempted to pull him out of the fight as he
               had gone to the ground. As I approached I shined my light on
               the group yelling "Police" and to stop fighting. As I reached
               down to get the male off the ground, Mathew C. Boesen (013195)
               pushed me aside. I went to grab a hold of him and he swatted me
               across the left side of my face with what I percieved to be the
               inner portion of his right hand along the index finger. I saw
               and heard a short female nearby yell at Boesen not to hit the
               Police. He then turned and ran. I chased after him ordering him
               to stop and get on the ground. I drew my Taser and warned him
               he would be Tased as he ran away. He stopped and went to his
               knees. We had gone approximately 35 yds towards Johnson Hall. I
               told him to get on his stomach repeatedly and he eventually
               complied. I placed him in handcuffs. I waited for Ofc.
               Westerman to arrive as backup. I read Boesen his Miranda his
               rights. He said I did not read them complelely. I read them
               again. He said he understood his rights. Boesen was informed he
               was under arrest for Assault 3rd and Obstruction. Boesen
               confirmed he was under 21. I could smell the odor of
               intoxicants on his breath. I checked his eyes and observed a
               lack of smooth pursuit and distinct and sustained nystagmus in
               both eyes. He slurred his words. Boesen refused to provide a
               breath sample for a PBT. I informed him he was also under
               arrest for MIP-Exhibiting. Ofc. Westerman informed Boesen he
               was being audio and visually recorded. We escorted Boesen to
               Ofc. Westerman's vehicle where he was searched incident to
               arrest. He was placed in the vehicle. Ofc. Westerman then
               transported him to PPD. I returned to the station and Sgt.

               approximately 0242 hours, I was dispatched to a intoxication
               call outside of Regents Hall. The reporting party called that
               an intoxicated male was standing outside of the front doors
               trying to get into the all female dorm. The reporting party
               also stated that the male kept falling into the door. Upon
               arrival I found Joshua Robert Hart 05/17/95 standing against a
               wall next to the front doors to Regents Hall. I asked Hart what
               he was doing and Hart said he was trying to go inside. I told
               Hart that Regents was an all female dorm and asked where he
               lived. Hart said, "northside." I asked Hart if he knew what
               building he was currently at and Hart said he did not know. I
               asked Hart if he had his ID with him and he said, "yeah, I
               don't think so." I asked Hart to check and he said he did not
               think he had it. I asked Hart if his ID was in his back pocket
               inside of his wallet. Hart said no. I asked Hart how old he was
               and Hart said he was 21. I believed Hart to be lying because he
               appeared to be well under the age of 21. I Hart what his last
               name was and he said it was Hart. I asked for Hart's first name
               and he said "Hart." I asked Hart if his name was "Hart Hart"
               and Hart said yes. I asked Hart for his middle name and he said
               it was Hart. I said it would be very odd to have all three of
               his names be Hart. It was clear that Hart was very intoxicated.
               I asked Hart again what his first name was and he said it was
               Joshua. This time Hart provided his full name to be "Joshua
               Hart Hart." Hart stated his date of birth was 05/17/95. While
               speaking to Hart his words were slow and deliberate. I could
               smell the very strong odor of intoxicants coming from Hart's
               breath as he spoke. When Hart answer questions he was not
               making a lot of sense because he could not put together a full
               sentence. Hart's eyes were watery and bloodshot. Hart was not
               able to stand up straight without leaning against the wall for
               support. I asked Hart if he knew where he was and he could not
               answer the question. I asked if he know who the president of
               the United States was and Hart said Obama. Hart was able to
               tell me the correct month it was but when I asked what day of
               the week it was he again said November. I asked Hart what city
               he was currently in and Hart said, "I'm sorry I'm in November."

               mental process was compromised I called medics to evaluate
               Hart. I asked Hart if he had his ID in his wallet and he said
               yes. Hart pulled out his wallet and handed me his WADL. Hart's
               WADL had the name Joshua Robert Hart 05/17/95 printed on it. I
               asked Hart what his middle name was and he said it was Robert.
               Once medics arrived the evaluated Hart and stated that he did
               not need to go to the hospital. Medics suggested Hart find a
               taxi to get him home. After speaking with Hart for several
               minutes Hart was able to remember that he lives in Campus
               Commons South. I called a taxi for Hart. I had Hart wait inside
               the lobby of Regents where it was warm. While waiting for the
               taxi to arrive I told Hart that I would be forwarding charges
               of MIP Exhibiting to the prosecutor. Hart said he understood.
               Once Hart's taxi arrived I walked him to it and cleared. END OF

               called Whitcom asking for an Officer to contact him regarding a
               guest staying in his residence room. I responded to Stephenson
               North, spoke with Burke, and cleared with no Police action
               required. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 11-02-14, Sean L. Burke (11-23-94) called Whitcom asking for
               an Officer to contact him regarding a guest staying in his
               residence room. I responded to the 9th floor of Stephenson
               North and spoke with Burke. Burke is the Resident Advisor for
               the 9th floor of Stephenson North. Burke said he had a female
               guest sleeping in his residence room who had been abandoned by
               her friends sometime over the previous evening. He said she had
               not been drinking alcohol, but was not from Pullman. I asked
               him what I could do for him from a Police perspective. He said
               he wasn't sure if anything needed to be done as she is not from
               Pullman. I advised him if he felt there was no crime or
               emergency involving the female he could allow her to remain
               sleeping in his room if he felt comfortable doing so. He said
               he felt totally comfortable just allowing her to sleep in hopes
               she would make contact with her friends upon waking up. I gave
               him my business card and asked him to call me if he needed any
               further assistance. I called Burke back on 11-02-14, at
               approximately 1020 hours to see if the female had woken up yet.
               He said she did and made contact with her friend and left very
               early this morning. Nothing further. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               2nd day of November, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.
