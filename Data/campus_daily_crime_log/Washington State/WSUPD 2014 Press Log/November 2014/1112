               Warned Poss. Marijuana NARRATIVE: On 11/13/14 at about 0118 hrs
               Dispatch advised hall staff at Stephenson South was reporting
               the odor of marijuana coming from room 631. Dispatch advised
               there was a previous contact at the room and the resident,
               Christopher J. Awwad, was warned for marijuana use. I attempted
               to contact hall staff on the phone but was unable to do so. I
               responded to the 6th floor of Stephenson South where the
               complainant, Hannah M. Mitchell, advised one of the subjects in
               the room had left. She also advised she spoke with the two
               subjects who were still in the room and they admitted to having
               marijuana in the room. I knocked on the door several times and
               Awwad answered the door. There was another male also in the
               room, later identified as Austin C. Scarff. They admitted to
               smoking marijuana in the room. They each provided me with their
               names and dates of birth. Awwad agreed to destroy the little
               bit of marijuana he had left. As we were getting on the
               elevator Awwad was complaining about how the University
               sanctions/punishment for smoking marijuana in the dorms are
               ridiculous and do nothing to help the students. He told me he
               had not intention of stopping his marijuana use and that he
               would just try to not have it in his dorm. I observed Awwad
               destroy the one small bud of marijuana he had. Nothing further.
               I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws
               of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 13 day of November, 2014, in Pullman,
