               in Perham Hall. The R/P stated that someone had damaged the
               door knob of #214 and spread food on the outside of the door. I
               responded to the area and found the owners of the room, Kyle
               Laubscher and Carson Iraola, and hall staff Kendra Morscheck. I
               could clearly see a red and light tan food product on the
               outside of the door and the floor below the door. All three
               stated that they came home from vacation the damage was there.
               The door knob had been damaged to the extent that the knob had
               to be replaced. Housing troubleshooters had already replaced
               the knob prior to my arrival. I asked Laubscher and Iraola if
               they had any idea of whom might have done the damage and they
               didn't know. I asked them if they had any problems with anybody
               and they said they hadn't. I asked when they last saw the door
               undamaged. Morscheck said that at 2100 on 11-27-14 she did a
               walk through of the hall and the damage was not there. I told
               the three if they heard any rumors about who might be
               responsible for the damage to call me. They said they would. I
               photographed the damage and later downloaded into spillman.

               for them to park their RV. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR#

               Permission Reckless Endangerment 2. NARRATIVE: On 11-28-14 I
               was dispatched to a parking problem in the Beasley RV Lot. The
               R/P a Cougar Security unit was reporting that someone had moved
               a vehicle that didn't belong to them. The vehicle had been
               towed with a tow strap. The vehicle in question was currently
               located in the southwest corner of the Beasley RV Lot. Earlier
               in the evening Cougar Security Unit Sarah Bergman had contacted
               me in my office. She was inquiring if we could tow a vehicle in
               the RV Lot. She stated that there was a RV that wanted to park
               in a spot, but it was blocked by a passanger car. I told her
               that the vehicle could only be moved by the registered owner. I
               asked her if the vehicle was legally parked and she said it
               was. I told her that since it was legally parked the WSU Police
               department could not tow or move the vehicle. She told me she
               would relay the information to the cougar security units in the
               lot. When I received the call I contacted Bergman and asked if
               it was the same vehicle we had spoke about earlier. She said it
               was. I responded to the area with Officer Petlovany and
               contacted Bergman. Upon my arrival I saw a Gold Honda Accord
               WA/Lic APY4493. It was located in the middle of the parking
               lot. It was blocking the fire lane. No fire aparatus would have
               been able to enter the parking lot with the vehicle located
               there. Bergman stated that the two of the security units, Beau
               Marshall and Gabriella Godnez, were contacted by an older male
               with grey balding hair and a grey mustache, later identified as
               Delwyn Winterfeld. He asked if the vehicle could be moved.
               There were 4 other males in the area. They told 5 males that
               the vehicle was legally parked and therefore the vehicle could
               not be towed or moved. When they left the vehicle was legally
               parked. When the Bergman told me that when she left the
               department she went to the RV Lot with per partner Nicholas
               Cruz. They found the Honda had been moved. Upon her arrival to
               the area she saw Winterfeld and the other males standing in the
               area with a yellow tow strap. They were rolling the strap up.
               Bergman called the security untis that had inquired about
               towing the vehicle if they saw anything and they seen anything.
               They told her that when they left the 5 males were still
               standing around the vehicle. I asked berman to have Marshall
               and Godinez respond to the scene. Someone had placed 4 traffic

               cones around the Honda. I noticed the pavement under the
               vehicle was wet, but the tires were not. I walked over to where
               the RV owned by Winterfeld. Under the hitch area of the Fifth
               Wheel RV there was two dry spots. It was very vlear that there
               had been two vehicles parked the recently. Marshall and Godinez
               arrived on scene and I asked them to explain what they had saw.
               They confirmed that an older balding gray haired male with a
               grey mustache had asked them to move the vehicle. The told him
               that we couldn't and left the area. I asked them to show me
               where the Honda was parked when they left. They pointed at the
               dry spot under Winterfelds RV. I asked about the other gry spot
               and they said they said that there was a blue vehicle parked
               there but the owner showed up and moved it. I asked all four
               security units they could identify Winterfeld and they said
               they could. Since is had been raining hard and was still
               raining I photographed the scene. I later downloaded the photos
               into spillman. While I was contacting the security units I had
               Offcier Petlovany contact the registered owner of the Honda. He
               contacted the owners wife a Melissa Mele. She stated that it
               was her husbands vehicle. Eric Mele is a WSU Football Coach and
               currently in Lewiston with the team. She got ahold of him and
               he told us where the extra key wasd at. They gave us permission
               to open the door with our lock picks. We open the door,
               retreived the keys, then moved the vehicle to a safe location.
               Officer Petlovany moved the vehicle. He stated that there
               didn't seem to be anything wrong with the vehicle. I gave
               Petlovany my business card. Petlovany was schduled to work the
               football game the next day and he would be working the home
               bench. I asked him togive my card to Mele and to call me with
               any defects of the vehicle. I knocked on the door of
               Winterfelds RV, but there was no answer. I left my business
               card on the door. I knocked on secveral RV's in the area, but
               no one answered. I asked Bergman to let me know if Winterfeld
               returned. She said she would. At approximately 2200 hours
               Bergman told me the lights on Winterfelds RV were on. I
               responded to the area. When I arrived I saw a balding grey
               haired male walking from behind the RV. He was latyer
               identified as Winterfeld. I introduced myself and told him why
               I was there. He told me he didn't know anything about it. I
               asked him if the Honda was there when he arrived and he said it
               wasn't. He said he arrived and just parked. I asked him if he
               contacted any security untis about the vehicle and he said he
               didn't. I asked him if he towed the vehicle out of the way and
               he said he didn't. At that time I told Winterfeld I didn't
               believe him. I told him I had witness' that told me he had
               asked cougar security units about moving the vehicle. Had been
               seen with a tow strap in his hands after the Honda had been

               his RV. He continued to deny having any involvement with the
               vehicles removal. I asked him several times why the witness'
               would positively identify him as being involved. Winterfled
               told me that the witness' were wong that it wan't him. I asked
               him if he knew who towed the vehicle and he again said he

               I was going to contact the registered owner of the Honda. If
               there was damage to the vehicle I would be charging him for it.

               who moved the vehicle to call me. I told him he would be
               getting a letter from the court and I left the area. I certify

               responded to the SRC for an intrusion alarm. We had just
               cleared the same alarm a half hour earlier. It was determined
               the loading dock door is loose and the wind was setting off the

               to prevent the alarm from continuing to activate. Sgt. Griffin
               reset the alarm and we cleared. I certify and declare under
