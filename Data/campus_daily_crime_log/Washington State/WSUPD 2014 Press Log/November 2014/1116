               shelf on the right side of the studio as we entered and said
               there was a blue electric guitar and an amplifier in the far

               09/15/95 Student Conduct Poss. of Marijuana NARRATIVE: On
               11/16/14 at approximately 2301 hours, Ofc. Stewart and I
               responded to Gannon Hall room 536 for a drugs call. The RED on
               duty, Hannah Mitchell, stated that the odor of marijuana was
               coming from room 536. Upon arrival I knocked on the door and
               Blake K. Kondo 01/05/96 opened the door. When Kondo opened the
               door I noticed a rolled up towel that had been placed to cover
               the bottom gap of the door to the floor. As soon as the door
               opened I could smell the overpowering odor of burnt marijuana
               coming from the room. I asked Kondo if anybody else was in the
               room and he said no. Kondo said the room belonged to his friend
               Nile T. Langer 09/15/95. Kondo said he was just hanging out in
               the room. I told Kondo that as long as he was willing to turn
               over all his marijuana and smoking devices he would only be
               referred to student conduct. Kondo agreed. I also asked Kondo
               to contact Langer. Kondo said Langer was in a room two doors
               down. Ofc. Stewart was able to contact Langer who returned to
               his room. I also told Langer of my offer and he said he would
               turn his illegal items over. Langer provided a pipe and
               approximately 2 grams of marijuana. Langer and Kondo both
               admitted to smoking marijuana in the room. Langer, Kondo, Ofc.
               Stewart, and I walked to the dumpster where Langer destroyed
               his illegal items. I told Langer and Kondo about the student
               conduct process as well as the laws regarding marijuana. I told
               the two they were free to go and Ofc. Stewart and I cleared.
