    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: JAK/333 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W4809 SYNOPSIS: Denise M. Yost (07-31-78)
               called Whitcom stating she believes her cell phone was stolen
               from Beasley Coliseum. She activated "Find My iPhone" and the
               person who has her phone has not called her to return her
               phone. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               11-18-14, Denise M. Yost (07-31-78), called Whitcom stating she
               and her partner, Marisa, had attended the WSU women's
               basketball game on 11-16-14. The basketball game was held at
               Beasley Coliseum. She said she placed her iPhone 4s in her
               jacket pocket while at the game. After the game she and Marisa
               went home. On the morning of 11-17-14, Yost realized her cell
               phone was missing. She remotely activated the "Find My iPhone"
               app on her missing cell phone which displays a message stating
               something to the effect of "This phone is lost. Please call
               703-346-0058". This is Marisa's phone number. Yost said she
               briefly received a "Hit" from the "Find My iPhone" app, giving
               a location of the phone. The app narrowed the phone signal down
               to the "F" building of the Columbia Apartments. She said just
               after that, she lost the signal from the phone. The "Find My
               iPhone" app is not accurate enough to pin point the location of
               a device. I; therefore, did not have enough information to
               apply for a Search Warrant. I gathered Yost's login information
               for the WSU wireless network and sent it to WSU's Information
               Technology department to see if they can locate the cell phone
               on WSU's network. Investigation continues. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               18th day of November, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.
