    Narrative: RVWD: 316 / OFC: JAK/333 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W4696 SYNOPSIS: Amanda L. Frame (05-05-
               83) stated she received a phone call from 509-335-8548 from
               someone claiming to be from the Washington State Police
               Department. They told her she owed $938.00 in back taxes.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: Amanda L.
               Frame (05-05-83) stated she received a phone call from 509-335-
               8548 from someone claiming to be from the Washington State
               Police Department. They told her she owed $938.00 in back
               taxes. Frame said when she answered her phone, a female stated
               she was from the Washington State Police Department and asked
               for her. When Frame said she was the one on the phone the woman
               transferred her to a male who called himself Officer Sabastian
               Brown. He said he worked in the Criminal Investigation
               Department. Brown said Frame owed $938.00 in back taxes and
               said she could pay them over the phone using either a debit
               card or with cash. Frame realized it was a scam, did not give
               the male any of her financial information, and hung the phone
               up. She said the odd thing was she actually did owe back taxes,
               but had paid them off earlier in the year. She said the male
               had a very strong foreign accent. I gave Frame the Police Case
               Number for the case and told her she could call us if she
               continued to receive the phone calls. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this ____ day of _____________, 2014, in

               or leads. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 111114 at approximately 1528 hours, I was dispatched to
               contact Michelle E. Okocha regarding a report of a stolen cell
               phone from the WSU Recreation Center. Upon contact, Okocha told
               me the following. On 111014 at approximately 2120 hours, she
               left her Zumba class she was teaching and walked to the Women's
               locker room with her cell phone. She thought she put it in her
               purse. A short time later, she left the WSU Rec Center and she
               drove home. When she arrived at her apartment around 2130
               hours, she realized she didn't have her phone with her. She
               returned to the SRC and searched for her phone and was unable
               to locate it. She tried calling it and nobody answered. She
               stated she uses her phone for WSU wireless access, and told me
               her NID was Michelle.Okocha. Okocha described her phone as a
               gold Apple I phone 5s valued at approximately $500.00, and she
               was going to check to see if she could locate a serial number
               for the phone. Okocha stated she has no idea who may have taken
               her phone. I emailed the WSUPD Network Security to attempt to
               track Okocha's cell phone. Case inactive pending further
               investigative leads. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 11th day of November,
               2014, in Pullman, Washington.
