               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W4866 SYNOPSIS: I stopped ID N163380 for
               speeding (38/20) on Grimes. The driver, Kevin James Crane (05-
               14-1992) had a felony warrant out of Oregon. He was arrested
               and transported to WCSO Jail. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Kevin J. Crane (05-14-1992 booked WCSO warrant
               FTA 2. NARRATIVE: On 11-21-2014 at about 0930 hours I was
               westbound on Grimes Way when I saw a small red vehicle
               eastbound at a speed that appeared faster than the 20 MPH zone
               it was in. I activated the python radar unit in my vehicle and
               saw a reading of 38 MPH in the 20 MPH zone. The reading was
               consistent with my visual observations and the audio tone was
               consistent with the speed. The vehicle speed varied between 35
               and 38 MPH. I activated my emergency lights and turned around
               to initiate a traffic stop on the vehicle. The driver saw me
               turn around and pulled into the gravel lot just east of
               McCluskey services building. I pulled in behind the vehicle, ID
               N163380. I exited my vehicle and contacted the driver who was
               identified by his Oregon Drivers license as Kevin J. Crane (05-
               14-1992) Crane admitted to going 35 mph because he had just
               dropped his child off at daycare and was running late for
               class. I told Cranes I was going to run a drivers check on him
               and if everything came back clear he would get a huge break
               today. I went back to my vehicle and ran Crane through WHITCOM.
               WHITCOM advised that Crane had a felony warrant out of Umatilla
               CO, Oregon for FTA on dangerous drugs. Myself and Officer Jones
               approached the vehicle and I talked with Crane. Crane, who
               matched the physical descriptors on the warrant, admitted to
               having been arrested in Umatilla for a drug offense. He was
               asked to step from the vehicle, handcuffed (double locked) and
               searched. I heard Jones' tell Crane he was being recorded
               Nothing of evidentiary value was found. Crane was placed in the
               rear of Jones' vehicle. The vehicle was parked by Sgt Macy in
               the blue lot across the streets Jones' transported Crane to the
               WCSO jail and read him a copy of the warrant. A copy of the
               warrant has been attached to the case. nothing further I

               DEPARTMENT CASE #:14-W4867 SYNOPSIS: Report of on going
               harassment. No criminal activity. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 11/21/14 at approximately 1000
               hours I was dispatched to the lobby of WSUPD for a harassment
               report. I met with Jeanne L. McHale in the interview room.
               McHale reported that she is being harassed and stalked by James
               Brozik. When I met with McHale I was somewhat familiar with the
               history between McHale and Brozik. McHale told me she wanted to
               officially document that Brozik was harassing her and stalking
               her. I asked McHale to explain how Brozik was harassing her.
               McHale said that Brozik has been using one of her students,
               Nick Treat, to get back at her for events that occurred over 2
               years ago. McHale said she is worried about Brozik because of
               his PTSD, which McHale made clear to me that Brozik's
               psychologist testified about during court on 11/06/14. I asked
               McHale if Brozik has ever made threats to her. McHale said
               about 2 years about Brozik yelled at her, but never threatened
               her. I asked McHale to tell me how Brozik stalks her. McHale
               said that on 10/27/14 Brozik took photos of her and Treat on
               Library Rd. I told McHale I was familiar with this as he took
               the photos to attempt to prove an order violation. McHale said
               that on 11/05/14 she and Treat were talking outside of Treat's
               vehicle parked behind Owen Science. McHale said Brozik walked
               straight towards the two of them and passed by within feet of
               them. I told McHale I was familiar with that report since I
               took it. McHale said it appears that Brozik is attempting to
               put Treat in a situation where he would violate his court
               order. I asked McHale if she thought Brozik would harm her.
               McHale said she thought that Brozik would have a third party,
               or might possibly himself "do something" to her. McHale
               explained how Brozik is enamored with the TV show Breaking Bad
               and emulates the lead character, Walter White. McHale said that
               White usually has other people do his dirty work for him on the
               show, so she would expect Brozik to do the same thing. After
               explained this McHale did say that her theory sounded "crazy",
               and I nodded my head in agreement. I explained to McHale that
               there was no criminal activity at this time. I asked McHale has
               reported her harassment and stalking to the University. McHale
               said that she has spoke with her Dean as well as the Provost. I
               asked McHale if she was aware of any action being taken by the
               University. McHale said that mediation is supposed to occur on
               12/02/14 or 12/09/14. I asked McHale if she has petitioned the
               court for her own protection order and she said that she has

               not. McHale explained that she has taken up carrying "tear gas"
               in her pocket (which she reiterated twice to me). McHale said
               she also makes certain to have her cell phone in her pocket at
               all times. I explained to McHale that she needs to call 911 if
               she ever feels threatened by Brozik. I told her that both
               Brozik and she have reported to the police that they are scared
               of the other party, but neither of them have called 911 when
               they felt threatened. I explained that both parties have always
               opted to take photos of each other and taken other steps to
               report their "fear" prior to calling the police. I told McHale
               that she should vary her routes to work to include times that
               she comes in. I told McHale to take different walking routes to
               work and to always walk in a well traveled area and to make
               note of all blue phone locations. I told McHale I would
               complete my report and forward it to the Title IX compliance
               team since she mentioned to me that she felt all of this stems
               from the fact that she is a female that is able to out perform
               a male in the workplace. I also explained to McHale that she
               could file her own complaint and I told her how to do so.
               McHale said that she has already filed a complaint with the
               Office of Equal Opportunity that was determined to be
               unfounded. I reiterated that she should petition the court for
               an order so that if there is any contact outside of the
               academic realm, it would be a crime. At this point I feel this
               case is better handled within the Chemistry Department, Human
               Resources, and the Office of Equal Opportunity. McHale said all
               of the bitterness between her and Brozik started when she was
               on a promotion panel when Brozik did not get a promotion
               approximately 2 years ago. Nothing criminal, information only.
               I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws
               of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 22nd day of November, 2014, in Pullman,

               (3) $20.00 bills in the back of the drawer under his underwear.
               One of the bills went missing about two weeks ago. When Kassa
               checked the money last night he discovered the remaining $40.00
               was gone. It is unknown exactly when the money was taken.
               According to Kassa, the money was hid in such a place where
               nobody would know it is there. The money was not secured or
               locked up. Kassa said his door is locked most of the time when
               he is gone. He does however have a roommate, Gadisa H. Margarsa
               (11/08/95), who Kassa suspects of taking the money. Kassa
               thinks his roommate took the money because he had access to it.
               Kassa and Margarsa have been having roommate living issues and
               Kassa will be relocating to another room soon. Kassa wanted me
               to make Margarsa give him his money back. There was no evidence
               that Margarsa took the money. While I was speaking with Kassa,
               Margarsa showed up at the room. I identified him by his
               driver's license. I spoke with both men about the money.
               Margarsa denies taking the money. He did admit that he leaves
               the room unlocked and has had friends over to the room.
               Margarsa showed me his wallet, it was empty, no money inside.
               We talked about the possibility of his friends taking the
               money. He said he will call them immediately. It is unknown who
               took the money. There are no suspects, witnesses or leads at
               this time. No further investigation. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               21st day of November, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               jail. IALC Student. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               Mohammed A. Alshuwaier (081588) Booked Mal Misch 3rd/Attempted
               Res Burg. 2. NARRATIVE: On 112114 at approximately 2040 hours
               we were toned out to a trespassing in progress at 603 Yakama
               Village. The suspect was a "small Arabic looking man, not very
               tall has a hood on his head". Ofc. Boyd and I responded and
               found Mohammed A. Alshuwaier (081588) staggering from the
               direction of apartment 603. He was the only person in the area
               and had a hooded jacket. I shouted "Police" and instructed him
               to stop where he was and turn away from us. He complied and
               Ofc. Boyd detained him and placed him in handcuffs. Ofc. Boyd
               informed Alshuwaier he was not under arrest but being detained.
               He was informed of his right to remain silent and the right to
               remain silent. Intern Bogard was with us and stayed with Ofc.
               Boyd as I contacted the occupant of apartment 603, Amy L. May
               (092964). May answered the door and was physically shaking and
               absolutely terrified. Her 9 year old daughter, Natalie J. Clark
               (080205), stated "I'm scared". May allowed me to come in and
               speak with her. Clark stated she had had to go into the closet
               to hide. I informed her I was recording. May recounted that her
               daughter Natalie J. Clark (080205) was home with her and looked
               out the window to see Alshuwaier arrive in front of their
               apartment in a white car. He approached the apartment and
               pounded on their door and May came down thinking Clark had done
               something. Through the door May told Alshuwaier that she did
               not know the friend he was looking for and to "Please go". She
               felt as if he was going to break down the door. He did not make
               it into the house at any point. May stated that he pounded on
               the door for approximately 10-15 minutes. He rattled the door
               handle trying to make entry. He kicked the door hard enough to
               put a dent in it ($200). The dent was approximately 4 inches
               wide. May stated the dent was new and Sgt. Griffin pointed out
               muddy foot prints on the door. He took photos of the door. She
               said Alshuwaier went to leave but then saw her in an upstairs
               window so he returned to the door and continued pounding on the
               door. May stated it was the most terrifying experience she had
               ever had and wanted us to arrest Alshuwaier. She stated "he
               knew that he did not know me" and he kept trying to get into
               the apartment. I then spoke with Ofc. Boyd who informed me we
               would need a translator to question Alshuwaier. I informed
               Alshuwaier that he was under arrest for Malicious Mischief.

               Ofc. Boyd informed me Alshuwaier was an IALC student and
               thought he was at a friend's apartment. I informed Alshuwaier
               that he was under arrest for Malicious Mischief 3rd degree for
               the damage to the door. Sgt. Griffin transported him to Pullman
               PD. I then went back to May and provided her with information
               for ATVP and protection orders. I provided her with my business
               card. I cleared and went to PPD and utilized the translator
               line via Dispatch. I stated we were being recorded. We went
               through a lengthy process to get the language line to work but
               eventually got it to work and used translator #8819. I read
               Alshuwaier his rights and made sure he knew he was under arrest
               for Malicious Mischief. He apparently responded by swearing at
               me and calling me or the translator a "whore". He explained he
               knocked on the door twice and kicked it once, but only to be
               heard over the music being played. He offered to pay for any
               door damage. Alshuwaier tried to explain he was Police in his
               country and it felt to me as if he was seeking preferential
               treatment because of that. Alshuwaier's eyes were red and
               watery. I could smell the odor of intoxicants on his breath. He
               provided a breath sample for my PBT of .169. I returned to
               Yakama Village and spoke with May again who stated there was no
               music playing at her apartment during the incident. I provided
               her with statement forms for her to complete. I then spoke with
               her neighbors, John W. Elzey (010863) and Pui C. Wo (050678).
               They confirmed that they heard the pounding intermittently for
               approximately 10 minutes and there was no loud music being
               played. I prepared a PC booking sheet and Sgt. Griffin reviewed
               it. I returned to PPD and informed Alshuwaier he was under
               arrest for Attempted Residential Burglary. I had prepared a
               translation of this via Google translate and showed it to him.
               He was transported to Whitman County Jail using a transport
               belt as he apparently had a shoulder problem. He was booked
               into jail. When I returned to WSUPD , Sgt. Griffin provided me
               with a bottle of Sky Vodka that had been Alshuwaier but could
               not go with him to jail. Intern Bogard witnessed me pour it
               out. On 112214 I met with May again to get her statement forms
               (see case file). We discussed her options with ATVP and the
               Victim's Advocate and how they could assist her in being aware
               of what was going on with the case. She requested she be
               notified of Alshuwaier being released from the jail. I later
               spoke with CO Keller at Whitman County Jail and requested they
               call May upon the release of Alshuwaier. Case closed. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.
