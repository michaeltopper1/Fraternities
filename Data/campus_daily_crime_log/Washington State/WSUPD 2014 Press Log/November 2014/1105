               North Face jackets from the Stephenson East laundry room.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               November 5, 2014 at about 0849 hours I was dispatched to a
               theft from the Stephenson East laundry room. I called the
               complainant/victim, Julia R. Spangler (09/10/95). Spangler
               reported two (2) North Face jackets taken from the laundry
               room. Spangler told me she was doing her laundry last night,
               Tuesday, November 4, 2014 at about 2200 hours. She washed her
               clothes without incident. Spangler transferred the clothes from
               the washer to the dryer. She remembers putting the jackets into
               the dryer from the washer. Spangler retrieved her dried clothes
               at about midnight on Wednesday, November 5, 2014. She did not
               discover the jackets missing until this morning at about 0700
               hours when she was looking for them. No other clothing was
               missing. The laundry room for Stephenson East is located on the
               basement level of the building. Spangler did not stay with her
               clothes the entire time the laundry was washing and drying.
               Once a person is inside the Stephenson East building they have
               access to this room. Spangler described the jackets as: Jacket
               #1 Brand: North Face Color: Black Size: Large Type: Windbreaker
               Comments: Left hand pocket has an obvious rip/tear at or near

               Orange or Red Size: Large Type: Windbreaker Value: $150.00
               Comments: None Spangler has reported the incident to hall staff
               who told her to call the police. There are no suspects,
               witnesses or leads at this time. No further investigation. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of

               James A. Brozik 05/30/67 Reporting Party Harassment 2. Nicholas
               A. Treat 05/04/86 Subject Harassment NARRATIVE: On 11/05/14 at
               approximately 1210 hours I met with James Brozik in the
               interview room of the WSUPD. I asked Brozik how I could help
               him. Brozik explained that he has had an ongoing issue with
               Nick Treat and explained he has a protection order against him.
               Brozik gave me a brief history that on 10/27/14 Treat blocked
               two entrances to his work place, which he reported to Ofc.
               Kirshner (14-W4375). Brozik explained that he took a picture of
               Treat blocking the entrance. Brozik continued to explain that
               today (11/05/14) at approximately 1150 hours he was walking to
               his vehicle which was parked in the Green 2 Lot on the south
               side of Cleveland Hall. Brozik said that he walked south along
               the sidewalk which runs between Owen Science Library and
               Stimson Hall. Brozik said that when he turned to walk to the
               parking lot (to the west), he noticed Treat and his "advocate"
               Jeanne McHale were standing outside of Treat's vehicle. Brozik
               described the vehicle to be parked at the loading dock on the
               south side of Owen Science, facing west. Brozik said that after
               he passed by he heard someone taking pictures, so he turned
               around and noticed McHale taking pictures of him. Brozik said
               at this time, Treat got back into his vehicle, made a U-turn
               and drove away. Brozik said McHale continued to take pictures
               of him. Brozik explained to me that Treat is in violation of
               his restraining order since he is having a third party take
               pictures of him which he considers to be surveillance. I told
               Brozik I would look over the orders since I was not aware of
               what they contained. Brozik explained that he has court
               tomorrow to extend the order at 1336 hours. I asked Brozik if
               he was done at WSU for the day and he said he was since he has
               to prepare for court tomorrow. Brozik said will not be coming
               to campus tomorrow either. I explained that his safety was a
               concern to me and to call 911 if he felt threatened in any way
               in the future. I provided Brozik with my business card and case
               number. I later reviewed the Anti-Harassment order which had
               already expired on 10/24/14. I reviewed the Temporary
               Protection Order, which is valid until court on 11/06/14. I
               could not find where the respondent is retrained from any third
               party taking photos of the petitioner. The order clearly states
               that the respondent can not make any attempts to keep the

               petitioner under surveillance. Since the definition of
               surveillance indicates a continued monitoring of someone, I am
               unsure if taking pictures at one period of time would violate
               the order. The order further states that the respondent must be
               300 feet away from the petitioner's office. The location Treat
               was at is approximately 315 feet away from the closest location
               of Fulmer Hall, which is where Brozik's office is located. And
               further Treat was approximately 390 feet away from Brozik's
               office. Since the behavior did not appear criminal in nature, I
               did not contact the other parties involved. This case can be
               closed unfounded. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 5th day of November,

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: ENW/328 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W4606 SYNOPSIS: Report of a student who
               had become upset during a meeting. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Mahammed, Kalid A (051586) Unable to locate 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 110514 around 1608 hrs I was asked to review the
               information in this call. Upon reviewing the information I
               noticed a student, Kalid A Mahammed (051586), had a meeting
               with the Associate Director of Student Standards and
               Accountability, later identified as Deborah E Baker (032157).
               During this meeting Mahammed expressed his displeasure with
               subjects from a previous incident in the Chemistry Department.
               He made comments to the effect that he was a dangerous person
               and when asked how replied "I'm not going to say, they'll find
               out" and that he would "save face." I contacted Baker a short
               time later and she explained the following. At approximately
               1545 hrs Baker had a meeting with Mahammed in her office.
               During this meeting Baker tried to get Mahammed to understand
               the way he was currently dealing with people was causing issues
               and not helping him in the long run. Muhammed became upset and
               during the meeting made the statements listed above in addition
               to what she believed was a statement regarding something
               following his graduation. We discussed this for some time
               during which she also mentioned Mahammed had challenged an
               instructor over some issues with a Chemistry class and asked
               him if he wanted to take it outside. The instructor was not
               threatened, but did state he would not deal with him one on one
               in the future. I asked her about Mahammed's statement following
               graduation and she explained it had concerned her and following
               the statement Mahammed stood up and started to leave the
               meeting. Baker directed him to come back and sit down and asked
               him about the comment. He told her he had a list of people he
               was going to pay back, but she wasn't on the list and wouldn't
               go further in explaining what he meant. Mahammed left a short
               time later and after speaking with Adam Jussel she contacted
               the police. We spent some time discussing this as well as
               contacting us immediately if something like this were to occur
               again. We continued with our conversation after which I told
               her I would try and contact Mahammed and speak with him.
               Following my conversation with Baker I attempted to try and
               locate Mahammed without success. I also contacted Alexandros A
               Arvanetes (030478), who had told me previously the muslim
               community in Pullman was very small. He went on to tell me he
               did not recognize the name, but would contact a few people and
               see if someone knew him. If he was able to reach him he told me

               from him and will try and locate him on 110614 when I return to

               around 1846 hrs I was requested by the Pullman Police

               I attempted to locate Horan around the area of Stadium Wy and
               Valley Rd and were unsuccessful. Macy cleared a short time
               later and Ofc Lambley of the Pullman Police Department asked me
               to meet her at 375 NW Robert St, which was listed as Horan's
               address. Upon our arrival we spoke with Horan's roommate who
               told us she had not seen her in a few hours, but she may be at
               the Paradise Brewing Company. Lambley and I cleared a short
               time later and tried to contact Horan there. We were not able
               to locate Horan and Lambley later contacted her by phone.
               According to Lambley, Horan was upset with us trying to contact
               her and added she was all right and in no need of assistance at
               this time. Upon concluding her call, Lambley and I cleared.

               Marijuana NARRATIVE: On 11/05/14 at about 2214 hrs Dispatch
               advised hall staff at Goldsworthy Hall was reporting the odor
               of marijuana coming from room 417. Dispatch also advised there
               were no previous contacts at that room. I responded and upon my
               arrival could smell a strong odor of deodorant/body spray which
               I believed was being used to mask the odor of marijuana. The
               odor was coming from room 417. I knocked on the door and a
               male, later identified as Peter N. Readdy (031496), answered
               the door. Readdy said he was one of the residents of the room
               and his roommate was not there. I could see several other
               people in the room before Readdy closed the door. I told Readdy
               I could smell the odor of marijuana coming from his room and
               explained he could require I obtain a search warrant, and if I
               did so the incident would be handled through student conduct
               and the court. I told him the other option was to retrieve all
               his paraphernalia and marijuana from the room, destroy it, and
               I would send the incident to student conduct. Readdy chose to
               retrieve his marijuana from the room. I instructed all the
               other occupants of the room to exit the room and sit in the
               hallway. They were identified as Kevin T. Kodama, Samuel A.
               Maldonado, Leelye H. Kebede, Cecilia J. Orozco, Avery L. Bird,
               and James B. Waid. After identifying them I advised them their
               names would be included in the report sent to student conduct.
               I did not ask each one if they had been smoking marijuana
               because Readdy was taking responsibility for the activity in
               his room. I walked with Readdy to the dumpsters outside the
               building where he destroyed a grinder which contained trace
               amounts of marijuana, and a cigarette case with trace amounts
               of marijuana inside. He also had a bong which was missing the
               mouthpiece. The bong did not have any marijuana remnants in it
               so I allowed him to keep that item. When I asked how he used
               the bong Readdy said "they" used a piece of tin foil,
               indicating the others in the room had also been smoking with
               him. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of
