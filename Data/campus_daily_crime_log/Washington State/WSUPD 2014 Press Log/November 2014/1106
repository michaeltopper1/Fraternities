               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W4616 11/06/14 SYNOPSIS: Theft of two (2)
               laptop computers from the CUB. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On November 6, 2014 at about 1244
               hours I was dispatched to the CUB for a report of a theft. I
               contacted the complainant, Spencer M. Desmarais (06/15/90).
               Desmarais is the Coordinator, Event Services and Operations at
               the CUB. He told me that the CUB is missing two (2) of their
               laptops. These laptops are used when groups or people rent out
               rooms in the CUB. The laptops are checked out by CUB Staff and
               subsequently checked back in when the event is over. They are
               stored in a cabinet located behind the front information desk
               where access is restricted to employees only. Desmarais
               believes the laptops were taken sometime on October 25, 2014
               during a WSU Football Kick Off event at the CUB. There are
               discrepancies in the check out/in logs. Desmarais has waited
               until today to report the items as stolen because he has been
               looking for them in the CUB and speaking with employees.
               Desmarais does not believe that a CUB employee took the
               laptops. The laptops are described as: MAKE: Dell MODEL:
               Latitude E5520 SVC TAG: JCG4YW1 WSU #: 398355 (WSU PROPERTY TAG
               APPLIED TO LAPTOP) CUB #: 2 COLOR: Black VALUE: $1300.00 MAKE:
               Dell MODEL: Latitude E5520 SVC TAG: CJBG5S1 WSU #: 395408 (WSU
               PROPERTY TAG APPLIED TO LAPTOP) CUB #: 5 COLOR: Black VALUE:
               $1300.00 According to the logs, CUB laptop #5 was checked out
               on 09/11/14 at 1554 hours and then checked back in on 09/19/14
               at 2116 hours. Desmarais believes that the laptop was not
               actually checked back in at this time due to the length of time
               the laptop was checked out for. The records also indicate that
               both CUB laptop #5 and #2 were checked out on 10/25/14 at 0937
               hours. They were never checked back in. Desmarais told me that
               he thinks the checkout of both laptops could have been an error
               by an employee unfamiliar with the checkout system. In summary
               it is unknown where the two (2) laptops are located. The CUB is
               reporting them as stolen. A WSU Police teletype form for stolen
               property has been filled out and sent to WSU Records for NCIC
               entry. In addition the information has been sent to WSU IT
               Security for WIFI/network tracking purposes. There are no
               suspects, witnesses, or leads at this time. No further
               investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 6th day of November, 2014, in

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: 316 / Macy WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W4618 SYNOPSIS: Father showed up for an
               unwanted visit by daughter. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: Darlene Sturgeon (Mother) called
               saying her ex-husband, Michael Uchuion, of 15 years, showed up
               unannounced, and un welcomed, at WSU to visit their Daughter,
               Corin Uchuion. Darlene said Michael attempted to call Corin a
               number of times last week, but Corin would not talk to him, and
               then Michael just showed up at WSU today. Learning this from
               Whitcom I called Corin before I called Darlene back to make
               sure Corin was currently ok. Talking with Corin I learned she
               has not talked with her father for over a year. She received a
               couple of calls from him last week, but she would not talk with
               him. Then today, about 1400 hours, she walks out of Kimbrough
               Hall and there he is. Both Mom and Dad live near Ventura,
               California. Corin said Michael walks up to her saying he just
               wants to talk with her. Corin, who had a couple of friends with
               her, said she told him she did not want to talk to him, and
               then she started walking away. She said he followed her a short
               distance repeating that he just wanted to talk with her. After
               a few seconds Michael quit following her. Corin told me there
               was no violent history between them, and he has never been
               aggressive towards her. She described Michael as being a tall
               and skinny Israeli with black curly hair. Today he was wearing
               a black leather jacket. I informed Corin, from what she
               described to me, Michael has not done anything illegal. She was
               told if he continues the unwanted contacts then we may be able
               to pursue Harassment charges and/or obtain a restraining order.
               Corin was informed that for now it would probably be best if
               she kept some friends nearby, and to call us immediately if
               attempts in person contact again. If we contact him we can
               explain to him what kind of trouble he can get into if he
               continues the unwanted contact attempts. Corin lives in
               Stephenson North room 625. Corin said she would call if he
               shows up again. Corin did receive a message from Michael after
               their meeting in front of Kimbrough. Corin said she believed
               Michael said he was leaving, but she was not sure he meant
               leaving campus, or the area, because the message was hard to
               understand. After talking with Corin I called Darlene, and told
               her what I had learned from Corin. I asked Darlene what Michael
               had done in the past that made her so concerned about him
               showing up at WSU. Darlene told me Michael had not spoken to
               Corin in over two years (Corin told me one year)then attempts
               to call her a couple of times last week, and then shows up at

               her school unannounced. Darlene said he would never come see
               Corin when they just lived a mile apart, so why did he fly out
               to see her now? Darlene said Michael has always erratic acting,
               but recently he's been acting like he is bipolar. Darlene did
               say Michael has never been violent towards Corin. Darlene did
               feel Michael might be angry now because he has learned neither
               of his daughters live near Ventura any more, and she has moved
               out of Ventura, leaving him by himself. Michael has remarried,
               but has no children by second wife. I explained to Darlene that
               at this time it does not appear Michael has done anything
               illegal. I told Darlene that I asked Corin to call the police
               if Michael shows up again, and/or if continues the unwanted
               phones calls after being told not too, then could look at
               pursuing Harassment charges and obtaining a restraining order.
               Darlene said she felt better, but she still might fly out to
               make sure her daughter is safe. I asked Darlene to call us if
               she has any additional concerns or if she would like us to
               check up on her daughter. Darlene said she would. No further at
               this time. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this ____ day of _____________, 2014, in

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W4619 11/06/14 SYNOPSIS: Female student
               reported a male student has been harassing her on and off
               campus by phone, text, social media and in person. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On November 6,
               2014 at about 1539 hours I was dispatched to a report of
               harassment. I called the complainant/victim, Katherine D.
               Reardon (02/09/90) as requested. Reardon told me she is a WSU
               Veterinary student. She met a WSU PhD Chemical Engineering
               student named Thomas D Jacroux (08/14/86). They met at the
               start of the academic year (August 2014), in the Pratt Study
               Lounge located in McCoy 149. She said as time passed Jacroux
               was persistent in asking her out on a date. Reardon told me she
               has a boyfriend and does not want a dating relationship with
               Jacroux. However, on October 11, 2014 Reardon was worn down by
               Jacroux's advances on her and she conceded to going to Rico's
               with him for a drink. She said she was just trying to be nice.
               While on this date Reardon told Jaxroux that she has a
               boyfriend and does not want a dating relationship with him.
               Since that time Jacroux has been texting, calling, using social
               media, and following her around campus and in Pullman.
               According to Reardon, Jacroux is having a difficult time coming
               to the realization that she is not interested in a dating
               relationship with him. This has caused Reardon to abandon her
               normal study place, the Pratt Lounge. Reardon does not feel
               safe in this location as Jacroux follows her there or waits for
               her in the Pratt Lounge. She recently moved to studying in the
               Daily Grind in downtown Pullman on Main Street. Somehow Jacroux
               found out that she studies at the Daily Grind or followed her
               to that location. He now has begun to study at that location.
               Reardon cited a recent experience this past week at the Daily
               Grind. She said on Monday, November 3, 2014 Jacroux was yelling
               at her from across the coffee house. He was yelling about not
               understanding why they can't date or be friends. Reardon said
               this made her very nervous. She called her friends to come down
               to the coffee house. The police were not called. Reardon's
               boyfriend came to the Daily Grind and spoke with Jacroux.
               According to Reardon, her boyfriend told Jacroux to stop
               contacting her. Reardon wants the police to "have heightened
               awareness" of this situation. She does not want the police to
               contact Jacroux at this time. Reardon does not know how or why
               a non veterinary student has access to the Pratt Lounge in
               McCoy Hall. She would like his access revoked. Reardon does not
               want any further contact with Jacroux. I talked with Reardon

               campus to include ATVP, OEO/Title 9 Office, and anti harassment
               court orders. She told me that she has already talked with
               OEO/Title 9 and received information on ATVP. Reardon said she
               has talked with her Academic Coordinator about the issue as
               well. The investigation continues. I certify and declare under

               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 110614 I was dispatched to a
               report of a female, later identified as Yvette A Herrera
               (032796), who appeared to have been assaulted with pepper
               spray. As I was en route I was told Herrera had actually
               sprayed herself. I contacted her at Rogers Hall in the 2nd
               floor bathroom and was told the following. Herrera explained
               she had been walking back towards Rogers Hall across the bridge
               near Wegner Hall. As she was crossing it she dropped her can of
               pepper spray, which she believed may have caused it to break.
               She picked up the can and tested it while standing on the
               bridge, which combined with the wind, blew the spray back into
               her face. Herrera continued to walk back towards Rogers Hall
               and as she neared Olympia Ave she began to feel the effects and
               couldn't see. She used her Siri application on her cell phone
               to call for help and she was escorted back to Rogers Hall where
               I found her. After a brief conversation about how to
               decontaminate from the spray I discussed the use of pepper
               spray and the potential legal issues with her. She told me she
               understood and I told her if they pain did not subside to
               contact us or seek medical attention. She told me she would and
               I cleared a short time later. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 11/06/14 at about 2143
               Dispatch advised of a possible harassment at Stephenson East. I
               called the complainant, Britteny L. Alspach, the on call hall
               director for Stephenson. Alspach told me they have had an
               ongoing issue regarding inappropriate things being written on a
               white board on the 6th floor. The white board is on the wall
               next to room 605 and belongs to the residents of that room. The
               white board is used by the entire floor and often has
               derogatory and inappropriate things written on it. Alspach told
               me the residents of the room had been talked to previously and
               were participants in what was written on the board and did not
               care. I explained to Alspach that since the residents were not
               offended and were participants in the commenting on the white
               board there was no crime provided the messages were not
               directed at any one particular person who was offended by the
               messages. Alspach sent me a photograph of the white board which
               was added to the case file. At the time of the complaint the
               white board contained a list of "Floor bonding activities"
               which included " taking shits together, watching cornhub, play
               COD zombies naked, being eskimo bros, start a cockfighting
               ring, crying, manscape each other (not gay)". At this time no
               criminal activity has occurred. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               06 day of November, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               identified as Rhonda D. Ataide-Kinnaird, responded to the add
               and agreed to lease the apartment. Guilas then found out she
               was not allowed to sublet the apartment because it was a WSU
               owned apartment. She told Ataide-Kinnaird she needed her out of
               the apartment. Atide-Kinnaird said she needed time to find
               another apartment but would pay the agreed amount for Guilas'
               apartment in the mean time. Guilas said she had been trying to
               get Atide-Kinnaird to pay her as well as get her out of the
               apartment since. Guilas' boyfriend, Todd E.C. Marshall, came to
               the apartment with her and suggested they go in to find Atide-
               Kinnard so Guilas could get the money for the apartment. They
               went into the apartment and found Ataide-Kinnaird, who
               subsequently called 911. Guilas provided me with her driver's
               license and said she was planning on talking to the apartment
               coordinators because she wanted Atide-Kinnard out of the
               apartment so she would no get in trouble with the university. I
               contacted Ataide-Kinnaird, who told me she found an add for the
               apartment sub lease, looked at the apartment, and agreed to
               rent it from Guilas. Guilas provided a sublease contract, which
               they both signed. Ataide-Kinnaird's son also signed the lease
               and witnessed the signing. The following day Guilas contacted
               Ataide-Kinnaird and told her she could not sublease the
               apartment to her and asked her to move out. Ataide-Kinnaird
               told her the sublease was already signed and she would move but
               was not going to untill she found another place to live. She
               told Guilas she would pay her the rent agreed upon until then.
               According to Ataide-Kinnaird, Guilas repeatedly called Ataide-

               Kinnaird trying to get the rent for the apartment. Ataide-
               Kinnaird believed that Guilas was unable to pay her rent and
               needed the money. Ataide-Kinnaird told Guilas she would give
               her a check the following day (11/07/14). Ataide-Kinnaird was
               sleeping in the apartment when she was woke by Guilas and
               Marshall entering the apartment. She was very frightened
               because she did not know who Marshall was and he refused to
               leave untill officers arrived on scene. Ataide-Kinnaird said
               she did not necessarily want charges against Marshall and
               Guilas. She wanted to make sure they no longer had keys to the
               apartment and also wanted it made clear they were not to come
               to the apartment or enter the apartment. I spoke to Guilas
               again and explained to her that since she sublet the apartment
               she no longer had a right to be in the apartment, even if she
               was not supposed to have sublet the apartment. I told Guilas if
               she entered the apartment again without permission she would be
               charged with trespassing. Guilas turned over her keys to the
               apartment to the apartment coordinators, who were outside with
               us at this point. I suggested Guilas go to the WSU housing
               office first thing in the morning and explain what happened and
               try to work out a solution with them. She asked how she could
               contact Ataide-Kinnaird to get the check for the apartment. I
               arranged with Ataide-Kinnaird that she would text Guilas the
               following day to set up a meeting so she could give Guilas a
               check for the agreed upon rent. I also suggested to Ataide-
               Kinnaird that she go to WSU housing in the morning and explain
               the situation so she could try to figure out a solution to the
               situation. She said she would do so and that she was willing to
               move out as soon as she was able to find another apartment.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 07 day of November, 2014, in

               NARRATIVE: On 110614 around 2312 hrs I was dispatched to a
               report of the odor of marijuana coming from room 412 of
               Goldsworthy Hall. Due to another call I was unable to respond
               until 2347 hrs. Upon my arrival I noticed the odor of burnt
               marijuana in the hallway leading towards room 412. Upon
               reaching the door I could hear movement from within the room
               and after smelling around the doorway I detected a faint odor
               of marijuana coming from within. I knocked on the door, which
               was answered by an individual, later identified as Dario
               Prudente (112695). As I explained to Prudente why I was there I
               could detect the faint odor of marijuana and asked him if I
               could speak with him. He agreed and stepped out into the
               hallway and we went into the lounge to speak where he told me
               the following. Prudente told me he had been with some friends
               who had been smoking marijuana. He denied having smoked any
               marijuana and went on to tell me they all came back to his room
               before they eventually left. I confirmed he had no marijuana in
               the room and explained the federal guidelines regarding the
               possession of marijuana. Prudente told me he understood and I
               cleared a short time later. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               7th day of November, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               broken out of a vending machine on the 12th floor of Rogers
               Hall. No suspects or leads. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 11/07/14 at about 0128 hrs
               Dispatch advised of a report from hall staff at Rogers Hall
               that the glass was broken out of a vending machine on the 12th
               floor. I responded and contacted the RA on scene, Shanelle D.
               Cunningham, who directed me to the vending machine. The glass
               on the machine was completely broken out, with a couple of the
               coils from inside the machine sticking out. There was a
               Snickers bar laying on the ground several feet from the
               machine. It appeared some, but not much, of the candy had been
               stolen. My best estimate is that at most $30. Cunningham told
               me she was advised of the damage by a resident, Daine T.
               Feitosa. I asked Cunningham to find Feitosa so I could speak
               with her. Feitosa told me at about 0120 hrs she was coming to
               the 12th floor to get some ice from the ice machine. When she
               arrived to the lounge area one of the doors at the end of the
               room was closing, as if someone had just left the room. As she
               rounded the corner to the area where the vending machines are
               she found the candy machine with the glass broken out and a
               snickers bar laying on the floor. She got her ice from the
               machine and as she was leaving the lounge area noticed two
               males who had entered the room. They were described as being
               white males, 5'10" -6'0" wearing black t-shirts. One of them
               had short blonde hair and a goatee. She did not remember what
               the other looked like. Feitosa did not see the males anywhere
               near the vending machine and has no idea if they were involved.
               She had never seen the males before and did not know who they
               were. At this time I have no suspects or leads. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 07 day of November, 2014, in Pullman,
