               responded to the building at the request of WSU Environmental
               Health and Services (EHS). Personnel from WSU EHS also
               responded. The bat has been in the buildings for about a week
               and has evaded capture. The bat was eventually caught on the

               from WSU. The bat was removed from the building. I was told the
               bat will be evaluated and treated for dehydration. No further
               investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 26th day of November, 2014, in

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Edwards/330 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: SYNOPSIS: Report of a lost Surface Pro
               Tablet, last seen sometime in 2013. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 11-26-14 at about 1500 hours I
               was given an Inventory Control Report sent to WSUPD from
               Terrell Library. Barbara Stone, IT Systems Specialist for the
               Libraries, was requesting a case number for a Microsoft Surface
               Pro tablet that has gone missing. The tablet was last seen in
               2013. Attached to the Inventory Control Report there was a
               letter from Stone which desrcribed the circumstances
               surrounding the missing tablet. The last known person to have
               the table was Eileen Brady, an employee at Owen Science
               Library. Brady said that when she was done with the tablet she
               sent it back to Terrell library through campus mail. She
               thought she sent the tablet to Lorena O'English "months ago".
               O'English never received the tablet, nor did anybody else at
               Terrell Library. A copy of the Inventory Control Report and the
               letter are attached to the Spillman Files. I provided Stone
               with the case number. Based on the amount of time that has
               passed since the device was last seen, no further
               investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 1st day of December, 2014, in
               Pullman, Washington. _______________________________________
