               extra patrols in the Yakima Apartment area. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: Tyler Stumps is
               requesting extra patrols in the area of Yakima Village due to
               the situation (14-W4886) last week. After talking about, and
               discussing, the event last week Stumps seemed to feel better,
               but still wanted extra patrols in the area. I informed Stumps I
               would pass this information along to the other shifts so extra
               patrols would be performed. No further. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               ____ day of _____________, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.
