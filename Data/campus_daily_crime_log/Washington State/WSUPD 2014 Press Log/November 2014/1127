               2. NARRATIVE: On November 27, 2014 at about 1448 hours Pullman
               Police were dispatched to a verbal domestic dispute on the 600
               block of Taylor Street. Pullman Police requested an agency
               assist as they only had one officer available to respond to the
               call. I responded to the area. Pullman Police Officer Heroff
               and I contacted a male and female on the sidewalk outside of
               635 SE Taylor Street. I spoke with the female who told me they
               were just arguing. She said there was not a physical
               altercation and she feel safe. The female seemed upset that the
               police were called. She did not know who called. Her vehicle
               was parked in the middle of street. Officer Heroff contacted
               the male and later contacted the female. Officer Heroff
               determined that this incident was verbal only and we cleared
               the scene. No further investigation, assistance provided. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 28th day of November, 2014, in Pullman,

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: dd/329 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W4940 SYNOPSIS: Report of Moscow PD in
               pursuit of a vehicle heading back to Pullman which had rolled
               on SR 270 near James Toyota. WSU Officers responded until WSP
               and WCSO could arrive on scene. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 11-27-14 at approximately 2051
               hours, I heard Whitcom advise local agencies of an erratically
               driven vehicle traveling in excessive speeds on SR 270 headed
               towards Moscow from James Toyota. The vehicle was described as
               passing other vehicles in the center lane and turning off its
               lights as it did so. They also described it going at speeds
               near 90 mph. At the time I heard there were no WSP or WCSO
               units in the area. Due to the vehicle traveling to Moscow, I
               only listened to the reports. The description of the vehicle
               matched the description of vehicle reported the night before
               leaving Zeppos which was possibly a DUI and the subject was
               reported to be aggressive. There have been two other possible
               calls regarding a report of a similar description of vehicle
               driving erratically around the area. A few minutes later,
               Whitcom advised Moscow PD was now in pursuit of the vehicle
               which was on SR 270 headed back towards Pullman. Ofc. Welter
               and I went to our vehicles to monitor traffic on campus. As I
               was driving down Stadium Way near Grimes Way, Whitcom advised
               the vehicle had crashed and rolled near James Toyota. Knowing
               there were no WSP or WCSO units in the area, Ofc. Welter and I
               responded to the scene until other units could respond. I
               advised Whitcom we would be enroute until we were advised
               otherwise. When I arrived on scene, I could see several Moscow
               PD units on scene. I also observed the vehicle was well off the
               roadway and appeared to have rolled several times. It was
               smoking from the front engine area and was on its wheels. I
               could also see three or four Ofc's up in the hill in the field
               with a subject on the ground. I relayed information to Whitcom
               and climbed up the field. The driver, identified as Mohammed
               Alshuwaier, was laying on the ground. He had what appeared to
               be a laceration to the side of his head and across his left eye
               brow. He also appeared to be bleeding possibly from the mouth.
               I could smell an extremely overwhelming odor of intoxicants
               emitting from his breath when he spoke. I advised him to lay as
               still as possible. I asked him where he was hurt and he said
               his neck and back. I could see he also had bruising down his
               neck and across his hip. I remained with him until medics
               arrived on scene and took over care. I continued to stay on
               scene until I was advised by WSP and WCSO I could clear. Ofc.
