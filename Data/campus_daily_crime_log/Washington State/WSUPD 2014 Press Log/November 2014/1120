               a male in the lobby of Olympia Ave Housing. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On November 20, 2014 at
               about 0923 hours I was dispatched to a welfare check on an male
               in the lobby of Olympia Ave Housing. The Residential Education
               Director called as she was concerned about one of her
               residents, Jared A. Gill (01/11/96). Gill was asleep on a couch
               in the lobby. Sgt. Larsen and I responded to the building. I
               had contacted Gill with Officer Westerman earlier in the
               morning at about 0619 hours. Gill was told to go to his room
               and said he had his key card for access. I attempted to wake
               Gill by talking to him. That was unsuccessful. Gill eventually
               awoke to a sternum rub. He was oriented to his location. I
               could smell the odor of alcohol coming from his breath as he
               spoke. Gill said he was locked out of his room and the key card
               kiosk was broken so he couldn't get back into his room. Sgt.
               Larsen and I escorted Gill to his room, 418, and I opened the
               door for him using my key card. He verified his identification
               by showing us his State of Washington driver's license. The
               license was on his desk. Assistance was provided, no further
               investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 20th day of November, 2014, in

               dropped into the storm drain on College Ave directly in front
               of the steps leading up to the main doors of Heald Hall. Two

               rake. The keys were returned to the reporting party. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 112014 at about
               1048hrs, Colleen Chalmers called to say that she needed some
               assistance locating her keys in a storm drain on College Avenue
               just in front of the main doors to Heald Hall. She said that
               last night around 2100hrs she dropped her keys and they fell in
               the storm drain. Officer Jones and I located the drain and took
               the grate off of the top. The drain had about 12 inches of
               water in the bottom and we had to reach down about three feet
               in order to touch the water. We were able to obtain a small
               garden rake from a WSU Grounds employee and eventually hooked
               onto the keyring. The keyring was returned to Chalmers. MFL/313

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W4845 SYNOPSIS: Officers responded to
               Vogel Hall and contacted Betty J. Blatner (04-04-57) near room
               136. She was acting very manic, but not a danger to herself or
               others. She was eventually escorted out of the building.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 11-20-
               14, Officer Jones and I responded to Vogel Hall near room 136.
               We contacted Betty J. Blatner (04-04-57). Blatner was in a
               extremely manic state and talked non stop about very random
               things. Her co-workers and supervisor were concerned for her
               well being. She said she had an appointment with WSU Human
               Resources at 1200 hours and an appointment with DR. Simpson at
               1400 hours. The City of Pullman Fire Medics responded to
               evaluate Blatner. They said they didn't have any medical reason
               to force her to go to Pullman Regional Hospital. I did not take
               her into Protective Custody as she was not a threat to herself
               or others. After speaking with Blatner for approximately 1.5
               hour, Officer Jones and I escorted her from the building. She
               said she was going to the Red Sage Cafe and then to her
               Doctor's appointment. Officer Jones was wearing a body camera.
               He recorded the event and downloaded it onto the WSU Police
               Computer System. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 20th day of

               NARRATIVE: On November 20, 2014 at about 1332 hours I was
               dispatched to a citizen assist at Gannon Hall. I contacted the
               complainant, Dylan C. Blair (10/04/96) by telephone as
               requested. Blair said his key broke off in his bike lock and
               needed assistance with unlocking his bike. He has the broken
               portion of the key on his key ring. I responded to Gannon Hall
               where I met Blair at his bicycle. Blair told me he called WSU
               Housing but they were not able to assist him. I verified
               Blair's identification and he showed me the broken key. He
               matched it up to the key stuck in the bike lock. I provided
               Blair with bolt cutters and watched as he cut his yellow bike
               lock cable. He thanked me for the assistance. No further
               investigation I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 20th day of November, 2014, in

               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On November 20, 2014 at about
               1345 hours I was dispatched to a lost property report. I
               contacted the victim, Wedad K. Alsiyabi (03/07/93) in the WSU
               Police Department lobby. Alsiyabi told me she lost her wallet
               sometime on Friday, November 14, 2014. She does not know where
               she may have lost it. Alsiyabi lives in the Providence Court
               apartments. She told me she went to Orton Hall but does not
               remember taking her wallet there. Alsiyabi described the wallet
               as being light green in color. The wallet is valued at $20.00.
               The wallet contained the following: Health insurance card
               Cougar Card Visa credit card Alsiyabi's Oman Driver's License
               There was no cash in the wallet. Alsiyabi has not cancelled her
               credit card nor has she checked for any fraudulent charges made
               on the card. I gave Alsiyabi the case number and advised her to
               cancel the credit card. There are no suspects, witnesses, or
               leads at this time. No further investigation. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of

               parents for her and give them the hospital phone number.
