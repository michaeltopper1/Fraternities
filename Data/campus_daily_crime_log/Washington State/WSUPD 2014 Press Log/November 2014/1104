               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: I spoke with Shanae Nicholson
               this evening at the WSU Police Department. She is very
               frustrated with Barbara Ward and feels she is being singled out
               while in class. She hinted at the fact she feels as if Barbary
               may even be racist. Shanae is going to contact the Office for
               Equal Opportunity to discuss the whole situation. She is open
               to having Angie Hammond contact her, but is unsure how soon she
               is willing to attend a meeting. In talking with Shanae is
               sounds as if it was never her intent to scare anyone in the
               department. She asked that she be allowed to have an advocate
               from her church as well as myself attend the meeting when it
               takes place. She did express she would likely be loud and vocal
               as she was today, but wanted me there to provide assurance to
               you and your staff that everything would remain safe. More to

               110414 around 1712 hrs Ofc Kirshner and I were dispatched to a
               report of a two car non injury and non blocking collision on
               Stadium Wy near Cougar Wy. We were told both vehicles had moved
               out of the roadway and were now in the Streit Perham Parking
               lot awaiting contact. Upon my arrival I contacted both drivers,
               later identified as Chad J Cook (102589) and Brandon I En'Wezoh
               (042592), and initially spoke to Cook, who told me the
               following. Cook explained he had been driving North on Stadium
               Wy when he approached the intersection at Cougar Wy. Cook went
               on to tell me he was in the process of turning left on a yellow
               light when the vehicle driven by En'Wezoh entered the
               intersection and struck the front end of his vehicle. The
               result of the collision caused the drivers side knee airbag to
               deploy before his vehicle came to rest along with En'Wezoh's. A
               short period of time elapsed at which point both drivers asked
               if the other was ok, at which point they moved both vehicles
               into the Streit/Perham key were we contacted them. Around this
               point Ofc Kirshner arrived and began taking photos of the
               damage to both vehicles as well as speaking with En'Wezoh. At
               this point I began to look at the damage to each vehicle at
               which point I spoke with Kirshner. He explained the version of
               events En'Wezoh had told him was similar to that of Cooks with
               the exception of the traffic light being green. I certify and

               NARRATIVE: On 11/04/14 at approximately 2158 hours, I was
               dispatched to a drugs call at Rogers Hall room 1139. Upon
               arrival I contacted the RED on duty Britteny L. Alspach
               04/04/89, who stated that there was a very strong odor of
               marijuana coming from room 1139. As soon as I entered the
               hallway of the 11th floor I could smell the strong odor of
               burnt marijuana. When I reached room 1139 the odor was very
               intense. I knocked on the door and a male's voice said he would
               be there in a minute. After approximately 30 seconds, Torsen J.
               Etscheid 04/19/96, opened the door. As soon as Etscheid opened
               the door the odor intensified. I told Etscheid, and his friend,
               Ashlie C. Roswall 10/10/94, to come into the hallway. Once in
               the hallway I asked them if they were over 18 and under 21.
               Both said yes. I also asked if either one of them had a medical
               marijuana authorization. Both said no. I told both that as long
               as they were willing to turn over their marijuana and smoking
               devices I would only be referring them to student conduct. Both
               agreed and went into the room. Etscheid and Roswall returned
               with a metal grinder and rolling papers. Etscheid said that
               they had smoked the last of their marijuana. Etscheid, Roswall,
               and I walked out to the dumpster where the illegal items were
               destroyed. I explained the Student Conduct process to both and
               told them they were free to go. END OF REPORT I certify and

               Suicide Attempt 2. NARRATIVE: On 11/05/14 at approximately 0055
               hours, I was dispatched to a suicide attempt call at Northside
               Hall. Dispatch stated that RA's were out with a male who just
               tried to jump off the 3rd floor outside terrace of Northside.
               As I was arriving dispatch updated me stating that RA's had the
               male restrained. I ran up to the third floor and found several
               RA's and other people out on the terrace. One person pointed me
               to a male sitting in one of the outside chairs. I walked over
               to the male, later identified as Hudson Bradley Flynn 03/12/96,
               and introduced myself and asked what was going on. Flynn stated
               that he has two strikes against him from the university for
               getting in trouble related to alcohol. Tonight he was at his
               dorm room with friends when someone knocked on the door. Flynn
               said his friends would not answer the door so he did as his
               friends hid. Flynn stated it was the RA's who had knocked.
               Flynn turned over a bottle of alcohol to the RA and he knew he
               was going to get in trouble again. Flynn stated he became upset
               because his parents knew about him getting in trouble earlier
               and he could not go through that again. About this time Ofc.
               Welter arrived on scene and began to talk with witnesses (see
               Ofc. Welter's supplement for further details). I asked Flynn
               why he wanted to jump off the building. Flynn said, "because I
               can't get kicked out of school, I'd rather kill myself than get
               kicked out of school." I asked Flynn if he had planned to jump
               off the building. Flynn said he was going to jump untill his
               roommate stopped him from doing so. I told Flynn about the
               resources that were available to him by going to the hospital.
               I also told Flynn about the free services at WSU Counseling
               Center. I asked Flynn if he would be willing to go to the
               hospital so he could talk to someone about what was going on.
               Flynn said he would. I walked Flynn to my patrol car. Once
               Flynn sat down Ofc. Welter filled me in about what he had
               learned. Ofc. Welter stated that Flynn had reached the point of
               putting one foot onto of the glass wall in order to jump off
               the building before Flynn's roommate ran up and grabbed him.
               Ofc. Welter stated that it appeared that Flynn had seriously
               intended on jumping. Due to Ofc. Welter's update I determined
               it was best to take Flynn to PRH in a protective custody
