               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W4906 SYNOPSIS: Report of harassing
               messages written on a chalk board. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 11-24-14 at about 1104 hours I
               was dispatched to the report of harassment at Community/Duncan
               Dunn. The RP, Richard A. Wallace, was requesting phone contact.
               I called Wallace and he told me that he is the RED for
               Community/Duncan Dunn. He said that the "break RA" notified him
               of harassing messages that had been written on the chalkboard
               in the lounge area of the hall. He identified the RA as
               Madeline Marsh. Wallace told me that Marsh had taken pictures
               of the chalkboard and erased it. Wallace sent me the pictures
               that were taken via email. In the pictures I saw that somebody
               had written "Riley's a fag!", "Riley & Wyatt are geeds!!",
               "Riley + Wyatt = LOVE" and there was a drawing of a penis
               ejaculating onto the head of a stick figure labeled as "Wyatt".
               I sent Wallace an email asking for contact information for all
               of the "Riley's" and "Wyatt's" in the hall, which he did. On
               the list that was sent I noticed that Riley Bott and Wyatt Hyer
               are roommates in room 169. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the

               $1000.00 WITNESS(ES): None NARRATIVE: On 11-24-14 at about 1319
               hours I was driving southbound on Stadium Way near the CUE
               parking garage when I saw somebody from the parking lot
               flagging me down. I then saw on my MDC that there was a
               collision that was currently being reported at that location. I
               pulled into the parking lot in front of the CUE parking garage
               and contacted Haley R. Love, Kendra C. Griffin and Susan M.
               Vogtman. I asked if anybody was injured and they all said no.
               Love explained to me that she was driving her 2011 Jeep
               Cherokee, WA/ARZ9182, southbound on Stadium Way through the
               intersection of Grimes Way when the car driven by Vogtman
               turned from Grimes Way, changed lanes and then drove into her,
               sideswiping both the driver's side doors on her Jeep. Love said
               that she was in the outside lane and that her light was green.
               Love told me that she was going the speed limit, through the
               intersection, and that there were cars in front of and behind
               her that also went through the intersection. Griffin was a
               passenger in Love's vehicle. She explained the same version of
               events as Love did. I then spoke to Susan M. Vogtman. Vogtman
               was driving her 2005 Toyota Camry, ID/1LA6010, on Grimes Way
               and she told me that she stopped for the red light. She said
               she waited at the intersection until her light turned green, at
               which piont she turned left onto Stadium Way. She said after
               making her turn she tried changing lanes from the inside to the
               outside lane when "out of nowhere" the Jeep came up beside her.
               I asked Vogtman if there were any cars in front of her and she
               said no, and added that there was nobody behind her. There was
               minimal scrapes and paint transfer on the front passenger side
               bumper of Vogtman's car. I took photo's of both vehciles
               involved, which were later downloaded under "Files". I provided
               each driver with an exchange of information sheet from SECTOR.
               I also explained to each driver that there is a traffic camera
               at that intersection and I may be able to view video from the
               time of the collision. Vogtman then told me that after thinking
               about the collision she may have "had a senior moment" and that

               maybe she did go through a red light. After returning to WSUPD
               I attempted to view video from this intersection. I was able to

               another burglary alarm at the coliseum and had contacted

               is the assistant director of the coliseum, and he had advised
               that they were testing alarms and accidentally activated the
               burglary alarm. For more information, see case #14-W4910. As I
               was preparing to respond back to the coliseum, Dispatch advised

               alarm was caused by employee error. No further law enforcement
               response was necessary, and I did not respond to the coliseum.
               No further action at this time. Olmstead/339 I certify and
