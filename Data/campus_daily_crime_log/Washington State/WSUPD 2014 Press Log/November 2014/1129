               Anthony M. Steerman-Phillips 09/27/95 Charges Forwarded MIP
               Possession 2. NARRATIVE: On 11/29/14 at approximately 1810
               hours, I was working the WSU Football game at Martin Stadium. I
               was standing near the Student Plaza when I saw a male walking
               up the stairs from the Student Plaza towards Gate I. The male
               caught my attention because as he walked he was stumbling side
               to side and bumping into his friends walking with him. The
               male, later identified as Anthony M. Steerman-Phillips
               09/27/95, was a stark contrast against the several other people
               walking near him who were having no difficulty walking
               straight. As Phillips walked up the stairs I noticed he
               appeared to be under the age of 21. When Phillips reached the
               top of the stairs I grabbed onto the back of his jacket and
               told Phillips that I needed to speak with him. We walked over
               to a secluded area away from crowd. I told Phillips the reason
               that I wanted to talk with him and asked for his ID. As
               Phillips was retrieving his WADL, I asked Phillips if he was as
               WSU student and he said yes. Phillips provided me with his WADL
               that identified him as 19 years old. I asked Phillips if I
               could look at his eyes and he said I could. I told Phillips to
               stand with his heels and toes together and to follow the tip of
               my pen without moving his head. Phillips stated he understood.
               During the HGN test I observed, equal tracking, lack of smooth
               pursuit, distinct and sustained nystagmus in both eyes.
               Phillips eyes were watery and bloodshot. During the test
               Phillips was swaying side to side. As Phillips stood before me
               I could clearly smell the odor of intoxicants coming from his
               breath. I asked Phillips how much he had to drink. Phillips
               stated he had two beers. I told Phillips I would not be talking
               to him if he only had two beers. I asked Phillips if he wanted
               to be more honest with me and Phillips again said he only had
               two beers. I told Phillips that he was under arrest for MIP and
               handcuffed (D/L) him. I walked Phillips to the processing room.
               Once at the processing room I searched Phillips incident to
               arrest. In Phillip's vest pockets I found two unopened Busch
               Light Beers cans. No other items of evidentiary value were
               found. I advised Phillips that he was being audio and video
               recorded. I read Phillips his Miranda Rights off my department
               issued card. Phillips stated he understood his rights. Once
               Phillip's paperwork was filled out I read him a copy of the
               ejection notice. Phillip was turned over to Ofc. Olin who later

               cited and released. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               Smith, Nicholas M./040893 Cited and Released Crim Trespass 2nd
               #C9026 2. NARRATIVE: On 11/29/14 at about 1824 hours while
               working at the WSU vs UW Football game I contacted Nicholas M.
               Smith (DOB 040893) outside of Gate I Martin Stadium Pullman, WA
               because he was staggering and appeared intoxicated. Once close
               to Smith I could smell the odor of intoxicants coming from him.
               His eyes were watery and when I asked if I could see his
               identification he fumble with his wallet and had difficultly
               getting his identification out. I told Smith that due to his
               intoxication he was not going to be allowed into the stadium.
               Smith became agitated and argumentative. He wanted to know what
               the specific law that allowed us to keep him out of the
               stadium. He admitted he had been drinking but said there was
               nothing wrong with being drunk in public. I explained once
               again that he was not allowed to come into the game. At this
               point Smith turned and walked towards the Staff Pro employee at
               Gate I attempting to enter the stadium. Smith dropped his
               identification attempting to show it to the Staff Pro employee.
               I moved to the other side of the barricade and approached
               Smith. Smith continued to argue, saying there was no legal
               reason for him to be kept out of the stadium. At this time I
               turned on my video camera. Officer Stewart explained to Smith
               that he had to leave the stadium and could not return within
               300 feet of the stadium for the rest of the night and if he
               remained unlawfully he would be placed under arrest. Smith said
               that he wanted us to prove that he was intoxicated. Officer
               Stewart asked if he would provide a breath sample for the PBT
               and Smith said he would. Smith did provide a breath sample for
               my PBT and the result was .243. Smith still refused to leave
               and continued to argue. I explained to Smith again that he had
               two options he could leave the stadium area or if he remained
               unlawfully in the stadium area he would be arrested. Smith
               refused to leave, and continued to argue. I placed Smith under
               arrest for criminal trespass, handcuffed him(DL) and took him
               to the processing room. In the processing room I read Smith his
               Miranda warnings from my department issued Miranda card. I
               searched Smith, and called for a transport to take him to
               Pullman Police Department holding area. He was transported to
               Pullman PD by Sgt. Jacobson. On 11/30/14 at about 0020 I went
               to Pullman PD. I fingerprinted, photographed and cited Smith

               MIP C8133 2. NARRATIVE: On 11/29/14 at approximately 1835
               hours, I was working at the WSU Football game at Martin
               Stadium. I was standing near the Student Plaza monitoring the
               crowd when a female walking up the stairs caught my attention.
               The female stood out because as she walked she was stumbling
               side to side and at one point stumbled into the railing of the
               staircase. The female, later identified as Ashley A. Seen-
               Garcia 03/08/95, was talking on her cell phone as she walked. I
               could hear Garcia loudly say something to the effect of, "I'm
               at the fucking game where are you at." Garcia's words were slow
               and deliberate as well as slurred. Garcia's whole demeanor was
               exaggerated. Garcia appeared to be under the age of 21. When
               Garcia reached the top of the stairs I told her that we needed
               to talk and I escorted Garcia to a secluded area away from the
               crowd. I told Garcia what I had observed and stated that I
               believed that her behavior was due to her drinking. I asked
               Garcia for her ID and Garcia provided her WSU Cougar Card. I
               asked Garcia how old she was and Garcia said she was 19 years
               old. I asked Garcia if I could look at her eyes and she said I
               could. I had Garcia stand with her heels and toes together. I
               told Garcia to follow the tip of my pen with her eyes only and
               to keep her head still. During the test I observed, equal
               tracking, lack of smooth pursuit, and distinct and sustained
               nystagmus in both eyes. Garcia eyes were watery and bloodshot.
               During the test Garcia was swaying forwards and backwards. I
               could clearly smell the odor of intoxicants coming from
               Garcia's breath as she stood before me. I asked Garcia how much
               she had to drink tonight. Garcia said she had a shot or two. I
               told Garcia that I believed that she had much more than just
               two shots. Garcia began to plead with me to let her go home
               because she was arrested for MIP in Tacoma not long ago and her
               parents will kick her out of school if she gets in trouble
               again. Garcia said her arrest was about a year ago. I told
               Garcia that she was under arrest for MIP and handcuffed (D/L)
               her. I walked Garcia to the processing room where she was
               searched incident to arrest. Nothing of evidentiary value was

               standing near the south west corner of Hollingberry Field House
               watching people enter the stadium through the student plaza. I
               noticed a female, later identified as Brooke L. Baxley
               (102594), who appeared to be under the age of 21 and was
               stumbling side to side. I heard Baxley turn to one of her
               friends, who was not identified, and say "We are so fucked up",
               referring to her high level of intoxication. I contacted Baxley
               and asked how much she had to drink. She admitted to consuming
               alcohol but said he did not have much. I asked to check her
               eyes and she agreed. I administered a horizontal gaze nystagmus
               test on her and observed she had bloodshot and watery eyes, a
               lack of smooth pursuit, and a distinct and sustained nystagmus
               at maximum deviation. I could smell the odor of intoxicants on
               her breath as I administered the test. I asked Baxley how old
               she was and she admitted to being 20. I told her she was under
               arrest for MIP exhibiting and advised her of her right to
               remain silent and her right to an attorney. I escorted Baxley
               to the processing room where I read her an ejection notice and

               unconscious in the Crimson Parking Lot off of Linden St. She
               was transported to PRH. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               2. NARRATIVE: On 11-29-14 at approximately 1857 hours, I
               responded to the Crimson Lot at the corner of Thatuna St and
               Linden for the report of an unconscious female. I arrived and
               was directed by bystanders to a female who was laying on her
               side at the bottom of the stairs leading off of Colorado St.
               She was covered in bystanders jackets and was unconscious and
               unresponsive. They bystanders stated they found her laying on
               her back and thought she was beginning to vomit so they rolled
               her on her side. I checked to make sure she was breathing and
               had a pulse. She would not respond to any stimulus. Bystanders
               said they have no idea who she was or what happened to her. She
               had a cardboard sign around her neck which I was able to look
               at later that said, "UW Wears Cargos". I could smell a strong
               odor of intoxicants emitting from her breath. Pullman Medics
               arrived and I assisted them in preparing her for transport. I
               was able to find her Cougar Card in her pocket and she was
               identified as Megan T. Kubitz. I also found a cell phone in her
               pocket which had a shattered screen. I followed the ambulance
               to PRH. At the hospital she was intubated and admitted for
               overnight observations. I attempted to contact her parents, but
               there was no answer. I left a voicemail on both numbers I
               called. I left her identification and cell phone with her
               property. I later returned to the area she was found and took
               photographs. I observed there was some deicer on the stairs. It
               is unknown if she fell or if she just passed out. I did not
               identify any of the bystanders since none of them had any
               information. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 29th day of November, 2014, in

               NARRATIVE: On 11/29/14, while working at the WSU vs. UW
               football game,I was dispatched by Martin Stadium command to the
               west end of Martin Stadium stands Pullman, WA for a
               disturbance. I spoke with Stephen P. Fields (DOB 111489). He
               stated that two females had been standing on the concourse
               above him in the bleachers when someone told him the females
               were spitting on his bag. Fields confronted the females, later
               identified as Melissa A. Marquez (DOB 102495) and Mackenzie R.
               Altig (DOB 072793) and asked them to clean off his bag. Then he
               stated that Altig knocked the bag down, out of his hands.
               Officer Stewart and I escorted Marquez and Altig to processing.
               Once we entered the covered portion of the concourse near Gate
               I Altig leaned in and said something to Marquez. The foot
               traffic in this area was very heavy and Marquez moved quickly
               ahead attempting to evade us. Officer Stewart caught up to
               Marquez and placed her in a control hold and continued to
               escort her to processing. I placed Altig in a straight wrist
               twist lock and escorted her towards processing. While on our
               way to processing Altig attempted twice to grab Officer Stewart
               with her free hand. In processing, I asked Altig and Marquez
               what their names and dates of birth were. Altig's speech was
               slurred but she was able to give me her name and date of birth.
               Marquez's speech was slurred and she was unable to tell me her
               date of birth. I had to ask what year she was born, which took
               her some time. I asked her what month she was born which also
               took some time. Then I asked her what was her day of birth
               which she gave as the 22nd. There was no record for Marquez
               with that date of birth. I asked her what state her driver's
               license was from, she stated Washington. I asked her again what
               her date of birth was, this time she said that the day of birth
               was the 24th. Marquez and Altig stated they were both
               University of Washington students. Marquez and Altig both
               denied knowing anything about the confrontation with Fields.
               They were both ejected from the game for intoxication and
               disorderly conduct. Charges were forwarded for Minor Exhibiting
               the Effects of Alcohol on Marquez. Charge forwarded and report
               sent to UW student conduct. Officer Curtis Whitman WSU Police

               were treating an individual who was later identified as Samuel
               T. Ohara (DOB 12-01-1993). Ohara was 20 years old. I learned
               that Ohara had slipped on the ice and hit his head on the
               ground. I observed a swollen bump and laceration on the right
               side of Ohara's forehead. Ohara was disoriented and believed he
               was in Spokane, Washington. Ohara was not able to respond to
               questioning, his speech was slurred, and he could not stand up
               without assistance. I could smell the odor of alcohol
               originating from Ohara. I evaluated Ohara and determined that
               he appeared to be incapacitated by alcohol in a public place. I
               placed Ohara into protective custody, and he was transported to
               Pullman Regional Hospital via ambulance. I responded to the
               hospital and completed the Protective Custody Form. Ohara was
               admitted to the hospital, and I cleared the scene. The
               Protective Custody Form was scanned and attached to this case.
               No further action at this time. Olmstead/339 I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               Forwarded MIP Exhibiting 2. NARRATIVE: On 11/29/14 at
               approximately 1920 hours I was working the WSU football game at
               Martin Stadium. I was standing near the Student Plaza
               monitoring the crowd when Dep. Pelissier pointed out a female
               in the crowd. The female, later identified as Taylor Lynn-
               Pumala Curry 07/15/96, was having extreme difficulty walking
               unsupported. Curry was being assisted by a male who had his arm
               around her back as they walked. Even with the assistance of the
               male, Curry was stumbling into the male. Curry had a blank
               dased look upon her face. Curry appeared to be under the age of
               21. I walked up to Curry and told her we needed to talk. I
               escorted Curry over to a secluded area away from the crowd.
               Worried about Curry falling over I asked her to walk over to a
               nearby wall. When Curry reached it she leaned up against the
               wall for support. I asked for Curry's ID and she provided her
               WSU Cougar Card. I asked Curry if she was a WSU student and she
               said, "I'm a student with waisio, Washington State University
               wiz i o." Curry's words were so heavily slurred that I was
               having difficulty understanding what she was saying. I asked
               Curry how old she was and Curry replied, "Washington State,
               Washington 19." Curry corrected herself and said she was 18
               years old. I aksed Curry what her date of birth was and she
               said, "Taylor Lurther, oh date of birth, 17 19 1960, 7/15/96."
               As Curry spoke I could clearly smell the overpowering odor of
               intoxicants coming from her breath. I asked Curry if I could
               check her eyes and she said I could. I told Curry to follow the
               tip of my pen with her eyes only and not to move her head.
               During the test I observed, equal tracking, lack of smooth
               pursuit, and distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum
               deviation in both eyes. Even though Curry was leaning against
               the wall, she was still swaying back and forth during the test.
               I asked Curry a series of questions to determine her mental
               status. Curry was able to answer most of my questions correctly
               even though her words were heavily slurred. I asked Curry if
               she was willing to provide a PBT sample. Curry asked why. I
               told Curry it was because I believed her to be highly
               intoxicated. Curry replied, "I've only had, hardly anything to
               drink." I asked Curry if she was willing to do the PBT and
               Curry said, "I don't want to go to jail." I told Curry that I
               did not ask her if she wanted to go to jail, I had asked her if

               she was willing to provide a breath sample. Curry replied, "I
               want to go watch the football game if that's ok." I told Curry
               that she was under arrest for MIP and handcuffed (D/L) her. I
               walked Curry to the processing room. While walking there I had
               to keep a tight grip on Curry's arm because she was stumbling
               so bad. Once at the processing room I searched Curry incident
               to arrest and found nothing of evidentiary value. I told Curry
               that she was being audio and video recorded. A WSUPD Intern was
               attempting to get Curry's current address and Curry was not
               making sense. I again asked Curry another series of questions
               and this time she did worse. I asked for medics to respond to
               the processing room to evaluate Curry's condition. Once the
               medics arrived they evaluated her for 21 minutes before
               deciding that they should move her down to the first aid room
               for treatment due to her high level of intoxication. Charges of
               MIP Exhibiting will be forwarded to the Prosecutor. END OF

               NARRATIVE: On 11/29/14 at about 1941 hrs I was working at the
               WSU vs UW football game at Martin Stadium. I was standing near
               the north end of the student plaza when I noticed a female,
               later identified as Alexandrea B. Mcgee (031094), who appeared
               to be under the age of 21. She caught my attention because she
               was stumbling and walked around the end of a barricade and near
               a trailer next to the field house. As I began walking toward
               her she walked back around the barricade and to the north side
               of the field house. As I came around the corner of the field
               house I could see Mcgee beginning to squat down next to a car.
               She had both thumbs inside the top of her pants and was
               beginning to pull them down when she saw me approaching. She
               stood up and began to walk away quickly. I called to her and
               told her to stop and not to run away. She continued to walk
               very quickly across the parking lot toward Cougar Way. I caught
               up to her at the north end of the parking lot near a small
               ticket booth. I told her I saw her about to urinate in public
               and advised her that was a violation of city code. I asked how
               much she had to drink and she admitted to consuming alcohol. I
               asked if I could check her eyes and she agreed. I administered
               a horizontal gaze nystagmus test and observed she had bloodshot
               and watery eyes, a lack of smooth pursuit, and a distinct and
               sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation. I could smell the
               odor of intoxicants on her breath as I spoke with her. I
               advised her she was under arrest for MIP exhibiting and advised
               her of her right to remain silent and her right to an attorney.
               I escorted her to the processing room where I read her an
               ejection notice and provided her with a copy. I explained to
               her I would be forwarding charges to the prosecutor's office
               and she was escorted out of the stadium. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 30 day of November, 2014, in Pullman,

               Campbell instead stood still and said he wanted to talk. I told
               Campbell to walk towards the exit of the Student Plaza several
               times before I placed my hand on his back and told him to start
               walking. Campbell was still refusing to walk and I pushed him
               forward towards the exit. Campbell was still not cooperating so
               I grabbed Campbell's right tricep with my left hand to escort
               him out of the student plaza. While doing this Campbell
               continued to argue that we needed to talk right now inside the
               plaza. While Campbell was arguing with me I could smell the
               very strong odor of intoxicants coming from his breath.
               Campbell's eyes were also watery and bloodshot. Campbell raised
               his left arm above his head in an attempt to overcome my escort
               control hold. I grabbed Campbell's right wrist in an attempt to
               place Campbell's hands behind his back for cuffing. I told
               Campbell to put his hands behind his back and Campbell started
               to turn in a circle to get away from me. Dep. Pelissier was
               able to grab Campbell's left arm. I told Campbell several times
               to relax and stop resisting. Campbell continued to tense up and
               wiggle around. After several seconds Dep. Pelissier and I were
               able to handcuff Campbell. Once handcuffed I walked Campbell
               outside of the Student Plaza which he did not have a legal
               right to be in. When we exited the student plaza I told
               Campbell I would listen to what he had to say. Campbell stated
               that he had a ticket for the game but Staff Pro took it and
               would not let him into the game. I asked what kind of ticket he
               had and Campbell said he was not completely sure but he got it
               from a friend and it was something like a sports medicine
               intern ticket. I asked if it was a paper ticket and Campbell
               said it was. I asked what size the ticket was. Campbell said he
               did not know but it was normal size. I was not believing
               Campbell's story because Staff Pro scans tickets using handheld

               scanners and do not physically take tickets. I explained to
               Campbell that Staff Pro is employed by WSU Athletics and they
               have the right to refuse entrance into the football game to
               intoxicated or unruly fans. Campbell agreed with me. I also
               told Campbell that if Staff Pro tells him he must leave the
               premises that he must do so and no longer has a legal right to
               be at the stadium. While Campbell was explaining his side of
               the story he said, "I understand, you have a lot of people to
               get in, and if I'm apparently making a scene then I shouldn't
               get in but I really did not think that was the situation." I
               started to tell Campbell that I was going to run his name and
               let him go but Campbell kept interrupting me. Once I got
               Campbell to stop talking I told him that after I ran his name
               and if he had no warrants he would be free to go. I also told
               Campbell if he came back to the stadium I would arrest him for
               Criminal Trespass and he would be taken to jail. I asked
               Campbell, "is that 100% clear?" Campbell said, "I understand."
               I ran Campbell through dispatch and they stated he was clear. I
               again told Campbell that he was not allowed at the football
               game and if he was found to be at the stadium he would be
               arrested for trespassing. Campbell continued to argue with me
               stating that he did not understand why he could not go into the
               game. I told Campbell that he was going to be free to go but he
               continued to argue with me. I finally had to turn Campbell
               around to take of his handcuffs. Once the handcuffs were
               removed I told Campbell leave. Campbell still wanted to argue
               so I walked away. I remained in the area of the student plaza
               to make sure Campbell did not return. After a few minutes I
               cleared the area. At 1730 hours I went to my assignment of
               patrolling sections 13 to 26 of Martin Stadium. At
               approximately 2000 hours I was walking along top concourse near
               section 18 when I noticed Campbell walking towards me. Campbell
               was wearing the exact same clothing as before and I instantly
               recognized him. I grabbed ahold of Campbell and told him he was
               under arrest for Criminal Trespass. Campbell was handcuffed
               (D/L) without incident. I told Campbell that he was being audio
               and video recorded. Once I had Campbell at the processing room
               I read Campbell his Miranda Rights off my department issued
               card. Campbell stated he understood his rights. I fill out and
               issued Campbell criminal citation C8134 for RCW 9A.52.080
               criminal trespass. I explained the citation to Campbell and
               added it to his property. Campbell stated that he bought ticket
               from a scalper for $100 dollars and did not realize that he
               could not come to the football game. I told Campbell he was
               told he could not be at the game several times. Cpl. Daniels
               transported Campbell to the Pullman Holding Facility where he
               was housed until after the football game. Once the game was
               completed Dep. Pelissier transported Campbell to the Whitman
               County Jail for booking. A copy of the PC Booking sheet was
               faxed to the jail. END OF REPORT I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 1st day of

               2014 hours Cpl. Daniels and I were dispatched to the CUB for an
               intoxicated female. We responded to the building. Upon our
               arrival I recognized the patient. Sgt. Jacobson and I had dealt
               with her about 15 minutes prior. We provided a courtesy
               transport for her and her friend to the CUB. The patient was
               identified as Megan E. Ramberg (12/23/93). Ramberg is a
               University of Washington student. It is unknown how much
               alcohol she consumed. Ramberg was not alert, she was drooling,
               and had urinated in her pants. Per RCW 70.96A.120, Ramberg

               females walking on the inner concourse near section 31 at
               Martin Stadium Pullman, WA. One of the females was staggering
               and the other was trying to hold her up. I contacted the female
               that appeared intoxicated Haley M. Higgins (DOB 121995), and
               escorted her to processing. In processing I asked Higgins if I
               could see her identification, she said I could. She took a cell
               phone and a ticket to the football game, and said they "would
               both ID". I asked her again for identification and she again
               said they "would both ID". Higgins' speech was very slurred. I
               then asked her what her name was. She told me her name. I then
               asked what her date of birth was, and she spelled her last
               name. I asked again several times and she kept spelling her
               last name. After trying several ways to ask her what her date
               of birth was she said she was born in 1995, then she told me
               she was born in December and finally after several questions
               that she was born on the 19th. The friend she was with earlier
               found Higgins father who was in the stadium and he came to
               processing. I read Higgins the ejection warning and ejected her
               from the stadium and told her that I was forwarding charges for
               Minor Exhibiting the Effects of Alcohol. I released Higgins to

               Gunter was 19 years old. Gunter was sitting in a chair inside

               statements. He was uncontrollably throwing his arms around, and
               his movements were uncoordinated. Gunter was disoriented and
               did not realize he was inside his own room. Gunter could not
               directly answer questions and spoke with garbled, one word
               responses unrelated to the questions I had asked him. Gunter
               fell off the chair and onto the ground. I could detect the odor
               of alcohol originating from Gunter. Pullman Fire Department
               personnel arrived on scene and evaluated Gunter. Gunter was

               Evan J. Vinyard (DOB 010493) and we began to escort him to
               processing because he was intoxicated. Officer Stewart was
               controlling his right arm and I took control of his left arm.
               As we walked towards processing Vinyard began to argue that he
               was not intoxicated. Officer Stewart said to Vinyard "you can't
               even walk in a straight line". Vinyard stopped walking and
               began to pull his arms away, saying I can walk a straight line.
               Officer Stewart told Vinyard not to pull away and told him to
               keep walking. Vinyard continued to pull his arms away. At one
               point he pulled his left arm free from my hold and also from
               Officer Stewart hold as well. Officer Westerman came over to
               help us get Vinyard under control. Vinyard continued to flail
               his arms, so we took him to the ground and handcuffed him.
               Vinyard was told that he was under arrest for Obstructing a Law
               Enforcement Officer. We got him up and went to processing.
               While in processing I read him his Miranda warnings from my
               department issued Miranda card and searched him incident to
               arrest. Vinyard had a small abrasion on his chin. He was asked
               if he wanted to be seen by EMS, but refused. I photographed his
               injury. Vinyard was read the trespass warning, I wrote him a
               citation (#C8135)and he was ejected from the game. Cited and

               Pullman Fire and WSU Police were dispatched to an injured male
               at Wilson Road and Lincoln Drive. I responded to the scene.
               Pullman Fire personnel arrived on scene at the same time. An
               intoxicated male had run down a snow and ice covered hillside
               on the east side of the Ensminger Pavilion. His friend saw him
               slip on the ice, falling, hitting his head on a parked F150
               truck and the pavement. The patient was unconscious upon our
               arrival. There was no damage to the F150. It was new truck and
               only had a temporary license. The friend said the patient had
               consumed 12 to 14 beers over a 4 to 5 hour period. I assisted
               Fire personnel with patient care. As we were securing the
               patient to the backboard he regained consciousness and began to
               fight us. At the medics direction I handcuffed the patient to
               the backboard. The patient was loaded into the ambulance and
               transported to the hospital. I followed the ambulance to the
               hospital. The male was combative with the hospital staff.
               Eventually the hospital staff was able to use their restraints
               and I was able to remove my handcuffs. No further
               investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury

               was 31 years old. Leichner was sitting on the ground, and I
               noticed that he had vomited all over his legs. Leichner
               continued to throw up, and his pants and jacket were covered
               with vomit. Leichner's head was slumped over his lap, he could
               not stand up, and he was not able to speak. I could detect the
               odor of alcohol originating from Leichner. Pullman Fire

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W4991 SYNOPSIS: Staff Pro advised of a
               female who was assaulted in the stands at the WSU vs UW

               Assault 4 2. NARRATIVE: On 11/29/14 at about 2057 hrs I was
               walking through the outer concourse of Martin Stadium near
               section 30 during the WSU vs UW football game. A staff pro
               member approached Deputy Cooper and I and advised us a female
               was assaulted in the stands. He directed us to the female,
               later identified as Alyssa M. Angell (100292). Angell was
               holding her left hand, which was bleeding, and said she wanted
               to press charges for an assault. She told us she was in the
               stands and a male, later identified as Gaiges C. Gray (020593),
               began trying to start a fight with some other males in the
               stands. Angell tried to get Gray's attention to calm him down
               and "playfully" took his beanie cap off his head. Gray became
               angry and lunged at Angell. Angell put her left hand up, with
               an open palm facing Gray, to stop him. She said she did not hit
               him but may have contacted his face inadvertently because of
               his movement toward her. Gray then bit Angell's left hand,
               through her glove, breaking the skin and leaving obvious bite
               marks. Gray grabbed Angell by the hair and raised his other
               arm, as if to hit Angell. Gray's friends were able to calm him
               down and got him to walk away. I asked Angell if I could look
               at her hand. She showed me her left hand. the middle finger was
               bleeding from a laceration near the first knuckle on the palm
               side of her finger. On the backhand side of her middle finger
               there was an obvious impression from a tooth. I photographed
               the injuries. I walked with the staff pro employee to the area
               in the stands where the incident occurred but upon our arrival
               Gray was gone. He thought one of the other officers may have
               walked Gray to the processing room. I asked Deputy Cooper to
               walk with Angell to the medic station to have her finger
               treated while I went to the processing room. As we were walking
               in the direction of the processing room/medical station Angell
               pointed to a male near the bathrooms and said that was the male
               that assaulted her. We contacted Gray, who was immediately
               defensive. He said he already talked to an officer, who told
               them to go their separate ways and the situation was taken care
               of. I told him I did not know if he spoke with another officer
               or who that may have been if he did. Gray was very agitated and
               animated so we placed him in handcuffs. I advised him he was

               not under arrest but was being detained while we investigated
               and figured out what was going on. I left Gray with Deputy
               Cooper while I continued with Angell to the medic staion and
               had her begin on a written statement. I then spoke with Deputy
               Cooper who said Gray admitted to biting Angell but said it was
               in self defense because she punched him in the face after her
               friends said they were going to "jump him". Gray had a small
               split on the left side of his lower lip. It was not clear if
               that was from being hit. It could have been from being struck
               or just split from being cold and coming in contact with
               Angell's hand while she put it up to stop him. The split also
               could have been from when he bit Gray. Gray was escorted to the
               processing room while I checked with Angell. She again said she
               did not punch Gray but may have inadvertently contacted his
               face with her hand when she put it up to stop his forward
               movement toward her. I contacted Gray and told him he was under
               arrest for assault for biting Angell. I told him I was going to
               find some other wittnesses in the stands before getting a
               statement from him myself, if he wished to give one. I went to
               the area of the stands indicated by staff pro as the location
               of the incident. Many people had already left the area and
               those remaining denied seeing any altercation occur in the
               stands. I returned to the processing room and read Gray his
               constitutional rights from a pre-printed card. He said he
               understood his rights but did not wish to make any statement at
               that time. I told him that was fine. I explained to him that I
               would be forwarding chares to the Whitman County Prosecutor for
               Assault and they would make a charging determination. Gray was
               still very upset over the incident and insisted he spoke with
               another officer and that officer simply told them to go their
               separate ways. I explained to him I did not know who that
               officer was or if it was an actual officer or just a security
               person. I asked if I could photograph his lip and he said yes.
               He also said he wished to provide a written statement at that
               time. I photographed the small split on his lip. I provided
               Gray with a Consitutional Rights form, which he read and signed
               waiving his rights. I provided him with a written statement
               form which he filled out and signed. The form was added to the
               case file along with Angell's statement form. I read Gray an
               ejection notice and he was escorted from the stadium. Charges
               forwarded to the prosecutor's office for assault 4th degree on
               Gray. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 30 day of November,

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W4992 SYNOPSIS: Male subject was ejected
               from Martin Stadium for intoxication and trespassed. He later
               returned to Martin Stadium and was contacted by Staff Pro. He
               was transported to Pullman PD and later booked into Whitman
               County Jail. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Armando J.
               Espinosa (031889) Arrested,booked Crim. Trespass, Mal Mish 3,
               Harrasment . Booked 2. NARRATIVE: On 112914 at approximately
               2021 hours, I was working with Officer Whitman at the WSU vs UW
               football game in Martin Stadium dealing with a female arrestee
               in the Martin Stadium processing room when Armando J. Espinosa
               was brought in by Staff Pro crowd management. Espinosa was
               sitting in the room next to Ofc. Whitman's arrestee, and was
               later ejected from Martin Stadium and told not to return by
               Sgt. Larsen. (See his supplemental narrative) At approximately
               2055 hours, I was in processing dealing with another situation,
               when Staff Pro Bryan Custer brought Espinosa in again. Sgt.
               Larsen told me that he had ejected Espinosa and trespassed him
               from Martin Stadium for the remainder of the football game. I
               told Espinosa he was under arrest for criminal trespass and I
               handcuffed him. I read Espinosa his constitutional rights and
               he told me he understood them. Espinosa was transported to
               Pullman Police Department by Sgt. Bryan Jacobson. In the
               Pullman PD holding, Espinosa told Sgt. Jacobson that he was
               going to kill him when he got out of jail. (See Sgt. Jacobson's
               supplemental) Espinosa was placed in a holding cell at Pullman
               PD. Espinosa proceeded to place a roll of toilet paper in the
               toilet of his cell and continued flushing the toilet flooding
               three holding cells and half of the Pullman PD processing room.
               Pullman PD reception needed to call out maintenance to deal
               with the mess. Espinosa was later transported to Colfax Jail by
               Dep. Nebe for booking, and I completed a PC Booking Sheet and
               faxed it to Whitman County Jail in Colfax. I responded to
               Pullman PD and asked if they had a reimbursement/clean-up form
               completed. Pullman reception handed me the reimbursement form
               indicating it took 2 hours to clean the holding facility and
               cost $48.00. Charges to be forwarded on Espinosa for Criminal
               Trespass 1st degree, Malicious Mischief 3rd Degree, and
               Harassment of a Police Officer. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 30 day of

               Trespassing 1st Degree C8986 2. NARRATIVE: On 11-29-14 at about
               2000 hours I was on duty at Martin Stadium for the Apple Cup
               football game. I was stationed in the processing room. While
               there, Staff Pro employee Tim Holtorf, brought in two males for
               drinking alcohol in the game. Holtorf also confiscated a bottle
               of Southern Comfort from the males. The males were identified
               as Andrew S. Petersen/04-07-92 and Kyle J. Reichenbach/03-02-
               92. Holtorf told me that he saw the two males drink from the
               bottle in upper section 29. He completed a statement for me
               that said "observed outside alcohol both were drinking". While
               speaking with Petersen and Reichenbach they both admitted to
               drinking from the bottle of Southern Comfort. I explained to
               Petersen and Reichenbach that they were not allowed to have
               alcohol in the statdium. They stated they understood. I then
               read them both the pre-printed ejection warning for Martin
               Stadium and gave both of them a copy of it. Deputy Herman then
               escorted both males outside the Stadium gates through gate A.
               About an hour later I was sitting at the desk in the processing
               room when the door opened. I looked outside and saw a male
               standing there that I recognized as Andrew S. Petersen. I went
               out the door to contact Petersen and asked what he was doing
               inside the stadium. He said he wanted to talk with an officer
               about something. I told him that he was not allowed to be in
               the stadium and reminded him that I had just ejected him about
               an hour before. He said that he did not remember that. I told
               Petersen that he was under arrest for Criminal Trespass 1st
               degree. I placed him in handcuffs, double locked, and Deputy
               Nebe escorted him into the processing room, searched his
               person, and advised him of his right to an attorney. I then
               completed criminal citation C8986 for Petersen for criminal
               trespass 1st degree. While trying to explain the citation to
               Petersen he would interrupt me and say "this is bullshit" and
               that I "never" gave him a piece of paper telling him he was
               trespassed. I told him I both read the warning out loud and
               gave him a copy of the trespass warning. He then said that he
               knows I told him he was ejected but said I never told him he
               couldn't come back. I told Petersen that I wasn't going to
               argue with him about it and explained his criminal citation to
               him. I gave him the yellow copy and released him from custody.

               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Kaytlynn E. Dixon (120893)
               Arrested Obstructing C8987 2. NARRATIVE: On 112914 at
               approximately 2140 hours, I was working the student section of
               Martin Stadium for the WSU vs UW Apple Cup football game when I
               was flagged down by WSUPD Intern Michelle Thorgrimson. She told
               me that Intern Toni York was in the Women's bathroom outside
               section 26 and 27 with an intoxicated female vomiting. I
               responded to the women's bathroom with Thorgrimson and asked
               Thorgrimson to go in the bathroom and make sure all the women
               in the bathroom were fully clothed. Thorgrimson advised it was
               okay for me to come in the bathroom and I entered and went to
               the stall where York was standing. York told me that she was on
               rounds through the bathroom and saw two females in the bathroom
               stall later identified as Courtney N. Cahill and Kaytlynn E.
               Dixon. York identified Cahill as the female who was vomiting on
               the floor. I walked up to the stall and Dixon exited and
               contacted me. She stated that her friend (Cahill) was fine and
               she was going to take her home. I explained to Dixon that I
               needed to talk to her and she stepped in front of me and told
               me that she was going to take her home. I again told Dixon that
               I needed to talk to her and asked Dixon to move. Dixon again
               told me that I was not going to talk to her friend and that she
               was going with her. Dixon put her hands out attempting to
               create space so I couldn't get to Cahill. At this point, Cahill
               was standing right behind Dixon attempting to leave the stall.
               I told Dixon that if she didn't move, she would be placed under
               arrest for obstructing a public servant. She told me that she
               wasn't going anywhere and that I wasn't going to take her
               friend. She reached her arms out to attempt to stop me, and I
               grabbed her arm and placed it in a straight wrist twist lock
               behind her back. I told her she was under arrest for
               obstructing. I told Thorgrimson to handcuff Dixon. Dixon began
               struggling and telling me I was hurting her arm. I told her to
               stop resisting and she didn't. Thorgrimson grabbed her other
               arm and placed it behind Dixon's back at which point, she went
               limp and sat on the ground. I was able to get Dixon's hands
               handcuffed behind her back at this point, and Thorgrimson and I
               were able to escort her to processing room from the bathroom.
               Before leaving the bathroom, I asked York to escort Cahill to
               the processing room, and Cahill was much more cooperative. The

               entire walk to processing, Dixon complained about her arms
               hurting from the handcuffs. I checked multiple times during the
               walk and made sure that the handcuffs were not too tight, and
               it appeared Dixon was attempting to resist the handcuffs which
               were causing her arms to hurt. I continued to tell Dixon to
               stop resisting the handcuffs and to relax. Dixon refused. At
               the processing room, Dixon was extremely emotional. I advised
               her of her constitutional rights, and she cried nodding that
               she understood them. I attempted several times to get her name
               and DOB and she continued to argue with me. She continued to
               complain about the handcuffs hurting her arms. I made a deal
               with Dixon that she be more cooperative with me and not be
               resistive I would take off the handcuffs. Dixon agreed and I
               removed the handcuffs. Dixon became more cooperative and
               provided me with the information I needed for her criminal
               citation. I completed the criminal citation C8789 for
               Obstructing a public servant, I explained the citation to her.
               Sgt. Larsen advised he would release her so I could contact
               Cahill and determine if she needed any other assistance. While
               I was talking with Cahill, Sgt. Larsen attempted to escort
               Dixon out of the processing room. Dixon became uncooperative
               with Larsen and he had to physically remove her from the
               processing room and walk her to the exit of Martin Stadium. The
               entire contact, Dixon was extremely uncooperative and
               disrespectful. I did not have a body camera during this contact
               because they were all issued to other teams for the football
               game. I asked York and Thorgrimson to complete statements
               regarding their involvement in the incident which were added to
               the case file on 113014. Nothing further. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               1st day of December, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               Conduct NARRATIVE: On 11/29/14 at about 2355 I was dispatched
               to a call at Rogers Hall Pullman, WA of possible Marijuana use
               in room 1121. I went to the 11th floor of Rogers Hall and was
               met by the reporting party resident advisor Brittany A Griffin
               (DOB 072689). She pointed out a male walking down the hall and
               said that he was the resident of room 1121. I contacted the
               male James B. Waid and asked him which room was his, he stated
               he lived in room 1121. I followed him down the hallway to his
               room and we stopped out front of the door to 1121. The door to
               his room was opened and I could smell a strong odor of
               marijuana coming from inside his room. I asked him what was
               going and he stated nothing was going on. Officer Stewart asked
               if he had a medical marijuana card. Waid said that he did not.
               Officer Stewart asked if anyone else was in the room and Waid
               said there was. A female, Avery L. Bird (DOB 041596) came out
               of the room. Then Stewart asked if he had any illegal drugs or
               drug paraphernalia in his room. Waid said he did not. Stewart
               told him we could smell the marijuana and he had two options.
               He could bring out all of the illegal drugs and drug
               paraphernalia and destroy them and have the case forwarded to
               student conduct or the second option was we could apply for a
               search warrant for the room, and he would possibly face
               criminal charges and student conduct. Waid said he wanted to
               take the first option and destroy the illegal drugs and drug
               paraphernalia. Waid stated all of the marijuana and
               paraphernalia was his. Waid had a jar with two marijuana stems
               in it and a small glass pipe. Waid destroyed both items.
