               approximately 0805 hours, I was dispatched to a report of a hit
               and run collision in the parking lot of Smith Gym. Upon
               arrival, I contacted Joshua Pietz who told me his wife parked
               their car in the parking lot and at approximately 0745 hours, a
               black Dodge pickup backed into their car as it was backing out
               of it's parking stall. I took pictures of the damage to Pietz'
               vehicle and noted that there was paint scratching and dents
               above the driver's side rear wheel well. I estimated the cost
               of the damage at approximately $1000.00. Pietz told me that
               there was a construction worker who took a picture of the black
               Dodge pickup before it drove away and sent it to him. Pietz
               emailed me the picture. At approximately 0845 hours, Asa G. K.
               Palagi came to the WSU Police Department to report a non-injury
               collision. Asa admitted to causing the collision with Pietz'
               vehicle. Asa stated he was parked next to Pietz' vehicle and as
               he tried to back out of the stall, his tires slid on the ice
               and the bed of his pickup slid into Pietz' vehicle. Asa told me
               he didn't know what to do, so he when home, got his stuff ready
               for class and then drove to the WSU Police Department to report
               the collision. Asa told me that his insurance is through State
               Farm (1691786D0147), and he has already filed a claim. He asked
               me to give Pietz the claim number (473W89769) for his insurance
               and to call their number 1-855-341-8184. I emailed Pietz the

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 02-25-14 at about 1444 hours I was
               dispatched to the report of malicious mischief. The RP, Bill
               Morris, was in the WSUPD lobby for contact. I contacted Morris
               and went to the interview room to talk with him. I asked him to
               explain what was going on and he told me the following; he said
               that for the last 2 years he has been harassed by a co-worker,
               Eric Urban. Morris showed me notes that he has taken of several
               different incidents that have taken place since November 2013.
               His notes indicate the following interactions between him and
               Urban... 11-4-13 9:30AM Eric tried to hit my work rig with his
               on Grimes Way in front of French Ad - Doug Hayes, Witness 11-
               20-13 1:45PM Eric Urban stuck his head in my office & glanced
               at me for 2 minutes, then left and was hollaring cry baby
               through the door loud enough for Doug H. & Tim L. to hear and
               myself, when Doug and I walked out to our vehicle, Eric had the
               door to the shop open making "jacking off" gestures toward us.
               12-16-13 Monday 1:00PM was told by Tim L. that Larry Marshall
               was asked by Eric Urban if he wanted to smoke a bowl of weed
               while giving Eric a ride to motor pool to retrieve Eric's truck
               01-23-14 Was told by John B. that Eric Urban was smoking pot in
               parking lot at end of shift 4:30PM. Jim Antione also a witness
               to seeing Eric smoke pot. 02-06-14 Was approached by Jon
               Baldwin, he was clearly upset. Eric had been bullying him in
               the utility shop, "staring at him" said it made him real
               uncomfortable, also Jon told me of Eric backing out of Old
               Bookie parking garage at a high rate of speed colliding with a
               student in a CRV Honda, hit so hard it snapped the spindle off
               on the CRV. Then Jim & John were driving by and Eric flagged
               them down, he wanted them to take the blame for hitting the
               girls CRV. Jon said this happened a year ago. 02-11-14 7:53AM
               was called by Jim Antione to attent safety meeting. I told him
               that to many safety items were being swept under the rug, that
               I would not be there, I dont want to be apart of all that. Eric
               Urban then got on the radio and said "Waa!" and it just so
               happened that he was driving by my shop "Transformer Storage"
               and he made a lude gesture by raising his middle finger at me.
               02-24-14 5:30AM Got to work @ 5:30AM, found someone had broke
               into my tool box on my work truck and removed my dewalt bit

               kit, smahed the case and then it in the back of my pickup "work
               truck" along with an extension cord that had been stolen months
               ago, the cord & case were thrown into a bucket that came from
               surplus, old food service bucket. Nothing stolen just
               vandalized again! My suspicion is Eric Urban was retaliating
               because I had the man door blocked to the other part of the
               shed. Eric has been kicked out of 2 different van pools because
               of drinking, Rick Magers * Larry & Jackie Marshel. On a
               separate note Morris wrote the following notes: 1) Banana peels
               on my windshield 2) Wrote 2 times Pig in grease on w.s. 3) Put
               a hand drawn pic under w.s. on wiper 4) put rags on cat.
               converter 5) smokes pot at work (Alan to Greg) 6) Dented his
               rig many times 7) Ran over my cones on Grimes 8) Harassing me -
               if I had gone to HRS - then called me a cry baby 9) brags about
               being untouchable I spoke with Morris about these incidents. He
               told me many times that he feels like he's being "picked on"
               because he is not conforming to the way Eric wants him to act.
               He told me that he feels like it is a safety issue having Eric
               at work because of his drug and alcohol use. Morris also told
               me that he went to HRS with is concerns last fall,sometime
               around September or Ocotober 2013. He said he spoke with
               Sabrina McPherson and she only provided him with information
               about the Employee Assistance Program. Morris was upset by this
               and says that he felt like HRS was telling him that this was
               all his fault and that he needed counseling, rather than
               addressing the issue with Urban. Morris then told me that he
               feels like his direct boss, Greg Streva, is part of the
               problem. He said that he has gone to Streva with his concerns
               but Streva just "sweeps it under the rug". While Morris spoke
               with me he seemed very frustrated with the situation. I asked
               him what he would ultimately like to see done. He said that he
               wants Eric fired. I told Morris that I did not have the
               authority to do that. He then said he wants Eric to just leave
               him alone. I asked Morris if he wanted me to speak with Eric
               about his behavior and he said yes but that it also "needed to
               go higher than that". Morris then explained to me that he wants
               the FacOps Directors (Dan Costello and Chris Fischer) contacted
               and notified of what's going on. I asked Morris if he has any
               problems with anybody else at work and he said no. He said he's
               been there for 18 years and its only been in the last 2 years
               that he has had any problems with Eric. I told Morris that I
               would review his notes and start contacting some of the people
               he identified. I also spoke with Morris about obtaining a
               protection order. He said he would look into it. On 02-26-14 at
               about 0930 hours I spoke to Sabrina McPherson at HRS. I asked
               her about the information she had about Bill Morris and Eric
               Urban. She told me that on October 7, 2013 Morris came in to
               her office and spoke with her about concerns he had regarding a
               co-worker, Eric Urban. She said that Morris told her that he
               was being harassed and that Urban would taunt him. She said
               that he brought several examles (the list about banana peels)
               but had not dates, only that this was happening over the course
               of the last 2 years. McPherson told me that she spoke with
               Morris and Urban's supervisor, Greg Streva. She said that
               Streva then had a conversation with Urban about his behavior,

               which he apparently admitted to. McPherson told me that was the
               last she knew of the situation and asked if there has been
               anything happen since her meeting with Morris. I told her that
               Morris came in yesterday and had documented 7 different
               incidents that had occurred since November 2013. I also told
               McPherson that Morris thinks Streva is part of the problem and
               that talking to him will not get any results. McPherson agreed
               that we should both meet with Chris Fischer, Maintenance
               Supervisor, to discuss the issue. I told McPherson that I would
               set up a time with Fischer where we could all meet in her
               office. At about 1000 hours I called Fischer and left him a
               voicemail message asking him to return my call. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               problem with an independent contractor in San Francisco. The

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 022514 around 1644 hrs I was
               dispatched to a reported theft from 2025 NE Terre View Dr,
               apartment D8. I contacted the reporting party, later identified
               as Amanuel K Moges (083093) and told the following. Moges
               explained that he sells items over the internet, and had
               contracted an independent contractor to sell some items over
               craigslist in San Francisco. According to Moges, he entered
               into a contractual agreement with an individual named Yohance R
               Chism, who resides at 1118 Ingerson Ave San Francisco, Ca. to
               sell some items. He had Chism fill out the necessary W-9
               paperwork as well as written contracts, which he had signed and
               returned to Moges. Moges went on to tell me he had sent some
               items to Chism and had not received any payment. When
               contacted, Chism explained that he had been robbed at gunpoint
               in San Francisco and had reported the incident to San Francisco
               Police Department (SFPD). Moges later learned that this was not
               true and had contacted SFPD to report the theft of the items
               and was told he wanted to get a case number for the theft. We
               discussed this at length and the fact that he had entered into
               a civil contract with Chism. I asked Mogues to send me copies
               of the information he had and provided him with a case number
               for his complaint for SFPD. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               25th day of February, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               ____NO OTHER UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 022614 around 1756 hrs I
               was dispatched to a report of a hit and run collision which had
               occurred around 1700 hrs on 022514 on Nevada St near Stadium
               Wy. I contacted the reporting party, later identified as
               Anayssa Pulido Sanchez (052692) and was told the following.
               Anayssa explained that around 1700 hrs she had been driving
               east on Washington St until turning onto Nevada St where she
               had to wait for traffic. As she waited she told me that a
               greenish/grey colored SUV (Wa. AGV7405) tried to pull around
               the right side of her car and struck the passenger side rear
               quarter panel causing her car to shift its weight. The result
               caused damage to her vehicle and she went on to say that after
               the vehicle had passed her she noted the license plate, which
               she provided to me. When asked where the vehicle had gone after
               striking her vehicle she told me it had turned at the
               intersection of Stadium Wy and Nevada heading towards East Main
               St where she eventually lost sight of it. I asked her if she
               could meet me at the WSU Police Department so I could see the
               damage and obtain her information from her. She agreed and a
               short time later I met with her. Upon speaking with Anayssa I
               was shown the damage which had been caused as a result of the
               collision to the rear quarter panel and I could see a small
               dent, which I estimated to be around $50.00. Upon seeing the
               damage I asked her if she thought the other driver might have
               not even been aware of the collision and was told she thought
               it might be possible. I photographed the damage and provided
               her with my business card and case number for reference before
               she left. A short time later I contacted Nedra K Murray, whom
               the vehicle license that Anayssa came back to returned to. Upon
               speaking with her I asked if she owned an SUV and had driven on
               Nevada St towards Stadium Wy around 1700 hrs today. She told me
               she had and I asked if she had pulled around a vehicle while
               trying to get into the right turn lane, which she also told me
               she had. When I asked her if she had struck another car she
               told me she didn't believe that she had, but later told me she
               had struck the curb at one point. I asked if I could look at
               her vehicle and made arrangements to meet at her home a short
               time later. Upon speaking with her I looked at her vehicle and

               noted one small paint chip on the drivers side quarter panel
               which matched the height of Anayssa's vehicle. Upon closer
               inspection I could see the are was covered with dirt and aside
               from the chip mark did not appear to have been disturbed. I
               examined the reminder of the front and drivers side quarter
               panel of the vehicle and saw no other damage which would have
               matched the damage to Anayssa's vehicle. I photographed the
               damage and obtained her information before giving her my
               business card along with the case number for reference. I also
               provided Murray with Anayssa's contact number in case she
               wished to contact her to resolve this matter and cleared a
               short time later. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 25th day of
