               hours I was sent an email from Assistant Chief Hansen that he
               had received from the Director of Student Media, Candace Baltz.
               The email included concerns that were expressed to her about a
               tweet that was sent to the Daily Evergreen earlier in the day.
               She said that some editors had seen the tweet and felt like it
               crossed the line and was threatening in nature, since it
               mentioned the name of a columist. After reviewing the tweet,
               which was sent from user "WSU Prof", it appeared as if the
               tweet was only a opinion and not directly threatening to
               anybody. The tweet said "@DailyEvergreen But if Abby Student
               like it up the #ass, that's her business. #anal" I called Baltz
               to talk with her about the concerns of her employees. She said
               they were worried because this tweet crossed the line. I
               explained to her that although the tweet is "tasteless" it
               appeared to be only an opinion. She agreed and said she would
               talk with her employees. I asked Baltz if they knew who the
               user was that made the tweet. She said no. Based on the content
               of the message I have sent this report to the Office of Equal
               Opportunity. A copy of the tweet has been added to the Spillman
               Files. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the
               laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 20th day of February, 2014, in Pullman,

               February 2014 at about 1625 hours, Magan Turner arrived at WSU
               PD. Turner stated she had been sexually assaulted by Marlon
               Onan Lopez-Cabrera on the morning of April 29 2013. Turner
               stated she had met Lopez-Cabrera at flix on the WSU campus.
               They started a romantic relationship. During this time Lopez-
               Cobrera would try to pressure Turner into having sex with him
               and Turner would refuse. Turner stated they broke-up just prior
               to Spring Break. Following spring break Turner and Lopez-
               Cobrera would continue to see each other. On the evening of 28
               April 2013, Turner went to Lopez-Cobrera's room, Goldsworthy
               Hall Room 110, to watch movies. Turner said it got late so she
               stayed in the room with Lopez-Cobrera to sleep and Lopez-
               Cobrera's roomate was also in the room. Truner stated she and
               Lopez-Cobrera were in the same bed. Turner stated they were
               kissing and Lopez-Cobrera was trying to take off her cloths.
               Turner kept telling Lopez-Cobrera no. Lopez-Cobrera asked why
               and Turner replied to him she was waiting till marriage or when
               she knew it was the right person. Lopez-Cobrera contined to try
               and change Turner's mind but she wouldn't change her mind and
               Lopez-Cobrera finally quit. They fell asleep then. The next
               morning they woke up and Lopez-Cobrera was kissing Turner.
               Turner stated Lopez-Cobrera took her cloths off even though she
               tried to resist him. She stated Lopez-Cobrera then tried to
               have sexual intercourse with her by trying to put his penis
               into her vagina. Turner would try and cover her vagina with her
               hands to prevent Lopez-Cabrera from entering her. Lopez-Cobrera
               would reach down and grab her hands and put them up by her
               head. He would try and push his penis into Turner's vagina and
               she was saying no and tried to move her body. She was telling
               him she did not want this and he would push harder. She tried
               to push him back but he would mot move and eventually she felt
               his penis in her vagina. At this point Turner felt she had lost
               and just let the assault happen. She asked Lopez-Cabrera if he
               knew when to pull out so she wouldn't get pregnant and he
               replied he did know. Turner stated Lopez-Cobrera finally

               having sex with him. After Lopez-Cobrera was done he left
               Turner's room and went back to his own room. Later Lopez-
               Cobrera told Turner a friend would take her to Safeway to get
               Plan B because he was worried that she would get pregnant.

               Goldsworthy. Turner said Lopez-Cobrera want the plan B box.
               Turner asked Lopez-Cobrera why he wanted the box and he replied
               memories. Turner kept the box because she wanted to read it.
               Upon returning to Goldsworthy Turner returned to her room.

               received an email from Shannon Normandin, who is the Cougar
               Security Captain. In the email she attached an email sent to
               Cougar Security regarding a possible homeless woman who was
               seen in Albrook. I reviewed the email which stated the
               following. "From: Haight, Tim <tim.haight@wsu.edu> Sent:
               Wednesday, February 19, 2014 4:54 PM To: Police.CougarSecurity
               Subject: Homeless Woman Trespassing in Albrook Yesterday at 4pm
               there was a homeless woman who was in Albrook. I saw her
               sitting on the stairs. A coworker, Rani Muthukrishnan saw her
               as well. A little while later, Sheri Glaesman saw her in the
               downstairs restroom. According to Sheri "When she came out I
               asked if I could help her find someone and she said "I was just
               leaving" and she left. I had to take the fan down and prop the
               door to air out the whole basement." According to Rani (this
               was before I got here) "Two years back, a drifter came to our
               office requesting for some access to tools or maps as he was a
               USGS field worker and had lost something. Lisa and I came to
               realize this after he had walked off. Lisa then called the
               campus police, they were very unhappy that we had volunteered
               ANY information at all. I mean really, really, unhappy." We are
               concerned because our office is the Office of Research
               Assurances, and we want to make sure we don't get animal
               protestors or other nut jobs in our office. What should be we
               do in the future? *********************************************

               Upon reviewing the email I passed this information along to
               patrol and requested an extra patrol of the area, as well as
               notifying Cougar Security to check the area during their
               patrols. In addition I responded to Haight's email and sent a

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 02/21/14 at approximately 0220 hours
               I was driving eastbound on Terre View near the Chief Joseph
               Apartments when I noticed a silver Cadillac sedan heading
               eastbound in front of me. The Cadillac was driving
               approximately 5 MPH under the speed limit and was drifting
               slowly to the curb. The section of Terre View that the Cadillac
               was driving on is wide enough to accommodate four lanes of
               travel however there is only one each direction. When the
               Cadillac reached the intersection of Terre View and North
               Fairway, the driver slowed but over shot his turn causing him
               to sharply turn right when he turned onto North Fairway. The
               way the driver was driving was out of the ordinary. I ran the
               license plate of the vehicle on my vehicle's computer. The
               license plate came back expired as of October 2013. I initiated
               a traffic stop at North Fairway and the Student Rec Center. I
               contacted the driver, Mahmood A. Almakhamil, identified myself,
               informed the driver I was recording, and explained the reason
               for the stop. Almakhamil stated he knew his tabs were expired.
               Almakhamil said his father had died earlier in 2013 and
               Almakhamil had just returned to the United States from Saudi
               Arabia in January. When Almkahamil spoke his words were
               slurred. Almakhamil does have a strong accent, however I have
               spoken with Almakhamil in the past and his speech was much
               better then. As I stood at the driver's side window I could
               smell the odor of intoxicants coming from the car. I asked
               Almakhamil how much he had to drink and he said none. I asked
               Almakhamil if I could check his eyes and he said I could. I
               told Almakhamil to keep his head still and follow the tip of my
               finger with his eyes only. As soon as I moved my finger
               Almakhamil moved his head to follow my finger. I reminded
               Almakhamil to keep his head still and I tried the test again.
               During the test I observed, lack of smooth pursuit and distinct
               and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation. Almakahmil was
               also guessing where I was going to move my finger instead of
               following it as instructed. I told Almakahmil that I did not
               believe that he had not drank and again asked how much he had
               to drink tonight. Almakahmil turned to his passenger and asked

               her how much he drank. Almakahmil turned back to me after a few
               seconds and said one beer. Without prompt, Almakahmil said, "I
               can do any test you guys want me to do." I asked Almakahmil if
               he was willing to do some voluntary field sobriety tests and he
               said he would. The tests were conducted on a sidewalk in the
               SRC parking lot. The sidewalk had a slight grade to it.
               Almakahmil was wearing a jacket, tee shirt, jeans, and
               basketball style shoes at the time of the tests. The sidewalk
               was lit by street lights, patrol car spot light, and personal
               flashlight. I explained to Almakahmil that I would be
               evaluating him on how well he followed my instructions as well
               as how well he performed the tests. The first test I
               administered was the HGN test. I instructed Almakahmil to stand
               with his heels and toes together and keep his arms at his
               sides. I told Almakahmil to remain in that position while I
               administered the test. Almakahmil stated he understood. I told
               Almakahmil to follow the tip of my pen with his eyes only and
               not to move his head. I held my pen approximately 12-15 inches
               away from Almakahmil's head. During the test Almakahmil was
               swaying side to side as he stood before me. While administering
               the test I observed, equal pupil size, equal tracking, lack of
               smooth pursuit, and distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum
               deviation. While Almakahmil was following my pen he again was
               guessing where it was going to go instead of following it as
               instructed. The next test I administered was the walk and turn.
               I told Almakahmil to place his left foot on an imaginary line
               before him. I then instructed Almakahmil to place his right
               foot heel to toe in front of his left foot and keep his arms at
               his side. I had to explain to Almakahmil a few times to put his
               feet as I was demonstrating. Almakahmil got into the starting
               position as instructed. I told Almakahmil to remain in that
               position as I gave further instructions. I told Almakahmil,
               when I tell you to begin, don't begin until I tell you, you
               will take a series of nine heel to toe steps down the line,
               with your arms at your side, looking down at your feet, and
               counting your steps out loud. Once you reach your ninth step
               leave your lead foot planted and with your rear foot take a
               series of small steps until you are facing where you came from
               and again take nine return heel to toe steps. I demonstrated
               the test for Almakahmil. I reminded Almakahmil to keep his arms
               at his side, count his steps out loud, look down at his feet,
               and do not stop the test until he had completed it. I asked
               Almakahmil if he understood and Almakahmil said he did. I told
               Almakahmil he could begin as soon as he was ready. Instruction
               Phase: Almakahmil lost his balance twice and stepped out of the
               starting position. First Nine Steps: On Almakahmil's first 9
               steps, Almakahmil stepped off line and missed heel to toe on
               steps, 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 12. Almakahmil was making so many
               mistakes I was unable to write them all down. Almakahmil took a
               total of 14 steps before stopping and turning around.
               Almakahmil turned around by pivoting on the balls of his feet.
               Return Nine Steps: On Almakahmil's return steps he again was
               missing heel to toe on the majority of his steps and I was
               unable to record all of them. Amakahmil never looked down as he
               feet while walking. The next test I administered was the One

               Leg Stand. I instructed Amakahmil to stand with his heels and
               toes together and keep his arms at his side. I told Amakahmil
               to remain in that position while I gave him further
               instructions. I told Amakahmil, when I tell you to begin, don't
               begin until I tell you, you will raise either leg of your
               choice and raise it six inches off the ground. You must point
               your toe so the sole of your shoe is parallel with the ground.
               While pointing your toe, keep your arms at your side, leg
               straight, look down at your foot and count out loud, one
               thousand one, one thousand two, one thousand three, and so on
               until I tell you to stop. If at any point you put your foot
               down, go ahead and pick it right back up and continue counting
               where ever you left off. I demonstrated the test and asked
               Amakahmil if he understood and he stated yes. I told Amakahmil
               to begin whenever he was ready. During the instruction phase,
               Almakahmil started the test before I instructed twice. Once I
               told Almakahmil to start he raised his right leg and began
               counting. When Almakahmil reached 11 he lost his balance and
               put his foot down. Almakahmil picked up his foot but had to
               immediately put his foot back down for balance. Almakahmil only
               counted to 12 in the 30 seconds. I told Amakahmil that the last
               test I had for him was the PBT. I explained what the PBT was,
               that it was voluntary, and it did not replace the evidentiary
               breath test. I found my PBT (Alco-Sensor FST #16805) in working
               condition. When Almakahmil started to provide a PBT sample he
               was barely blowing into the breath tube. After about a second I
               had to manually click the PBT because Almakahmil was not
               blowing properly. I obtained a weak reading of .135 on the PBT.
               I told Almakahmil that he was under arrest for DUI and
               handcuffed (D/L) him. I advised Almakahmil of his right to
               counsel and walked Almakahmil over to my patrol car where he
               was searched incident to arrest. Nothing of evidentiary value
               was found. I placed Almakahmil in the back seat of my patrol
               car. I told Almakahmil that his vehicle was going to be towed
               and wanted to know if there was anything in the car he wanted
               out of it. Almakahmil asked for his cell phone. About this time
               Sgt. Griffin arrived on scene and he stayed with the vehicle
               and I transported Almakahmil to Pullman Police Department for
               BAC. Upon arrival I checked the Datamaster and found it working
               properly, with the RFI antenna attached, the mouth tube warm to
               the touch, and a temperature within ranges. At 0254 hours I
               checked Almakahmil's mouth finding no foreign substances. I
               read Almakahmil his Constitutional Rights at 0256 hours.
               Almakahmil stated he understood his rights and signed he
               understood his rights and decided not to exercise his rights. I
               read Almakahmil the Implied Consent Warning for Breath and
               Almakahmil said he did not understand and asked me to speak
               more slowly. I reread the Implied Consent Warning but
               Almakahmil said he did not fully understand how DUI works in
               Washington. I asked Almakahmil if he would like to speak with
               an attourny who could better explain it. Almakahmil said he
               would. I called public defender Mark Monson at approximately
               0315 hours. Almakahmil spoke to Monson for about 20 minutes.
               Once Almakahmil was done Almakahmil said he did not know what
               to do. I told Almakahmil he could provide a sample or not.

               Almakahmil said he did not want to and was "refusing." I told
               Almakahmil that I would be applying for a warrant. I placed
               Almakahmil in a holding cell and returned to my station. I
               applied and was granted a blood search warrant (SW022114A) by
               Judge Robinson. At 0505 hours I returned to the Holding
               Facility and transported Almakahmil to Pullman Regional
               Hospital for the blood draw. I provided the phlebotomist
               (Jenavee Smith) with the blood draw kit. I watched as Smith
               swabbed the crook of Almakahmil's left arm with 10% Providone
               Iodine. I watched as Smith drew blood into a syringe and then
               transferred the blood into the two grey top vials. Smith
               labeled vials and gave the blood draw kit back to me.
               Almakahmil blood was taken at 0525 hours. Almakahmil's blood
               was taken 2 hours and 56 minutes after Almakahmil had stopped
               driving. I transported Almakahmil back to the Holding Facility
               where I fingerprinted and photographed Almakahmil. I provided
               Almakahmil a copy of the following documents: Notice of
               Hearing/Conditions of Release, tow and impound form, and the
               breath test document. Almakahmil was released at 0605 hours.
               The blood kit was logged into evidence and will be sent to the
               state crime lab for analysis. Pending the results of the blood,
               charges of RCW 46.61.502 will be forwarded to the prosecutor.
               Almakahmil's vehicle was impounded by Myer's Towing for 12
               hours. My VieVu camera footage was uploaded to the department's
               computer. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 21st day of February, 2014, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer
