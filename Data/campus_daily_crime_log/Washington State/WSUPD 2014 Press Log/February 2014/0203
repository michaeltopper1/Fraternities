               SYNOPSIS: Hit and run collision Nevada Street near Olympia Ave.
               DRIVER 1: Unknown VEHICLE 1: Unknown INSURANCE: Unknown DAMAGE:
               Unknown DRIVER 2: Legally parked, unoccupied. VEHICLE 2:
               ACB0197/WA, 2007 Honda Accord, two door, blue in color.
               INSURANCE: N/A DAMAGE: Driver's side rear bumper pulled from
               fender. Estimated damage at $600.00 WITNESS(ES): None
               NARRATIVE: On February 3, 2014 at about 1417 hours I was
               dispatched to a hit and run collision near the intersection of
               Nevada and Olympia. I responded to the area where I met the
               complainant, Francisco J. Mendoza Jr. (10/26/94). He told me he
               last saw his vehicle not damaged at about 2130 hours on
               February, 2, 2014. When he came out at the time of call he
               found it damaged. The vehicle was legally parked in the Gray
               permit parking on the west side of Nevada. Olympia Avenue has a
               steep grade that intersects at this location. There was snow
               and ice overnight causing multiple collisions in this area.
               Vehicles attempting to drive down the hill were sliding into
               parked vehicles at the bottom. No note was left on his vehicle.
               It is unknown who or what struck the vehicle. Digital photos
               were taken. I provided Mendoza the case number for insurance
               purposes. No further investigation at this time. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               3rd day of February, 2014 in Pullman, Washington.

               was dispatched to a report of a possible computer hacking case.
               I contacted the reporting party, later identified as Zishen Ye
               (021591) and was told the following. Ye explained that he
               believed that someone had hacked into his gmail and zzusis
               accounts on 013014 and had altered his zzusis account to show
               withdraw him from classes. He went on to tell me that he
               received an email from a professor asking him about his
               intention to withdraw, at which time he believed his account
               had been hacked. We discussed this issue and after some time Ye
               explained that he never lets anyone use his phone or accounts,
               but that his mother does have his passwords. He went on to
               explain that he had recently used the computers at Holland
               library, and when he does he has not been signing out of his
               accounts, but simply exiting from them. He told me after a
               moment that someone could have used the system after him and
               would have had access to his accounts at that point. I asked if
               any of his information had been changed on his gmail account or
               if he had any other passwords saved to various files. He told
               me they had not and he was going to change them after he
               finished speaking with me. We continued speaking and he told me
               the registration issue had been taken care of as well as
               changing his passwords for both his gmail and zzusis accounts.
               I gave him my business card and told him to contact me if he
               noticed any other problems with his accounts and was told he
               would. Nothing further at this time. I certify and declare

               020314 around 2042 hrs I was dispatched to a report of the odor
               of marijuana coming from room 815 of Stephenson North. Upon my
               arrival I noticed a faint odor of burnt marijuana coming from
               around the closed door of room 815 and upon knocking the door
               was answered by a female, later identified as Anjelica Reyna
               (082995). I asked if she knew why I there and she looked at and
               the floor, and began breathing heavily, before nodding her head
               and telling me she did. When asked why I was there she told me
               because they had been smoking marijuana. I explained that was
               correct and we had a brief discussion before I was told that
               she and her roommate, later identified as Sandra E Larios
               (060195), had smoked a small amount of marijuana in the room
               from a joint. When asked about how much they had left Larious
               explained they had one joint and small amount. We discussed
               several options at this point and I was told they wished to
               voluntarily destroy the remainder marijuana. I escorted both
               Reyna and Larious to the bathroom where I watched them destroy
               the remainder of their marijuana and gave them a warning before
               I cleared. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 3rd day of February,
               2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               was dispatched to a report of the odor of marijuana coming from
               room 349 of Stimson Hall. Ofc Westerman and I responded and
               upon our arrival I knocked on the door to room 349. As the
               resident, later identified as Devron J Gray (012595), of the
               room opened the door I immediately noticed the odor of
               marijuana coming from within the room. I asked Gray if he knew
               why we were contacting him and he told us yes. As he began to
               tell us it was for the odor of marijuana I noticed his eyes
               were bloodshot red, which based upon my training and experience
               is an indicator of someone having smoked marijuana. We
               continued to speak about at which time he told us he had not
               smoked the marijuana in the room, but had rolled a joint and
               went outside to smoke it, but the odor must have followed him
               back inside. We spoke for some time before Gray told us he
               would be willing to destroy the remaining marijuana. We agreed
               and followed Gray to the dumpster where we watched him destroy
               the remaining marijuana and paraphernalia before we gave him a
               warning and cleared. Nothing further. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
