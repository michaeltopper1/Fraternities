               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 02/23/14 at approximately 0920 hours
               I was dispatched to an agency assist for a collision on SR 270
               near MP 7. Washington State Patrol (WSP) dispatch requested
               Whitman County Sheriff's Office (WCSO) respond. WCSO was not in
               the area and asked if I could respond. I told WCSO that I would
               respond and handle the collision. Upon arrival I found a black
               BMW (R544WSU WA) facing north in the ditch on the north side of
               the roadway. At the time of the collision there was snow and
               slush on the roadway and it was snowing heavily. The outside
               temperature was approximately 29 degrees and traffic was light.
               I noticed two subjects in the vehicle and they got out. I asked
               if anyone was injured and they said no, and there were no
               apparent injuries. I told Whitcom they could cancel medics. I
               asked who was driver and a subject, identified by WADL as
               Tatton M. Hymas 06/15/83, said he was. The passenger was
               identified by WADL as Matthew R. Birch 08/08/89. Hymas advised
               he had already contacted a tow out of Moscow. Hymas said he was
               traveling westbound when he lost control of his vehicle.
               Judging by the tire marks in the snow this is an accurate
               story. There were tire marks (four) leading from the outside
               lane to the north, and into the ditch. The vehicle did not spin
               and continued to travel in same northwesterly direction until
               it jumped a ditch and came to a stop against an embankment. I
               remained on scene until the tow arrived (Auto Body
               Supercenter). There was damage to the front bumper and the left
               side of the rear bumper. The front bumper was able to be
               reattached, but the grill area and the fog lights will have to
               be replaced. I photographed the damage and saved it to the
               case. I noticed the front tires had sufficient tread, but the
               back tires' tread was low. I advised the driver since it was a
               rear wheel drive vehicle he sould probably get the rear tires
               replaced. The vehicle was removed from the ditch and able to be
               driven away. I completed a SECTOR PTCR and attached it to the
               case. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the
               laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 23rd day of February, 2014, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer

               the reporting party, Kaitelynn M Piazza 04/07/94, and asked
               what happened. Piazza (The RA) said that on room 324 there were
               door decorations with the word "gay" written on it. I went to
               the room and noticed several of the door decorations had "gay"
               written on it. It appeared the handwriting was from a female.
               The occupant of the room, Joshua Vizcaya, was not home. I asked
               Piazza if she knew if Vizcaya was aware of the writing and she
               said she did not know, but she attempted to contact him. I

               NARRATIVE: On 02-23-14, at approximately 1649 hours, I was
               dispatched to a suicide attempt. Palouse River Counseling
               called Whitcom and notified them a female, Jennifer M. Spadoni,
               had called them and said she wanted to end her life. Whitcom
               said Spadoni was on foot and believed she was on Spokane Street
               near Stadium Way. The said she Spadoni was wearing a bright
               blue coat. Sgt. Jacobson, Officer Jones, and I responded to the
               area of Spokane Street. Officer Jones contacted Spadoni first
               and then I began talking with her. She said she was not
               prescribed any current medication, but had taken approximately
               10 Excedrin pills throughout the day. She said she wasn't even
               sure what was wrong, but she just wanted to take some pills, go
               to sleep, and never wake up. She said she has had these
               feelings since 02-20-14, but said nothing happened to trigger
               these feelings. I asked her if she was seeing a counselor and
               she said she is in her 5th year of school in Pullman. She said
               she had been seen by a WSU Counselor in the past, but felt like
               they just rushed students in and out and did not really care
               about them. I asked her if she had ever been prescribed any
               medication by a counselor and she said she had during her
               Sophomore year, but did not like the way the pills "Did not
               allow her to feel", so she stopped taking them. I asked her if
               she would be willing to let me transport her to Pullman
               Regional Hospital so I could have a mental health counselor
               come and speak with her. She said that would be fine. I
               transported her to PRH and signed her into Protective Custody.
               She was left in the care of the PRH Emergency Room staff. I
               sent this case to WSU Counseling Services on 02-24-14. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under

               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W0753 SYNOPSIS: I responded to
               Pullman Regional Hospital to interview the victim, Dawit Kelete

               0030 and 0100 on 02-23-14. It was determined the assault
               occurred in the City of Pullman's jurisdiction. I notified
               Whitcom and asked them to send a City of Pullman Police Officer
               to interview Kelete. The case was sent to the WSU Office for
               Equal Opportunity. NAME/DOB: CITE/SECTOR#: OFFENSE: REFERRALS:

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 02-23-14, I was dispatched to Pullman
               Regional Hospital to interview Dawit Kelete about an assault
               which occurred sometime between the hours of 0030 and 0100 on
               02-23-14. When I arrived at PRH, I observed Kelete had two
               black eyes, which were both swollen and a cut on the left side
               of his nose. I asked him to tell me what he could remember
               about the assault. Kelete said he was walking with one white
               friend and one black friend when several white males in drove
               by them in a white truck. Kelete said the males yelled
               something to the effect of "Hey Nigger" to them as they drove
               by. Kelete said he yelled something to the effect of "Fuck You"
               to them. Kelete is a black male. Kelete said the White truck
               pulled over and parked in a parking lot. He said the males then
               ran over to him and began hitting him and he fell to the
               ground. He said once he fell to the ground the males continued
               kicking him. He said his friends tried to intervene and help
               him, but the white males continued hitting and kicking him. At
               this point he said he had been walking on "B" Street near
               California Street. This area is in the City of Pullman's Police
               Department jurisdiction so I called Whitcom and asked them to
               send a City of Pullman Police Officer to PRH so they could
               interview Kelete and take the case. I cleared with no further
               action. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 23rd day of February, 2014, in Pullman,

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On February 24, 2014 at approximately
               2220 hours I was dispatched to a drugs call at Stimson Hall
               room 7. I called the Reporting Party, Aubrie L. Piper, who is
               the Hall Director on Duty. Piper said she was notified of the
               drugs call by an RA that lives in room 5. Room 5 and 7 share a
               bathroom that is accessible from the interior of both rooms.
               The RA in room 5 called RED Piper who responded. Piper stated
               that there was a very strong odor of marijuana coming from room
               7 via the shared bathroom. I asked Piper how she knew the odor
               of marijuana. Piper stated she has attended at least 8
               controlled marijuana burns with the last one being August of
               2013. I asked Piper, on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being 100%
               certain, how sure are you that the odor is coming from room 7.
               Piper said she was a 10 out of 10. Piper also stated she was a
               10 out of 10 that the odor she smelled what in fact marijuana.
               Piper was able to tell me that room 7 is assigned to Joshua
               Caldwell Hart 08/07/95 who is 18 years old. I applied and was
               granted a search warrant for room 7 by Judge Robinson. At 2300
               hours, Ofc. Kirshner and I arrived at room 7. I knocked and
               announced twice but nobody came to the door. I keyed into the
               room and we found nobody inside. When we entered the room smell
               of burnt marijuana was overwhelming. I read the warrant to the
               empty room. Once the warrant was read, the search started.
               During the search the following items were located: -Spring
               assisted knife -Glass meth pipe -Plastic Bong -4 sandwich bags
               with small amounts of marijuana inside -Black digital scale
               with marijuana flakes on it -A fifth of Crown Royal Maple
               Whiskey -Metal cigarette roller with marijuana flakes in it I
               left a copy of the warrant and evidence log on Hart's bed. I
               locked Hart's room up and cleared. Once in the car I called
               Hart using the phone number listed for him in Spillman. A
               female answered who turned out to be his mother. I asked Hart's
               mother for his cell phone number and she stated she would call
               Hart and have him call me. I returned to the station and Hart
               called me about 10 minutes later. I asked Hart if he was

               willing to speak with me and he said he would. Hart agreed to
               meet me at the station. Hart arrived at the station at 0013
               hours. I took Hart into the interview room and told him that I
               would like to advise him of his rights. I read Hart his Miranda
               rights off the Constitutional Rights Wavier Form. Hart signed
               that he understood his rights and did not want to exercise them
               at this point. I asked Hart if he had a medical marijuana card
               and he said no but he was in the process of getting one. I
               asked Hart where in the process was he. Hart said he recently
               decided to get one but had not seen a doctor about it yet. I
               asked Hart if he had a chance to go to his room first before
               meeting me. Hart said he did and saw the list of items I took.
               With out prompt Hart brought up the meth pipe. Heart said he
               knows that the pipe looks like a meth pipe but he used it to
               smoke "wax." Wax is a slang term from the oils created by
               cooking down marijuana, similar to hash oil. I told Hart that I
               would not charge him with possession of paraphernalia if the
               pipe tested positive for marijuana. I tested the pipe for
               marijuana and did not get a positive indication for marijuana.
               I told Hart that it was not marijuana in the pipe and Hart
               swore that it was. I gave Hart several opportunities to tell me
               what was in the pipe and he continued to say it was "wax." I
               asked when the last time he smoked marijuana in his room. Hart
               said he smoked "wax" around 1900 hours in his room. Hart asked
               why I took his knife. I explained the spring assisted knife was
               classified as a dangerous weapon in Washington. Hart said he
               bought the knife in Spokane, WA. I told Hart that I could not
               speak to him buying it, only that it was illegal to possess. I
               told Hart that he was being charged for Possession of marijuana
               less than 40 grams, unlawful use of drug paraphernalia, MIP
               possession, and possession of dangerous weapon. I also told
               Hart that he was also under arrest for the 4 charges. I
               handcuffed (D/L) Hart and advised him of his right to counsel.
               I transported Hart to the Pullman Holding Facility where Hart
               was fingerprinted and photographed. I issued Hart Sector
               citation 4Z0255359 for all 4 charges. I explained the citation
               to Hart and provided him with his copy. I provided Hart a
               courtesy transport back to Stimson Hall. Once Hart was dropped
               off I cleared. Once back at the station, all seized items were
               logged into evidence. The marijuana was NIC tested showed
               presumptive positive for marijuana. The alcohol was
               photographed and poured out as Ofc. Boyd watched. A return of
               search was sent off to district court. My VieVu camera footage
               was uploaded to the department's computer. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 24th day of February, 2014, in Pullman,
