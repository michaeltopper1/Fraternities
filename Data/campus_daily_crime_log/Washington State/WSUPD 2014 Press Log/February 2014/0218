               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 021814 around 2036 hrs I was
               dispatched to a report of a lost Samsung Galaxy Note 3 cell
               phone. I contacted the reporting party, later identified as
               Kahealani M Alexander (013095) and was told the following.
               Alexander explained that she believes she had lost her Samsung
               Galaxy Note 3 cell phone in a taxi cab she had taken. She had
               contacted the cab company and after they had checked their
               vehicles she was told they had not located the phone. She went
               on to tell me she had checked everywhere else she could think
               of but that she was not able to locate the phone. I asked her
               if she had ever used the phone to connect to the WSU network,
               while on campus and she told me she did. I obtained her login
               information for Information Technology and asked if he had any
               tracking software on the phone. She told me the phone had not
               been active and she was unsure if she could lock the phone
               remotely. We spoke about this for a brief period of time before
               I asked if she knew the serial number for the phone. Initially
               she provided me with the number, but later emailed me with a
               correct IMEI number which was later added to this case
               (357518051971372). We discussed contacting her phone provider
               to report the phone missing and she told me she would once we
               concluded our call. Before completing this call I provided her
               with the case number and my information in the event she
               located the phone. I asked her to contact us in the event she
               located the phone and was told she would. Upon concluding our
               call a short time later I emailed Information Technology
               regarding the phone and asked them to track it. I also
               completed the stolen teletype form which was placed in the
               records box to be entered on 021914. Nothing further at this
               time. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the
               laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 19th day of February, 2014, in Pullman,

               __X__YES ____NO OTHER UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 02/18/14 at
               approximately 2346 hours, I was dispatched to a drugs call at
               Stephenson North room 929. I called the reporting party,
               Brittany A. Griffin, who was the RED on duty. Griffin said two
               RA's had located a room that smelled of marijuana. Griffin
               responded to room 929 but could only faintly smell the odor of
               marijuana coming from the room. Based on Griffin's uncertainty
               of the odor I did not pursue a warrant. Upon arrival I knocked
               on the door of room 929. Jackson Ross Slick 11/04/94 answered
               the door. When Slick opened the door I could clearly smell the
               odor of burnt marijuana coming from the room. I also could see,
               Blair Marshall Simpson 06/08/95 laying in bed. I told the two
               the reason I was contacting them and I needed their ID's. Both
               provided their WADL's. Both males were identified as under the
               age of 21. I asked both it they had a medical marijuana
               authorization. Slick said he did and I asked for it. Slick
               pulled a folded and very torn piece of paper from his wallet
               and handed it to me. The paper was a medical marijuana
               authorization that expired on October 2013. I told Slick that
               his authorization was expired. Clearly Slick was not too
               worried about getting his "medicine" since he let his
               "prescription" expire. I told the two if they turned over all
               their marijuana and smoking devices, they would be referred to
               student conduct and not criminally charged. Slick and Simpson
               agreed that was what they wanted to do. Slick grabbed a
               sandwich bag with approximately 4 grams of marijuana in it and
               a large glass bong. Simpson grabbed a sandwich bag that had one
               bud of marijuana in it and two long stemmed pipes. Slick,
               Simpson, and I walked to the dumpster where they destroyed
               their illegal items. Once the items were destroyed I explained
               the laws regarding marijuana and WSU policies. I also told the
               two about the student conduct process but both were familiar
               since they both had already been charged with MIPs earlier in
               the year. I warned the two that the next time there is a drug
               call in their room I would be applying for a warrant and
               handling it through the courts. Both stated they understood and
               I told them they were free to leave. Nothing further. I certify
