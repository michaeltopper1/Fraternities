               ____NO OTHER UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On February 14, 2014 at
               about 1034 hours Pullman Fire and WSU Police were dispatched to
               a fire alarm at Wegner Hall. I responded to the building. I was
               contacted by a male and female outside of the building. They
               said an autoclave in room 351 was opened and smoke came out. I
               made in person contact with Pullman Fire command and relayed
               the information. Pullman Fire personnel and I determined the
               incident happened in room 357. There was a white Rubbermaid
               tray laying in the garbage next to the autoclave. There was a
               black Rubbermaid tray inside the autoclave. I noticed a small
               puddle of water on the floor. The white Rubbermaid tray had a
               hole in the bottom of it. I could see white melted plastic on
               the metal autoclave rack. The black Rubbermaid tray was melted
               to the metal autoclave rack. It appears that the trays melted
               from the high heat produced by the autoclave. It is unknown if
               there was sufficient water inside the autoclave or if it
               malfunctioned. WSU Environmental Health and Safety was called
               to investigate and determine if the autoclave was still
               useable. Both trays are destroyed. Damage is estimated at
               $10.00. No further investigation. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 14th day of
               February, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               could not find that room number. The only room numbers I could
               find were 154 and 158. I walked the entire area and did not see
               anyone needing emergency assistance. I returned to the station
               and looked at the floor plan for the Dining and Housing
               Services area. I learned that room 151 is the Cashier side of
               the admin office area. I called the cashier and informed her of
               my findings and told her that room 151b is the room behind the
               cash cage and she said it did not appear there was any
               emergency and someone must have went into that office to use
               the phone. I faxed a copy of the floor plan to the cashier so

               the welfare of So Yeon Kim in Regents 388. I asked why and he
               said that all he knew was that she has not been in class the
               last couple of days and a professor of hers was worried about
               her. I tried to ask more clarifying questions but Uchida said
               he did not know and was following the direction of his boss to
               do a welfare check with the assistance of the police. I
               explained to Uchida that based on the information he was giving

               asked if I could just stand by while he did a room check, which
               I did. Uchida knocke and announced before using his master key

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 02-15-14 at approximately 0035 hours,
               I responded to Rogers Hall 2nd floor bathroom for the report of
               an unconscious male. When I arrived, hall staff advised they
               had been on rounds and found the male passed out. I observed he
               was laying on the floor in a pool of puke. He was able to talk,
               but could not sit up and was not able to fully answer
               questions. When I asked him if he knew where he was, he said
               Waller Hall. He was laying on his side and I asked him if he
               had identification with him. He said yes and told me it was in
               his pocket and I could get it. He was identified as Ronald
               McGrew by his Cougar Card. I looked around the bathroom and saw
               there was puke in all of the bathroom stalls. Medics arrived
               and evaluated McGrew. They decided he could not care for
               himself so they transported him to PRH for evaluation. While in
               the bathroom, I was unable to smell the odor of intoxicants
               over the odor of puke. Hall staff advised one of his friends
               stated he had been drinking vodka, but he denied it. I did
               observe his speech was very slurred and his actions were those
               of someone intoxicated. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 15th day of February,
               2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 02-15-14 at approximately 0245 I was
               traveling west bound on Colorado at Streit Hall. I saw a red
               Acura traveling east on Colorado St.. The vehicle had its
               headlights on high. I turned around and activated my emergency
               lights. The vehicle stopped on Colorado at Flag Lane. I
               contacted Robert L. Barron and informed him the reason for the
               stop and that the conversation was being recorded. As I was
               speaking to him I could see a bright blue indicator light in
               the dash. That light was the indication that the headlights
               were on high. I asked Barron for his drivers license, proof of
               insurance and vehicle registration. He provided all but his
               drivers license. Instead he provided a criminal citation from
               the State Of Oregon. It had all of his information on it. The
               citation was for DWL(driving while suspended). He also provided
               a debit card with his picture on it. I asked him why he didn't
               have his Oregon Drivers License on him. He stated that when he
               was arrested for DWS the Officer seized his license. I had
               WHITCOM run him through DOL. He came back suspended for un-paid
               tickets. His ADR showed the suspension for un-paid Insurance
               and Parking Tickets. I informed Barron that I was going to
               write him a citation for the suspension. I wrote the citation,
               explain it to him, parked the vehicle in the Streit Key, then
               gave him a courtesy transport to The Holiday Inn. Nothing

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 02-15-14 at 0330 hours myself and
               Corporal Daniels were dispatched to an assault that had just
               occurred in the west steps of The Northside Dining Hall. The
               R/P a Mugarura M. Musinguzi (Muggy) was waiting at the entrance
               until our arrival. When we got there I could see Muggy holding
               a papertowel to his mouth. The towel had a small amount of
               blood on it. I asked Muggy what had happen. His initial
               response was that he was jumped by 5 males. They had struck him
               with hands and feet about his head and upperbody. He was
               knocked to the ground and one of the males, later identified as
               Ryan Turman had taken $20 from his wallet. I asked him where
               the males were currently at. He said they were up in Room #305.
               While speaking to Muggy I could smell a very strong odor of
               intoxicating beverages coming from his breath. He was slurring
               his speech and his eyes were blood shot and watery. Pullman
               Fire arrived on scene. The evaluated Muggy and said there was
               no injury serious enough to require transport. Corporal Daniels
               went to the west entrance and found the scene of the fight.
               There was blood on the sidewalk and the shoe prints in the
               blood were consistant with Muggy's shoe soles. I asked Muggy to
               again tell me what had happen. He said that he was at a party
               on Greek Row with the five males. They left the party and came
               back to Northside. I asked if he was a WSU Student and he said
               "No I am just here visiting." After that time I didn't ask him
               if he was a student anywhere else. I later found out he is a
               University of Washington student. When I was speaking to Muggy
               a male I recognised from privious contacts as Zachary Brown.
               Muggy said Brown has see the altercation. I asked brown if I
               could talk to him and he said sure. I asked him to explain what
               he saw. He said that Muggy and Brown were standing on the steps
               arguing. He turned away for a second, heard something that made
               him look back at the two, he doesn't know what it was, and the
               two were hitting each other. Muggy was starting to fall twards
               the ground so He stapped in to separate the two. He said Muggy
               was bleeding and the fight had stopped so he left and went to
               the dining center. Whe he left the two were separated.I asked

               if he knew who staerted the fight and he said he didn't. I
               asked if it seemed like a mutual fight and he said it did. I
               asked Muggy if I could take some photos of he and he said I
               could. I took photos of he face and hands. He had a fat lip and
               there was blood in his mouth. I didn't notice any damage to his
               hands. I told Muggy to stay in the lobby and we would be right
               back. Daniels and I responded to #305 and contacted Ryan W.
               Turman, Devante Brown, Willie T. Beatie, and Muhammed Bah. I
               spoke to Brown while Daniels spoke to the others. Brown stated
               that he and Muggy had driven over to Pullman from Seattle
               tonight. They knew Turman and since it was a three day weekend
               they thought they would come over to Pullman and Party. The six
               males went to Greek Row and attended a few parties. Brown said
               that Muggy got really intoxicated and was trying to start
               fights. The five got tired of him so they went back to Turmans
               Northside Room. In the room Muggy remained aggressive and
               started pushing Brown. Brown was not intoxicated and didn't
               want any trouble. He tried to avoid Muggy. The five left the
               hall out the west entrance. Brown and Muggy stayed on the
               stepes while the other four went to the dining center to get
               something to eat. While on the steps Muggy tried to push Brown
               around. Brown again told him to stop, but he continued. Brown
               went to walk away and that's when Muggy spit in his face. Brown
               had enough so he struck him several times in the face. I asked
               if he struck him with a closed fist and he said he did. I asked
               if he had kicked or struck Muggy in the back/torso area and he
               said no just his face. I asked him if I could take photos of
               his hands and he said I could. I photographed both. You could
               see some abrasions on both hands. They were consistant with
               someone striking anothers face several times. I asked if Muggy
               fought back and he said he hit him several times in the face,
               but if didn't hurt. I looked at his face, but there was no
               damage at this time. I asked him about the $20 and he said the
               only thing he knew about was Muggy had sold something to a
               female resident for $20, but no one had taken any money from
               Muggy. Corporal Daniels interviewed the other males. From what
               she told me Muggy had gotten intoxicated and had been trying to
               start fights. The only two that were fightiong was Muggy and
               Brown, no one took any money from Muggy, and Muggy had been
               pushing Brown and the others around all evening. I need to re-
               interview Zchery Brown. More to follow. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               ____ day of _____________, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.
