               WSU STUDENT: ____YES ____NO OTHER UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On
               02/19/14 at approximately 1030 hours I was dispatched to SE
               Spokane St. for a fraudulent parking permit. Upon arrival I saw
               the vehicle had a wheel lock on the driver's side front tire.
               The parking services employee told me the permit was a
               photocopy. I took a picture of the permit (which was clearly a
               photocopy). The actual permit belonged to the vehicle
               (confirmed , but it was not in the vehicle. The vehicle was
               registered to Edward Kinion and parking services had a record
               of Laura Kinion using the permit. I later responded to Parking
               Services and met with Laura J. Kinion 10/14/86 in the
               conference room. I told Kinion I was recording and asked her to
               explain to me what was going on. Kinion told me that she
               returned to her car today and it had a boot on it. Kinion had
               her permit and said she was in a hurry so she taped her permit
               to her window, but didn't hang it. I explained to Kinion the
               crimes of Forgery and Making a False or Misleading Statement to
               a Police Officer. I explained to Kinion that I was at her car
               when they booted it. I told Kinion that the permit she had was
               not the one in the window. I asked Kinion to tell the truth.
               Kinion said the permit that was in the window was a photocopy.
               I explained to Kinion that parking services tends to not pursue
               criminal charges on people that pay their fines. I told Kinion
               that I can't make her pay the fines, but if she did not, then
               parking services would have me forward charges to the
               prosecutor's office. I asked Kinion if she wanted to go take
               care of her fines and she said she did. I forgot to ask Kinion
               where the photocopy was of the permit. I informed parking
               services of the resolution. I saved the photos to the case and
               saved my video to the computer. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               19th day of February, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.
