               approximately 1330 hours I responded to Northside Hall to serve
               a trespass admonition. I met with the Hall Director, Aubrie
               Piper, who escorted me to the 3rd floor. We found the subject,
               Ayana C. O'Neal 11/24/94, in a lounge. Piper and I spoke with
               O'Neal and explained the trespass admonition and she signed it.
               O'Neal was upset with the situation, but got some overnight
               items and we escorted her out. While waiting for O'Neal to
               gather her items several other people showed up. I spoke with
               the group and specifically explained that O'Neal is trespassed
               and no one has the authority to let her into Northside Hall
               except a University Official. I explained that they could be
               arrested for accessory to Trespassing if they did. I also told
               the group not to attempt to contact any other parties involved
               or the case might become criminal with harassment and
               intimidation charges. On a side note I heard a female voice in
               the room say that they were just going to say that they were
               doing shots with Chelsea. I don't know who said this, but I
               could assume that Chelsea is the other party involved in the
               situation. I don't know if the person was joking or not because
               they were quite jovial in the room. I sent a copy of the report
               and the signed order to housing and student conduct. I saved a
               scanned image of the order to the case. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               2014 at about 1336 hrs I was dispatched to a report of the odor
               of burning marijuana in Rogers Hall, located at 1355 SE Olympia
               Avenue. I contacted the complainant, Brittany A. Griffin (DOB
               07-26-1989), on the telephone. Griffin is the hall director for
               the Stephenson South residence hall. Griffin stated that on 02-
               15-2014 at about 1330 hrs she detected the odor of burning
               marijuana originating from Rogers Hall #1037. I asked Griffin
               to use a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being absolutely positive. I
               asked her how positive she was that the odor of burning
               marijuana was originating from Rogers Hall #1037. Griffin told
               me "8 to 10" on the scale. I asked Griffin how positive she was
               that the odor she detected was that of burning marijuana.
               Griffin told me "9 to 10" on the scale. Griffin stated that she
               has attended controlled burn classes conducted by the police
               department where she was exposed to the odor of burning
               marijuana. Griffin said the most recent controlled burn class
               she attended was in August 2013. Griffin said she has reported
               numerous marijuana related incidents to the police department,
               and to the best of her knowledge, marijuana has been found in
               almost all of those investigations. Griffin told me that
               according to the residence hall records, both registered
               occupants of room #1037 are under 21 years old. Based on this
               information, I applied for and was granted search warrant
               #SW021514A through Whitman County District Court. The
               telephonic warrant was granted by Judge Robinson and authorized
               the search of the residence located at Rogers Hall #1037 and
               any occupants of the room. At about 1526 hrs Corporal Kuhrt and
               I arrived at Rogers Hall #1037 and served the warrant. I
               knocked on the door, and the door was opened by an individual
               who was later identified as Leondra J. Crump-Ray (DOB 02-21-
               1995). Also inside the room was another individual who was
               later identified as Harold Price (DOB 11-12-1995). Crump-Ray
               and Price were the only occupants of the room. Crump-Ray

               resides at Rogers Hall #1037. Price is Crump-Ray's boyfriend
               and was visiting from Tacoma, Washington. I identified myself
               as a police officer and told Crump-Ray and Price that I had
               obtained a search warrant for the room. I told Crump-Ray and
               Price that they were detained and not under arrest at this
               time. They were both seated in the hallway. Crump-Ray and Price
               were 18 years old. I read the search warrant to Crump-Ray and
               Price. I advised Crump-Ray and Price of their Constitutional
               Rights, which I read from my Miranda Warnings card. Both Crump-
               Ray and Price said "yes" that they understood their rights and
               wished to waive them at this time. I explained to Crump-Ray and
               Price that I had received a report of the odor of burning
               marijuana originating from the room. I asked them if they had
               been smoking marijuana inside the room earlier today. Price
               said he had been smoking marijuana inside the room and had
               smoked a "blunt". Price said he brought the marijuana to the
               room and told me it was his responsibility. Price said Crump-
               Ray had not smoked any marijuana, and Crump-Ray confirmed that
               she did not smoke any marijuana. Price said the burnt remnants
               of the blunt were in the desk on Crump-Ray's side of the room.
               Corporal Kuhrt searched the desk and found two pieces of a
               burnt blunt. The blunt smelled like burnt marijuana. Crump-Ray
               and Price said there was no more marijuana or any other drugs
               inside the room. I continued to search the room and found two
               black backpacks on the floor in Crump-Ray's closet. Price said
               the backpacks belonged to him. I searched the backpacks and saw
               that Price had packed clothing and toiletries inside both
               backpacks. Price said he had packed the backpacks when he left
               his home to travel to Pullman. I searched an outer pocket on
               one of the backpacks and located a small plastic bag that
               contained three pink tablets. Based on my training and
               experience, the tablets appeared to be Ecstasy. Ecstasy is the
               street name for MDMA, which is a Schedule I controlled
               substance. I handed the tablets to Corporal Kuhrt and asked him
               to show them to Price, who was outside in the hallway. I heard
               Corporal Kuhrt ask Price what the tablets were, and I heard
               Price say, "Ecstasy". I completed the search of the residence
               and spoke to Price about the Ecstasy tablets. Price said the
               backpack which contained the Ecstasy tablets belonged to his
               brother. Price said he packed the backpack with clothes when he
               left his home and never checked the outer pocket. Price said he
               did not know that the Ecstasy tablets were in the backpack.
               Corporal Kuhrt asked Price for his brother's name, and Price
               said he did not want to give us that information. Price
               admitted that he brought the backpack to Crump-Ray's room and
               acknowledged that the clothing and other items inside the
               backpack belonged to him. Crump-Ray said she had no knowledge
               of the Ecstasy tablets. I photographed the backpack and small
               plastic bag that contained the Ecstasy tablets. The photographs
               were downloaded into Spillman. I seized the tablets, and they
               were later logged into evidence. I told Price that I would
               forward my case to the Whitman County Prosecuting Attorney's
               Office for review and possible criminal charges. I told Crump-
               Ray that I did not anticipate any criminal charges being
               pursued against her. Both Crump-Ray and Price were polite and

               search warrant inside the room, along with an inventory form
               listing the item that had been seized as evidence. Crump-Ray
               and Price were released. I contacted Griffin in the hallway and
               advised her of the results of the investigation. Corporal Kuhrt
               and I cleared the scene. I completed a Return of Search
               Warrant, which included a disc with the audio recording of the
               telephonic search warrant application. The audio recording was
               also saved to the digital evidence file on the computer. The
               Return of Search Warrant was placed into an envelope and
               delivered to Whitman County District Court. Investigation
               continues. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under penalty of

               told me there was an intoxicated female in the women's bathroom
               vomiting in the toilet. The women brought me to the bathroom
               where I contacted the female, later identified as Noemi Sanchez
               (6/6/95). Sanchez had her head in the toilet bowl nearly the
               whole time I spoke with her. I asked her how much she had to
               drink and she showed me the number seven on her fingers. I
               asked her several questions to determine her cognitive ability
               and she was able to answer every question. After several
               minutes of her vomiting in the bathroom, Pullman Fire responded
               and agreed that Sanchez could be taken care of by her friends.
               I contacted Hannah A. Barton, who identified herself as

               NARRATIVE: On 02/16/14 at approximately 0127 hours, I was
               driving eastbound on Campus St when I saw two male in the
               middle of street. The two males were standing in the middle of
               the intersection, Campus and B St. As I neared the two it
               looked as if they were arguing and one of the males, later
               identified as Matthew C. Mcnamara 01/04/93, was holding a
               gardening hoe. Mcnamara put his hand on the other male's
               shoulder and it appeared as a fight may start. As I was pulling
               up to the two both saw my car and walked over to the sidewalk.
               The second male, Bright Johnson 03/23/94, appeared to be
               unsteady as he walked. Johnson was stumbling side to side as he
               walked up and onto the sidewalk. Both males appeared to be
               under the age of 21 year old. I asked what was going on and
               Mcnamara stated he was walking Johnson home. Johnson started to
               walk away and I told him he needed to come back and he was not
               free to go. Johnson came back over. I asked for both of their
               ID's. Mcnamara said he did not have his and Johnson provided
               his WSU cougar card. Abou this time Cpl. Daniels arrived on
               scene. I told Mcnamara to provide his information to Intern
               Sorensen. I asked Johnson how old he was and Johnson said he
               was 19 years old. I asked Johnson what they were arguing about
               and Johnson said they were not. I asked Johnson how much he had
               to drink tonight and he said just a few. I asked how much that
               was and he said about 3 shots. I asked Johnson if I could check
               his eyes and he said I could. I told Johnson to keep his head
               still and follow my pen with his eyes only. As soon as I moved
               my pen Johnson moved his head to follow it. I had to again tell
               Johnson to keep his head still. During the test I observed,
               equal pupil size, lack of smooth pursuit, and distinct and
               sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation. As Johnson stood
               before me I could clearly smell the strong odor of intoxicants
               coming from his breath. I told Johnson that I did not think he
               was being honest about how much he had drank. Johnson said that
               he had about five shots with the last one being about 45
               minutes ago. Johnson started to explain how he could not get in
               trouble because of his prior contacts with police regarding

               drugs and alcohol. I asked for Johnson's date of birth and he
               started begging me not to do anything. I had to ask several
               times before Johnson provided his date of birth. I ran Johnson
               through dispatch and they confirmed he had prior contacts for
               alcohol and drugs. I told Johnson that he was under arrest for
               MIP Exhibiting and handcuffed (D/L) him. I advised Johnson of
               his right to counsel. I told Johnson that we were going down to
               PPD where he would be fingerprinted and photographed. Johnson
               said he did not know what he did wrong. I explained the
               elements of the crime to Johnson. Johnson was searched incident
               to arrest and no weapons or illegal items were found. I
               recontacted Mcnamara who said they had not been arguing.
               Mcnamara stated he was walking Johnson home and Mcnamara turned
               around to has Johnson a question while they were in the middle
               of the road. Mcnamara said he and Johnson were not arguing and
               nothing was wrong. I asked what the hoe was for. Mcnamara said
               he grabbed that for Johnson to use when walking like a cane.
               Johnson was 21 years old and told he was free to go. I
               transported Johnson to Pullman Holding Facility. While en route
               Johnson kept saying over and over, "you killed my dream."
               Johnson was latched onto the idea that he would be kicked out
               of school and was very emotional about it. While pulling up to
               the Holding Facility Johnson said, "I'm going to kill myself."
               I asked Johnson what he said and Johnson said, "I did not say
               anything." I told Johnson I heard what he said and asked him if
               he was going to hurt himself. Johnson said he did not say that.
               I asked Johnson if he wanted to hurt himself and again Johnson
               said, "I did not say that." I walked Johnson into the Holding
               Facility and began his paperwork. Johnson was still emotional
               and said he was a bad person. I told Johnson that I did not
               think he was a bad person just that he had made a poor decision
               tonight. Johnson then said, "you will never see me again." I
               interpreted this as meaning that Johnson was not going to be in
               trouble again. Johnson repeated "you will never see me again"
               several more times. Johnson also said, "I hate my life" and "my
               life has no meaning." I placed Johnson in a holding cell as the
               records person entered Johnson's information into the computer.
               Johnson began to bang on the cell door. I told Johnson that he
               was going to be released in just a few minutes if he could calm
               down. Johnson stopped banging on the door and I walked away.
               About a minute later Johnson started banging on the door even
               harder. I walked over to the cell and saw Johnson laying on his
               back kicking the door with his feet. I told Johnson to stop and
               he did eventually. When trying to fingerprint Johnson said,
               "you will never see me again." I asked Johnson why and he said,
               "nope it doesn't matter." I asked Johnson if he was going to
               hurt himself and Johnson said no. I asked Johnson why he was
               making comments like he wanted to hurt himself. Johnson said he
               wasn't going to hurt himself he was just drunk. As Intern
               Sorensen was fingerprinting Johnson, he said, "is he going to
               shoot me, because I'm black?" I told Johnson that his comments
               were offensive and rude. Johnson was still making comments like
               you wont see me again. Johnson was not working with Intern
               Sorensen to get his fingerprints done. I took over the
               fingerprinting. When trying to do the fingerprints Johnson was

               purposefully taking his fingers off the machine to mess with
               it. It was clear that Johnson was not going to cooperate so I
               led Johnson by the arm and put him back in the cell. I issued
               Johnson Sector citation 4Z0255358 for RCW 66.44.270.2B MIP
               Exhibiting and explained it to him. I told Johnson that he was
               now in protective custody for his statements about hurting
               himself. Johnson made it clear that he did not want to go to
               the hospital however he did not resist. Once at the hospital
               Johnson was turned over to the medical staff. I filled out the
               protective custody paperwork and had the doctor sign it. I
               turned Johnson over to the custody of the hospital and cleared.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 16th day of February, 2014, in

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On February 16, 2014 at about 0659 hours
               I responded to Campus Commons North A107 to back up Pullman
               Police Officer Gordon per his request. We attempted to contact
               the residents at A107 as they may have been involved in the
               collision. As we were knocking on the door I saw an Asian male
               get out of a vehicle. He had blood on his hands and face. He
               was carrying keys and handful of papers. I was nearest and
               approached him. The male was later identified as Adrian W. Wong
               (03/08/92). Wong told us that he was the driver in the car
               accident. He was asked if he needed an ambulance. Wong said he
               didn't. It was obvious that he had sustained injuries as he was
               bloody. We requested Pullman Fire respond to evaluate him. I
               could smell the odor of alcohol coming from his breath as he
               talked to us. Wong was shivering as we were outside on the
               sidewalk near his apartment. The weather conditions on this
               date at 0653 hours as reported by the National Weather Service
               Pullman Moscow Regional Airport reporting stations was:
               TEMPERATURE: 35 Degrees Fahrenheit WINDS: 17 MPH SW WIND CHILL:
               25 Degrees Fahrenheit Wong invited us into his apartment. We
               all went inside where he sat down and put a blanket around
               himself to warm up. Officer Gordon spoke with Wong about the
               collision. He admitted to consuming alcohol prior to driving
               and not after the accident. He also admitted to traveling at 45
               mph on a 25 mph city street. He said there was a passenger in
               the back seat of his car. The passenger was now at a Grove
               Apartment. Wong gave consent for officers to search his
               vehicle. Wong provided a voluntary breath sample into my Alco
               Sensor FST #049030. The breath sample provided by Wong was a
               .183. Pullman Fire personnel soon arrived and evaluated Wong.
               Wong complained about some light bleeding on his forehead and
               glass in his eyes and hands. Pullman Fire transported Wong to
               Pullman Regional Hospital. I followed the ambulance to the
               hospital and stood by until I was relieved by PPD Sgt. Sorem.
               Wong was not in custody when in the ambulance or during my time
               at the hospital. I downloaded video taken from my Vivue camera.
               I provided Pullman Police with a copy of the video. No further
               investigation. Assistance provided. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
