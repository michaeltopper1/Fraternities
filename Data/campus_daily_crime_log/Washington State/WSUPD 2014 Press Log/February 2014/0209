               08-12-1953) were involved in a non-injury vehicle collision.

               Insurance DAMAGE: no damage DAMAGE VALUE: n/a WITNESS(ES): n/a
               NARRATIVE: On 02-09-2014 at about 1254 hrs I was dispatched to
               a non-injury vehicle collision on Wilson Road near the
               intersection of Stadium Way. Officer Jones and I arrived on
               scene and contacted the following individuals: Carolina Garces
               Zapico (DOB 11-23-1991) and Steven E. Syms (DOB 08-12-1953).
               Zapico was the driver of a silver, 2010 Mazda CX-7 (WA Lic.
               AAE0184). Syms was the driver of a red, 1998 Jeep Wrangler (WA
               Lic. 12601E). Syms is an employee of Washington State
               University and was working at the time of the collision. Syms
               was driving his work vehicle, which was equipped with a snow
               plow blade. There were no other passengers or witnesses. After
               speaking with Zapico and Syms, I determined the following:
               Zapico was stopped alongside the curb of the westbound lane of
               Wilson Road. Syms was traveling westbound on Wilson Road.
               Zapico did not see Syms traveling past her position, and she
               moved her vehicle away from the curb and into the lane of
               travel occupied by Syms. Zapico moved her vehicle directly into
               the path of Syms, and he could not avoid the collision. The
               front snow plow blade of Syms' vehicle struck the driver side
               of Zapico's vehicle. Zapico and Syms did not complain of any
               injuries. The damage to Zapico's vehicle was consistent with
               the information provided by the drivers. The vehicles had not
               been moved prior to my arrival. Officer Jones photographed the
               vehicles, and the photographs were downloaded into Spillman. I
               gave Zapico a verbal warning for unsafe starting of a parked
               vehicle and failing to yield to Syms. I completed a Sector
               PTCR. No further action at this time. Olmstead/339 I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.

               09-2014 at about 1443 hrs I was dispatched to report of
               harassment in Community-Duncan Dunn Hall, located at 720 NE B
               Street. I arrived on scene and contacted the complainant,
               Alexis M. Jones (DOB 10-04-1994), in the 1st floor study
               lounge. Jones resides at Community-Duncan Dunn Hall #154.
               Jones' roommate was later identified as Presli M. Atwood (DOB
               10-03-1994). Jones told me the following: Jones has been
               experiencing some health problems and was treated at the WSU
               Health and Wellness Clinic. Jones was prescribed an anti-viral
               medication from the doctor. Coincidentally, this medication is
               also commonly used to treat genital herpes. Atwood saw the
               medication in their residence hall room and has been telling
               all their mutual friends that Jones has herpes. Jones is upset
               because now everyone thinks that she has herpes when she really
               does not. Jones estimated that the harassment from Atwood began
               at about 1800 hrs on 02-07-2014 and has continued to 1400 hrs
               on 02-09-2014. Jones told me that she has a small white board
               inside her residence hall room. On 02-09-2014 at about 1200 hrs
               Jones said she noticed that someone had written, "she got the
               herp" on her white board. Jones explained that she believes
               Atwood started spreading the herpes rumor because Atwood
               believed Jones was going to have sex with Atwood's ex-boyfriend
               and was jealous. Jones said that Atwood will be moving out to
               another residence hall room on 02-11-2014. Jones was concerned
               that Atwood might steal or damage some of her property when she
               moves out. Jones requested that I contact Atwood and warn her
               about her behavior. At about 1545 hrs I contacted Atwood in her
               residence hall room. I warned Atwood about her behavior and
               explained to her how rumors and gossip can hurt people's
               feelings. Atwood said that she is not the only person who
               believes Jones has herpes and is not the only person spreading
               the rumors. Atwood said Jones told her that she really does
               have herpes and was planning on purposefully having sex with
               Atwood's ex-boyfriend in order to give him the disease. Atwood
               said she warned her ex-boyfriend about Jones. I questioned
               Atwood about the herpes statement which was written on Jones'
               white board. Atwood told me she had nothing to do with that and

               said another friend wrote the statement. Atwood said on 02-11-
               2014 she will be moving to another room on the third floor of
               the residence hall. Atwood said she didn't want to be around
               Jones, so she would stay with friends until she moves out. I
               told Atwood not to damage or take any of Jones' property when
               she moves out. I cleared the scene. After reviewing the facts
               in this investigation, I determined that no criminal offense

               NARRATIVE: On 02-09-14 at about 1539 hours Officer Jones was
               dispatched to this welfare check. I told him I could take care
               of it. Whitcom told me that a mother had called requesting a
               welfare check on her son that lives in Northside Residence room
               564. She stated that he lost his job sometime in the last two
               weeks and that she has not talked to him in two weeks. She also
               stated that he is depressed. The RP identified her son as Marco
               Martija-Harris. I recalled conducting a welfare check on Marco
               within the last two weeks. Whitcom confirmed that it was on
               Jan. 30th. In that case Marco was contacted and was in good
               spirits. I went to Northside Residence and knocked on the door
               to room 564. I recognized the male that answered the door as
               Marco. I told him that his mom was trying to get in touch with
               him. He appeared fine and spoke with me. I asked why his mom
               would be so concerned about him. He said he was not sure but
               thinks that she believes he is upset over losing his job. He
               said that he does not care and has been looking for other work.
               Marco seemed embarrassed that his mom called the police again
               looking for him. He called her while I stood there. I listened
               as Marco told his mother that he has been going to classes, has
               A's and B's, and is looking for work. He tried to re-assure her
               that he is fine. There was no indication to me that Marco is
               depressed or sad over losing his job, he just seemed
               embarrassed and told his mom to stop calling the police to come
               looking for him. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 9th day of
               February, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               tooth. Upon arrival I found, Kristin Adeline Berry 09/02/94,
               sitting in a chair holding a paper towel to her cut lip. Berry
               said she had woken up with stomach pains and walked to her
               bathroom. Berry said she must have passed out because when she
               woke up she was on the floor and her lip was bleeding. Berry
               had chipped one of her front upper teeth on the floor which in
               turn cut her bottom lip. Berry said she had been sick all week
               with a cold. Berry said her head did not hurt and she did not
               think she hit it on anything. Once medics arrived they
               evaluated Berry and told her she did not have to go to the

               go to the hospital and I cleared. Nothing further. I certify

               02/10/14 at approximately 0154 hours, I responded to Gannon
               Hall room 106 where dispatch was reporting a male, Micah
               Alexander Pittsley 04/20/95, who had passed out several times.
               Upon arrival I was greeted by Pittsley's roommate who said
               Pittsley was in the bathroom. I opened to door slightly to the
               bathroom and asked Pittsley if he was ok. Pittsley said he was
               right now but earlier he had woken up with a bag stomach ache.
               Pittsley went to the bathroom and had very bad gas. Pittsley
               said he went to stand up and must have passed out because he
               woke up on the bathroom floor. Pittsley tried to stand up again
               but again passed out and fell down. Pittsley said he thinks he
               may have hit his head a few times. Pittsley stated he was
               finally able to walk back to his room and tell his roommate to
               call 911. While Pittsley's roommate was calling 911, Pittsley
               had the urge to go to the bathroom again and walked there. Once
               medics arrived they evaluated Pittsley and advised that he
               needed to be checked out at the hospital because of his
               irregular heartbeat. Pittsley was transported to PRH via
               ambulance and I cleared. Nothing further. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
