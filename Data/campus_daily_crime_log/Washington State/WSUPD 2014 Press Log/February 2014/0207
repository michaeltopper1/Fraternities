               02/07/14 at approximately 0900 hours I was dispatched to a hit
               and run collision that happened a week prior. I called the
               reporting party, Timothy E. Hillestad (WSU Housing
               Maintenance). Hillestad said he had parked his work vehicle in
               the parking lot of Kamiak Apts .at the A building on 01/30/14
               between 1400-1500 hours. Hillestad said when he returned he
               noticed the rear bumper on the driver's side was hanging down
               from the vehicle. Hillestad said he noticed a crack on the
               bumper and blue paint transfer. Hillestad said the paint
               transfer looked like letters from a license plate. Hillestad
               said he later noticed a blue vehicle in the same parking area
               with damage to the license plate area. Hillestad measured the
               damage on his car and the damage on the other vehicle and it
               matched up. I responded to housing and dining services and
               photographed the damage to the state vehicle (WA17271E). I
               noticed the damage that was described and I measured the height
               of the damage to be between 16 and 19 inches from the ground.
               Hillestad told me he had contacted Risk Management about the
               collision already. I asked Hillestad if he completed a
               collision report form and he said he had not. I responded to
               Kamiak Apts at the A building and found the other vehicle (WA
               AMH8342). I found white paint transfer to the left of the rear
               license plate. I also noticed the letters of the license plate
               had white paint transfer on it. The license plate was also
               dented at the letters. I photographed the damage and measured
               the damage to be between 16 and 19 inches. While I was looking
               at the car a male subject, later identified by WADL as Natalio
               Soto Rivera 07/09/89, approached me and said it was his car and
               asked if he could help me. I explained that it appeared his
               vehicle was involved in a collision in the parking lot. Soto
               said the vehicle is rarely driven and asked when it happened. I
               told Soto it happened last week and the vehicle was parked in
               the maintenance vehicle spot. Soto said he was not driving the
               vehicle and his wife did not tell him of being in a collision.
               I asked Soto where his wife was and he said he dropped her off
               at class (in their other vehicle). I asked Soto for his wife's
               information and he provided me with Jahaira A. Soto 06/06/93. I
               asked Soto to have his wife contact me when she is out of

               class. I had Hillestad respond with the vehicle, which he did.
               I showed Soto the damage and he agreed it matched up and could
               see the letter transfer from his license plate to the other
               vehicle. I asked Soto for his insurance information and he said
               the vehicle is not insured, but provided me with the insurance
               from his other car (Geico 4293-57-53-22). I provided Soto with
               my business card and case number and told him to contact Risk
               Management about the collision. I saved the photos to the case.
               At 1340 hours I spoke with Jahaira on the phone. Jahaira said
               she did not remember hitting any vehicles. I told Jahaira it
               occurred on 01/30/14 between 1400-1500 hours. Jahaira said she
               is in class from 0900-1600 hours on Thursdays and would have
               been on Campus. I asked Jahaira if Natalio would have been
               driving the car and she said that she is the only one who
               drives the car. I asked Jahaira if she would have driven the
               car the day before or after and she said she could have, but
               gets dropped off by her husband and picked up. I told Jahaira
               that her insurance company and the university would be in touch
               and decide how to resolve the issue. I sent an email to Risk
               Management advising them of my findings. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 7th day of February, 2014, in Pullman,

               the case. I spoke with Grimm at approximately 1430 hours. I
               explained to him that the permit in his window was fraudulent
               and that parking services had wheel locked his car. Grimm said
               he borrowed the permit from a friend. I told Grimm to talk with
               parking services to take care of his fines and he said he
               would. I called Ortlieb and advised him of my conversation with
               Grimm. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 7th day of February,

               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W0508 SYNOPSIS: Bryla Jones came
               to the WSU Police Department to report that her ex-boyfriend
               was cyber stalking her. Over the past month and a half, she has
               received numerous amounts of text messages, emails, and
               Facebook messages from him. At this time, she didn't want him
               arrested, but she wanted me to contact Carl R. Tiburcio and
               tell him to stop contacting her. NAME/DOB: Carl R. Tiburcio

               020714 at approximately 1202 hours, I contacted Bryla Jones in
               the front office of the WSU Police Department. Jones was with
               Tamara Jell (ATVP) who wanted to talk to me about a potential
               stalking/harassment situation that Jones was involved in. I
               invited them into the WSU Police Department and Jones told me
               the following. She began dating Carl R. Tiburcio approximately
               a year and a half ago. Approximately a month and a half ago,
               she broke up with Tiburcio and ever since, he has been sending
               her emails, texts, and Facebook messages. Jones told Tiburcio
               numerous times to stop messaging her and he continues to. He
               sent numerous hateful emails using profanity towards her. The
               final email he sent her was on 020614 at approximately 0120
               hours. This email said, "Call me right now. If your fuck buddy
               speaks to me again, I die or he dies. And I am so tired of this
               life." I placed the emails in the case file. I asked Jones what
               she would like. I explained that he could be arrested for cyber
               stalking (DV) amongst other potential crimes. Jones told me she
               wants him to stop messaging her and attempting to talk to her,
               but that she didn't want him arrested at this point. I advised
               her to go to the Whitman County Courthouse and apply for a anti
               harassment order. I also told her that if he continues the
               behavior to report it as soon as it happens. I contacted
               Tiburcio and told him to stop contacting Jones. I told him that
               he could be arrested for Cyberstalking and that Jones didn't
               want him arrested at this point. I asked Tiburcio if we could
               come to an agreement that he would not contact Jones any more.
               He assurred me he wouldn't. I contacted Jones and recommended
               that she get a protection order from Tiburcio, but that I spoke
               with him and he agreed not to make any contact with her in the
               future. Jones thanked me and told me she would continue with
               the protection order. I will contact Jones on 021114 regarding
               the status of the protection order. Case pending follow up. I

               02/07/14 at approximately 1215 hours I saw a vehicle that
               appeared to have been involved in a collision on NE Stadium Way
               at the entrance to the CUE parking garage. I contacted the
               driver, Stephen R. McGahan 02/17/67, and asked if he was
               injured and he said no. McGahan told me he had already
               exchanged information with the other driver, who was now gone.
               I took a picture of the damage to McGahan's car, which
               consisted of extensive front end damage on the passenger side.
               I provided McGahan with my business card and case number and
               told him if he needs any further assistance to contact me. I
               saved the photos to the case. At 1400 hours the other involved
               driver, Lukas T. Kawalilak 09/03/88, contacted me. Kawalilak
               said he was traveling south on SE Stadium Way and stopped for a
               pedestrian at the crosswalk at the entrance of CUE parking
               garage. Kawalilak said he was struck from behind by MaGahan.
               Kawalilak confirmed they exchanged information and said he had
               minor damage consisting of scratches to the rear driver's side
               of his vehicle. I provided Kawalilak with the case number.
               Since the driver's fulfilled their obligation for exchanging
               information I did not further investigate the collision.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 7th day of February, 2014, in

               at about 1309 hours I was dispatched to a two (2) vehicle non
               injury collision. I was initially dispatched to the parking lot
               behind Animal Lab Sciences on Wilson Rd. This was the incorrect
               location. After calling the reporting party I learned they were
               in the parking lot behind McCoy Hall off of Stadium Way. I
               responded to that location where I contacted the parties.
               Pappas and Padrta told me they were traveling southbound on
               Stadium Way near the Smith Center. Their vehicle was in the
               left lane nearest the center median. Pappas said she stopped
               for a pedestrian crossing the street. They both said the
               vehicle in the right southbound lane stopped as well. Their
               vehicle was struck from behind by Burns. Burns told me that she
               was traveling southbound on Stadium Way near the Smith Center.
               She said she did not see the vehicle in front of her stopped
               for a pedestrian and struck the vehicle. Burns also told me she
               does not have insurance for her vehicle. I photographed both
               vehicles. The weather at the time of the collision according to
               the National Weather Service Pullman Moscow Regional Airport
               reporting station was 12 degrees Fahrenheit with clear skies.
               The roadway was covered with snow and ice. I exchanged
               information between the parties. I issued Burns Sector
               Infraction #4Z0254085 for violation of RCW 46.30.020 -
               Operating Motor Vehicle without Insurance. A Sector PTCR was

               PPD being dispatched to the report of a theft that had occurred
               at WalMart. Whitcom advised that the suspects in that case had

               About a minute later I observed a blue Chrysler Sebring with
               idaho plates pass by, headed eastbound. PPD requested that I
               initiate a ttraffic stop, which I did. The vehicle was stopped

               02/07/14 at 2343 hrs I was at the WSU police station when I
               heard Officer Westerman dispatched to a report of an
               intoxicated person who was currently walking up Wilson Rd. from
               Stadium Way. I walked outside and could see the male, later
               identified as John J. Adams 9091594), walking up Wilson Rd.
               Adams appeared to be under the age of 21 and was having
               difficulty walking, stumbling from one side of the sidewalk to
               the other. The stumbling was not from the snow as the sidewalk
               was fairly clear and his stumbling was back and forth multiple
               times. I contacted Adams in front of the Fine Arts building. I
               asked where he was going and he said his dorm, Stimson Hall. As
               I spoke to Adams I could smell a strong odor of intoxicants on
               his breath. I asked how much he had to drink and he said 2
               beers. I asked if I could check his eyes and he agreed. I
               administered a horizontal gaze nystagmus test on him and
               observed he had bloodshot and watery eyes, a lack of smooth
               pursuit, and a distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum
               deviation in both eyes. I asked Adams if he had ever been
               arrested before and he admitted he was arrested for DUI in
               October. I told him he was under arrest for MIP Exhibiting and
               placed him in handcuffs (double locked). I advised him of his
               right to remain silent and his right to an attorney. I walked
               Adams to the WSU Police Station where I issued him criminal
               citation #4Z0255491 for MIP Exhibiting. I explained the
               citation to him. Officer Westerman provided Adams with a
               courtesy transport to his dorm where he received his copy of
               the citation and was released. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of

               at about 0006 hrs I was driving northbound on Thatuna Rd.
               approaching a stop sign at Colorado St. when I noticed two
               males standing near the garbage can on the corner of Colorado
               St. and Thatuna Rd. They caught my attention because one of the
               males, later identified as Todd E.S. Lehman(022395), appeared
               to be under the age of 21 and was bent over as if he were
               vomiting. Lehman stood up and wiped his mouth, also indicating
               he had been vomiting. I got out of my patrol car and contacted
               them as they were still standing on the corner. I asked Lehman
               if he was ok and he said yes, that he ate some bad tacos
               earlier in the evening. As Lehman spoke I could smell the odor
               of intoxicants on his breath. I asked how much he had to drink
               and he said 1 beer earlier in the night. I asked if I could
               check his eyes and he said I could. I administered a horizontal
               gaze nystagmus test on him and observed he had bloodshot and
               watery eyes, a lack of smooth pursuit, and a distinct and
               sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes. I asked
               Lehman how much he really had to drink and he insisted it was
               only one beer and he had been vomiting because of bad foot. I
               asked Lehman for his ID and he provided me with his WA driver's
               license, which confirmed he was under 21. I ran Lehman through
               Dispatch, who advised he was warned for marijuana possession in
               January. I told Lehman he was under arrest for MIP Exhibiting
               and placed him in handcuffs (double locked). I advised him of
               his right to remain silent and his right to an attorney. I
               issued Lehman criminal citation #4Z0166637 for MIP Exhibiting.

               be under the age of 21. I drove past the three and turned
               around. I came back down Colorado and this time the three were
               no longer linked arms. Now that Smith was not being assisted in
               her walking I observed her stumbling side to side and at one
               point bumped into one of her friends. I pulled into the Scott
               Coman parking lot and contacted the three as they reached the
               parking lot. I asked the group if they had a second to talk and
               all three stopped. I told Smith I had stopped to talk to her in
               particular and explained what I observed. Smith said she was
               upset about a family matter. Smith had tears and mascara
               smeared on her cheeks. I asked Smith for her ID and she
               provided her WSU cougar card. I asked Smith how old she was and
               Smith said she was 18 years old. Smith provided date of birth
               verbally. I asked Smith how much she had to drink tonight and
               she said, "I haven't had hardly anything, just like one beer."
               I asked Smith if I could check her eyes and she said I could. I
               performed an HGN test of Smith and observed, equal pupil size,
               lack of smooth pursuit, and distinct and sustained nystagmus at
               maximum deviation. As soon as I moved my pen, Smith moved her
               head to follow the pen even though I had instructed her to keep
               her head still and only follow the pen with her eyes only.
               Smith was also guessing where I was going to move the pen
               instead of following it. While standing in front of Smith I
               could smell the odor of intoxicants coming from her breath. I
               told Smith she was under arrest for MIP Exhibiting and
               handcuffed (D/L) her. Smith was searched incident to arrest and
               no weapons or evidence were found. I placed Smith in the
               backseat of my patrol car while I searched Smith's name. Smith
               had no prior contacts for alcohol or drugs. I told Smith that I

               would be forwarding charges of MIP Exhibiting to the
               prosecutor. I also told Smith that this would be referred to
               student conduct. I asked Smith's friends if one of them would
               be willing to watch over Smith for the night. One of her
               friend, Aspen Paige Robel 11/18/94, said she would. Robel
               appeared to be sober. I released Smith into Robel's care and
               cleared. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 8th day of February,
               2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               02/08/14 at about 0050 hrs Dispatch advised of a subject who
               was found passed out in the hallway of Sloan Hall. Officer
               Westerman and I responded. Upon my arrival I found a subject,
               later identified as Connor M. Otos (041594), who was sitting in
               the hallway on the ground floor, outside room 24. Otos appeared
               to be passed out and smelled strongly of intoxicants. The
               complainant, Brian L. Kriebel, said he had been locking up the
               building and found Otos passed out where he was upon my
               arrival. I noticed Otos appeared to be under the age of 21. I
               administered a sternum rub on Otos to try and wake him to
               determine his level of intoxication. Otos pulled away and woke
               slightly. I asked him what his name was and he did not respond.
               I removed Otos' wallet from his pocket and retrieved his ID
               from it. I began asking him questions and he would answer one
               or two before becoming unconscious again. Each time he would
               stop responding I would administer a sternum rub to try and
               keep Otos awake because he appeared to be highly intoxicated. I
               could smell the odor of intoxicants on his breath as I spoke
               with him. After one of the sternum rubs Otos said that hurt and
               said, "I'll beat your ass". I had already identified myself as
               a police officer but made clear to Otos again that I was a
               police officer and he should not try to assault me. I told him
               if he would stay awake and talk to me I would not have to try
               and keep him awake. I told him if he refused to stay awake I
               would have to continue annoying him to keep him awake. He
               became unresponsive again so I leaned in and put my right hand
               to his chest to do another sternum rub. Otos opened his eyes,
               made a fist with his right hand and pulled his arm back. It was
               clear Otos was loading up to throw a punch. Otos swung at me
               but missed. I grabbed Otos' right arm and put it behind his
               back. He initially refused to bring his left arm behind his
               back and was holding on to his right shoulder with his left arm
               to resist. Officer Westerman was able to pull Otos' arm around
               and I placed him in handcuffs (double locked). I advised him he
               was under arrest for attempted assault 3rd degree. I told him
               of his right to remain silent and his right to an attorney.

               Pullman Ambulance Personnel arrived on scene and spoke with
               Otos. The decided he did not need to go to the hospital. From
               the time I advised Otos of his right to remain silent and his
               right to an attorney he would repeat that he was, "calling an
               attorney". I assumed he meant he wanted to call an attorney. I
               explained to Otos I had no guilt seeking questions for him and
               thus was not going to be calling and waking up an attorney for
               him to speak to. I transported Otos to the Pullman PD holding
               facility and placed him in a cell. Otos was later transported
               to the Whitman County Jail for booking. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 08 day of February, 2014, in Pullman,

               NARRATIVE: On 02/08/14 at approximately 0152 hours, I was
               driving eastbound on Colorado Street near WSU parking services
               when I noticed a female trying to walk eastbound on Colorado.
               The female appeared to be having a lot of difficulty while
               walking. There is a railing that separates the roadway and side
               walk of Colorado Street. When the female, later identified as
               Renata Susana Oconnell 06/15/95, reached the railing she
               grabbed on and used it for every step to balance herself. As I
               paralleled Oconnell, I was able to see her face and noticed she
               appeared to be under the age of 21. Oconnell had a blank look
               of her face as if she did not know what was going on. I passed
               Oconnell and when I was turning around to contact her, I saw
               Oconnell fall down when crossing the intersection of Colorado
               and D St. Two unidentified females came to Oconnell's aid and
               helped her up. At the time there was about a half of inch of
               snow on the ground. I stopped just prior to Oconnell and asked
               if she had a second to talk. Oconnell stopped and I asked her
               where she was walking to. Oconnell said Regents Hall. I told
               Oconnell what I had observed. I asked Oconnell if she had her
               ID with her and she said no. I wrote down Oconnell's
               information that she provided verbally. Oconnell identified
               herself as 18 yeas old. While doing this I could smell the odor
               of intoxicants coming from her breath even though I was
               standing about 5 feet away from her. I asked Oconnell if I
               could check her eyes and she said I could. I performed an HGN
               test on Oconnell and observed, equal pupil size, lack of smooth
               pursuit, and distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum
               deviation. Again I could clearly smell the overpowering odor of
               intoxicants coming from Oconnell's breath. I ran Oconnell
               through dispatch and they stated that Oconnell did not have any
               prior contacts for alcohol or drugs. I told Oconnell that I
               would be forwarding charges of MIP Exhibiting to the prosecutor
               as well as referring this case to student conduct. Oconnell
               said she understood. I offered Oconnell a ride to her dorm
               because I was worried that she would not make it safely.
               Oconnell refused my offer several times and said the two
               females who helped her up would walk her home. I told Oconnell
