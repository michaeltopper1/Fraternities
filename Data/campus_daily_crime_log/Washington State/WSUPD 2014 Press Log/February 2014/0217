               handle of the telephone, located near the bus stop on Colorado

               ____NO OTHER UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 02-17-14, at
               approximately 1603 hours, Michael E. Sabo (02-27-76), called
               Whitcom stating the phone handle portion of the telephone,
               located near the bus stop on Colorado Street at Bohler
               Gymnasium, was missing. I responded to the area and it looks
               like someone pulled the telephone handle off of its wire and
               took it. I took photos of the damage and called WSU Information
               Technology so they could create a work order to have the
               telephone fixed. Once back at the WSU Police Department I
               downloaded the photos onto the WSU Police computer system.
               There are no suspects or leads. I have no idea when the damage
               to the telephone occurred. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               building and was told a female named Cristina had accidentally
               set off the alarm. We contacted her and she stated it was her
               first morning opening and her code for the alarm was not
               working. Whitcom attempted to verify her status with a
               responsible, but was unable to reach any. She was in uniform
               and appeared to be an employee. I verified her information with
               her Cougar Card and turned off the alarm. I asked her to have
               her supervisor update the responsible list with Whitcom and she
               stated she would. We cleared. I certify and declare under
