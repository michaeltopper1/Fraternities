               Anne was concerned for the health of the man, due to the cold

               described the man as a mid twenties white male with dirty light
               brown hair wearing a two tone blue coat and blue jeans. She
               said he appears as if he has not bathed in a long time and
               smells like a heavy smoker. Anne believes he is hanging around
               McAllister since she has scene him there a couple times this
               week as well as last week. Anne said she saw him today right
               inside the McAllister entrance, but when he saw her he turned
               around and walked out. He then headed south down Stadium Way.

               around 1848 hrs, while clearing another call I was contacted
               regarding a I-pad mini which had been stolen from the
               conference room located in Goldsworthy Hall sometime between
               1630 hrs and 1715 hrs on 020414. I was not able to speak with
               the complainant, but the information had been given to hall
               staff which they later gave to me. When asked where the I-pad
               had been when it had been taken I was told it had been sitting
               out in the conference room during an event held in the hall. I
               asked about the specifics about the I-pad and was told it was
               an Apple I-pad mini with a red cover. The serial number for the
               I-pad was given as F4MJXTU2F193, and I also asked if the
               security measures, specifically locking down the device and
               trying to track it had been used. I was told the security
               measures had been activated and the the device had been turned
               off by whoever had it. I thanked them for the information and
               cleared. Upon my return to the WSU Police Department I emailed
               WSU Information Technologies regarding trying to track the
               stolen laptop in addition to filling out the necessary
               paperwork to sign the laptop as stolen. As of 0009 hrs on
               020514 I have not been able to speak with the victim in this
               case, Alisha N Brown, and will attempt to have dayshift attempt
               to contact her to confirm the information I was given before
