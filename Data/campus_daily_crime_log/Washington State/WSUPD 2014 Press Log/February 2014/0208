               I was dispatched to a drugs call at Rogers Hall room 539. Upon
               arrival the RED told me that the room smelled of marijuana but

               up to room 539 I could smell the overpowering odor of marijuana
               coming from the room. It was obvious that the odor was coming
               from 539 and not the surrounding rooms. I knocked on the door
               for several minutes without any answer. With the help of the
               RED I was able to figure out the names of Adam Edward Jackson
               08/15/95 and Andrese Louis Collins 07/20/95 as being assigned
               to the room. Theses names also matched door decorations on the

               her roommate did smoke marijuana. I asked if she could call her
               roommate and see if she could come to speak with me. Her
               roommate, Carolina M. Ramirez (022495), did not answer the
               phone. I provided my business card and case number to Flores. I
               asked her to give it to her roommate and ask Ramirez to call
               me. I informed Flores of the laws concerning constructive
               possession and the common areas of their room. I have yet to
               receive a call from Ramirez. More to follow. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               about 0026 hrs I was driving westbound on Ellis Way when I
               noticed two vehicles driving eastbound on Ferdinands Ln. The
               vehicles caught my attention because there was a fair amount of
               new snow and the orange parking lot they were driving toward is
               commonly used by people for spinning "cookies" in their cars
               after new snow. I watched as the vehicles turned into the
               parking lot and drove around the perimiter before stopping with
               their driver's windows together. I turned into the parking lot
               and contacted the drivers, Timothy C. White (081593) and Acob
               E. Geomar (123093). I told them what I suspected they were
               about to do and they acknowledged I was right. I told them that
               it was considered negligent driving and they could get a ticket
               for it. They decided to go home. Nothing further. NAME/DOB:

               02/09/14 at about 0105 hrs I was driving southbound on Stadium
               Way approaching Nevada St. when I noticed a vehicle, WA
               AFE7178, which was sideways on the south east corner of the
               intersection. The vehicle was on the sidewalk and the driver
               apparently lost control in the snow, ending up on the sidewalk.
               I stopped and contacted the driver, Saul I. Rios-Vandurin
               (112993), who told me he was driving south on Stadium Way and
               tried to turn eastbound on to Nevada St. when he lost control,
               sliding sideways onto the sidewalk. I looked at Rios-Vandurin's
               vehicle and saw there was no damage. He had chains on the front
               tires which were not properly installed. They were far too
               loose and actually slid off the tread of the tires, down along
               the side of the wheel. All four of Rios-Vandurin's tires were
               nearly bald with no tread left on them. I tried to remove the
               chains for Rios-Vandurin but they were damaged from improper
               installation the first time. I told Rios-Vandurin he was not
               going to be able to drive his car on the road with bald tires.
               I asked Dispatch to send the next available tow. I told Rios-
               Vandurin I could cut the chains off his car for him, which was
               going to be the only way to get them off anyway. He said that
               was fine. I cut the chains off and watied for the tow to
               arrive. The tow arrived and towed the vehicle to the Grey lot
               near Stephenson at Rios-Vandurin's request. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 02/09/14 at approximately 0113 hours,
               I was driving westbound on Colorado Street near the Soccer
               Field when I noticed three males walking eastbound on Colorado.
               One male, later identified as Abdou Kadri Jabbi 11/16/94, in
               particular grabbed my attention. Jabbi was stumbling forward
               and backwards and he tried to walk with his friends. Jabbi
               looked as if he was going to fall over but did not when I was
               driving past him. All three males appeared to be under the age
               of 21. I turned around and saw the three walk into the Scott
               Coman parking lot. I pulled into the lot and parked. I walked
               up to the group as they had stopped walking. I introduced
               myself and told the group why I was contacting them. While
               explained what I observed, Jabbi was swaying back and forth as
               tied to stand still. Jabbi said he was walking to Streit Hall.
               I asked Jabbi if he had his ID with him and he said no. I asked
               Jabbi how old he was and Jabbi said he was 18 years old. I
               asked for Jabbi's name and date of birth which he provided
               verbally. As Jabbi spoke I could clearly smell the strong odor
               of intoxicants coming from his breath. As Jabbi stood one of
               his friend was standing behind his right shoulder. Jabbi was
               leaning backwards against his friend for balance. I asked Jabbi
               how much he had to drink tonight and Jabbi said he felt "pretty
               chill." I asked Jabbi if I could check he eyes and he said I
               could. I told Jabbi he would have to stand on his own for the
               test. Jabbi's friend moved away and I asked Jabbi to stand with
               his heels and toes together. Jabbi said "yeah" even though he
               never moved. I told Jabbi several more time to put his heels
               and toes together. When Jabbi finally started to move his feet,
               he fell forwards into me. I was able to stop Jabbi from fully
               falling over by putting my hand on his chest. I stood Jabbi
               back up and took a few steps away from Jabbi. Jabbi was
               continuing to sway forwards and backwards but did not fall
               over. I told Jabbi to follow my pen with his eyes only and keep
               his head still. As soon as I moved my pen Jabbi moved his head
               to follow it. I told Jabbi to keep his head still and only
               follow the pen with his eyes. Again as soon as I started to
               move the pen Jabbi moved his head to follow it. On the third
               attempt Jabbi did keep his head mostly still and I observed

               lack of smooth pursuit and distinct and sustained nystagmus at
               maximum deviation. I asked Jabbi several questions to determine
               his mental status. Jabbi was able to answer all my question
               correctly, however his words were very slurred. Since Jabbi has
               had no prior contacts for alcohol or drugs I told him I would
               be forwarding charges of MIP Exhibiting to the prosecutor.
               Jabbi was released to his two sober friends and they finished
               their walk to Streit Hall. Nothing further. I certify and

               NARRATIVE: On 02/09/14 at approximately 0144 hours, I was
               driving westbound on Colorado Street near the Soccer Field when
               I saw a group of five females walking eastbound on Colorado. I
               noticed one female, later identified as Friday E Guilbert
               04/21/95, was not walking on her own. Friday had a friend on
               either side of her helping her walk. Friday's head was slumped
               over to her right. As I reached the group, Friday and her
               friends appeared to be under the age of 21. As I turned around
               the group walked into the Scott Coman parking lot. As I pulled
               into the lot I noticed that three of the five females were now
               quickly walking in front of Friday. I assumed the three did not
               want to be contacted with Friday as I was pulling in. One of
               the five was still with Friday and was helping her walk by
               holding onto her shoulders. I exited my car and told Friday and
               her friend I needed to talk with them. The two stopped and I
               told Friday that I needed to talk with her because she appeared
               to be very intoxicated. Friday was standing on her own at this
               point and could not keep her balance. Friday had to take
               several forwards and backwards to keep her balance. Due to
               Friday's inability to stand still I asked her several questions
               to determine her mental status. Friday was able to correctly
               tell me where she was and what city she was in. However Friday
               did not know who the President of the United States was and
               when asked what day of the week it was she said, "Thursday." I
               asked Friday what month it was and she replied, "Friday." I
               asked Friday if she had any ID with her and she said no. I
               asked Friday what her first name was and she said Friday. I
               asked for her middle name and Friday said Guilbert. I aksed for
               Friday's last name and she said Guilbert. I again asked about
               her middle name and she said Elizabeth. I asked for Friday's
               date of birth and she said, "Friday." I again asked for her
               date of birth and she provided 04/21/95. As Friday spoke her
               words were very slurred. I also could smell the strong odor of
               intoxicants coming from her breath. I asked Friday if she would
               do a PBT and she said she would as she cried. Friday attempted
               to provide a sample but was not blowing through the straw. I
               explained again how to do the PBT and told Friday to try again.

               I had to manually click the PBT after less than a second
               because Friday was not correctly providing a sample. The PBT
               read .156 off a very weak sample. I again asked Friday a series
               of questions and she could not answer them correctly. I called
               for medics to evaluate Friday. I had Friday and her friend sit
               in the backseat of my patrol car where it was warm. It was
               snowing and windy at the time of my contact. Once medics
               arrived they asked Friday another series of questions and she
               only was able to answer about half of them. Medics said she did
               not need to go to the hospital. I researched Friday's name and
               found that she had been contacted only 23 days earlier by
               Pullman PD for an overdose. PPD Officers reported being sent to
               an intoxication where Friday had become combative with her
               friends while they tried to take care of her. Friday was
               observed to be highly intoxicated but was not arrested since
               she was in an apartment. PPD Officers warned Friday not to
               drink anymore. Due to the prior contact, I issued Friday Sector
               citation 4Z0255355 for MIP Exhibiting. I explained the citation
               to Friday and provided her with her copy. Friday was released
               to her friend who said she would watch over Friday. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 9th day of February, 2014, in Pullman,
