               02/22/14 at approximately 1230 hours I was parked on SE Spokane
               St near SE Washington St. when I saw the defendant's vehicle
               drive south past my location. I noticed the tabs on the vehicle
               were expired (07/13), and I confirmed this on my MDC. I got
               behind the vehicle as it turned left onto E. Main St. I
               activated my emergency lights near Sellas and activated my
               VieVu camera. The vehicle continued traveling east on Main St.
               and got to the red light at Bishop. I turned off my emergency
               lights. As the vehicle turned right onto Bishop I activated my
               emergency lights and the vehicle turned right onto SE Latah St.
               and came to a stop at Mayflower. I contacted the driver and
               advised him the reason for the stop and that the stop was being
               recorded. I asked the driver for his license, registration, and
               proof of insurance. I noticed there were three other passengers
               in the vehicle. While the driver, later identified by WADL as
               Conrad J. Larned 10/06/93, was gathering the documents I could
               smell the odor of fresh marijuana coming from his vehicle.
               After Larned gave me the documents I asked who in the vehicle
               was 21 and Larned said that no one was. I told Larned I could
               smell the odor of fresh marijuana coming from his car. I asked
               Larned how much marijuana was in his car and he said "a dime".
               I asked Larned where the marijuana was and he said in the
               center console. I asked Larned if he had a medical marijuana
               card and he said no. I asked Larned if there was a legal reason
               he should have marijuana and he said no. I asked Larned again
               how much he had and he removed the bag from his console which
               contained marijuana and handed it to me and said I could have
               it. I asked him if there were any pipes in his car and he said
               no. I told Larned to wait in his car and I returned to my
               patrol car. I checked Larned's history in Spillman and noticed
               he had been warned for possession of marijuana on 12/11/13. I
               completed a SECTOR citation for possession of marijuana. I
               returned to Larned and explained that I was issuing him a
               citation for the marijuana and that it was the same as an
               arrest so I advised him of his right to counsel. I explained
               the citation to Larned and provided him a copy. I cleared the
               stop and returned to WSUPD with the marijuana. I tested the

               threatening call. The reporting party, Jack R. Botkins
               06/08/94, said he received two text messages. One said "going
               to kill you" and the other said "i know where you live jack".
               Botkins then received two more texts, one saying "JK" and the
               other "LOL". Those are acronyms for Just Kidding and Laughing
               Out Loud. The text messages came from 401-217-2108. I called
               Botkins and asked if he gave his number out to anyone recently
               and he said no. I told Botkins I would research it and call him
               back. I searched the phone number and learned it was a landline
               number from Rhode Island. I also found that it was a VOIP
               (voice over internet provider). Based off of this I figured
               that someone searched his number and/or name and was playing
               games. I could not find any local matches for the number or any
               information on Facebook. I called Botkins back and told him my
               findings. I told Botkins that I did not think it was a credible
               threat due to the location of the number and the fact the said
               they were just kidding and laughing out loud. Botkins agreed.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 22nd day of February, 2014, in

               bumper corner. Small crack in bumper. NARRATIVE: On 02/22/14 at
               approximately 2343 hours, I was requested by Pullman PD to
               respond to Valley Road and Brandi Way where a Pullman PD
               Sergeant's patrol car had been rear ended. Upon arrival I found
               the patrol car and a Nissan Maxima still blocking the westbound
               lane of travel. I parked about 15 feet behind the Nissan that
               had rear ended the patrol car. When I exited my car I could see
               skid marks on the ground that had a layer of snow and ice on
               it. As I walked up to the scene I noticed the roadway was very
               slick. As I walked up to the vehicles, I was able to see that
               the Maxima had locked up its brakes and rear ended the patrol
               car. The Maxima had attempted go left of the patrol car causing
               the passenger's side front corner of the Maxima to collide with
               the driver's side rear bumper of the patrol car. It is my
               assumption that the driver of the Maxima was trying to avoid
               the collision by going around the patrol car on the left. I
               contacted Sgt. Opgenorth who told me he had noticed a Jeep
               Liberty sideways in on Valley Road. The Jeep appeared to have
               spun out on the slick roadway. Opgenorth was driving WA/52508D
               a 2010 Ford Explorer Patrol Car. The Explorer is a marked
               patrol car with exterior emergency lights. Opgenorth slowed
               down to come to a stop just prior to the intersection of Valley
               Road and Brandi Way when he was rear ended by Samuel Kamau
               Njuguna 09/09/90 who was driving WA/424ZLP a 2000 Nissan
               Maxima. Opgenorth stated he came to a stop gradually and not
               abruptly due to the slick conditions. Opgenorth's emergency
               lights were not activated while he came to a stop. Opgenorth
               stated he was wearing his seatbelt at the time of the
               collision. Opgenorth stated his neck did hurt from the
               collision but did not need medical attention. I took
               photographs of the damage to the patrol car and the Maxima. The
               damage to the patrol car was located on the driver's side rear
               bumper. There were paint scrapes and paint transfer. There also
               was a small crack on the lower half of the bumper. The

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
               estimated value of damage to the patrol car is $500 dollars.
               The damage to the Maxima was located on the passenger's side
               front corner and bumper. There was a fist size hole in the
               plastic bumper where it had made contact with the patrol car.
               The damage to the Maxima is estimated at $800 dollars. I had
               the driver of the Maxima, Samuel Kamau Njuguna 09/09/90, pull
               his car into the Kamiak Apartment parking lot so the road could
               be opened up. Once the cars were moved I interviewed Samuel. I
               asked Samuel what happened and he said the patrol car "slammed
               on his brakes" and he did not have time to stop. Samuel said he
               was wearing his seatbelt at the time of the collision. I Samuel
               stated he was not injured and did not need medical attention. I
               told Samuel that he could be cited with following too close
               however I was not going to write him a citation due to the
               slick road conditions. I provided Samuel with a copy of the
               exchange of information from sector and told him he was free to
               go. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 24th day of February,
               2014 in Pullman, Washington.

               02/23/14 at approximately 0005 hours, Sgt. Jacobson radioed me
               that he had just passed three individuals on Colorado Street
               near the Soccer Fields. Jacobson stated that it looked as if
               one of the females was being carried by the other two. Jacobson
               said he was unable to turn around and saw I was near them. I
               was driving eastbound on Colorado when I found the three
               individuals walking eastbound on Colorado. All three subjects,
               two females and a male, were walking and nobody was being
               carried. I drove past the three and pulled into the Smith Gym
               parking lot. I watched the three as they walked towards me and
               noticed one of the females, later identified as Katie Anne
               Sherman 03/20/95, stood out from the other two. Sherman was
               stumbling side to side as she walked and was bumping into the
               male she was walking next to. As the three neared my location I
               noticed all three appeared to be under the age of 21. I crossed
               the street and approached the three. By this point one female
               was far in front of Sherman and the male. I asked Sherman and
               the male if they had a second to talk. The male stopped but
               Sherman kept walking. I followed Sherman and told her I needed
               to talk to her. Sherman did not stop until I grabbed her by the
               arm. At that point Sherman stopped walking. I explained to
               Sherman what I had observed. I asked Sherman where she was
               walking to and she said "greek row." I explained that she was
               coming from greek row. I again asked where she was walking to
               and Sherman said, "Phi Kapps." Again Sherman's answer was
               incorrect because she was walking in the wrong direction. I
               asked for a third time where she was walking to and Sherman
               said, "my house." I asked where her house was and she
               said,"Scott Coman." It was clear at this point that Sherman was
               confused. I asked Sherman if she had any ID and she said no. I
               asked Sherman how old she was and Sherman said "18." Sherman
               provided her information verbally with a date of birth of
               01/20/95. Sherman was ran through dispatch and no return was
               found. I again asked Sherman about her information and this
               time she provided a date of birth of 03/20/95. I asked Sherman
               why she told me January the first time and not March. Sherman
               said she was sorry, she did not mean that. Sherman kept saying

               that she did not mean to say January. I asked Sherman how much
               she had to drink tonight and she said "not that much." I asked
               Sherman how much was not that much and Sherman recited her
               phone number. I asked Sherman to repeat the question I just had
               asked her and Sherman stated "how much I've had to drink." I
               asked Sherman why she answered the question with her cell phone
               number. Sherman said that was her number. Seeing that Sherman
               was not understanding what I was saying I again asked Sherman
               how much she had to drink. Sherman said she had three drinks
               with her last one being about an hour ago. I asked Sherman a
               series of questions to determine her mental status. Sherman was
               able to answer all of my questions correctly even though it
               took her a little while to answer the questions. As Sherman
               spoke I could clearly smell the odor of intoxicants coming from
               her breath. Sherman's words were also slurred. I asked to check
               Sherman's eyes and she said I could. I performed an HGN test on
               Sherman and observed, equal tracking, lack of smooth pursuit,
               and distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation.
               Sherman's eyes were bloodshot and watery. Sherman was swaying
               side to side as she stood before me. Sherman had not been
               arrested or contacted by the police for alcohol or drugs. I
               told Sherman that I would be forwarding charges of MIP
               Exhibiting to the prosecutor. Sherman said she understood.
               Sherman asked several times if this could be "ignored." I told
               Sherman that it would not be ignored. I told Sherman she was
               free to go. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 23rd day of
               February, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.
