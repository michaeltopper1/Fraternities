               POLICE DEPARTMENT ** COLLISION REPORT ** CASE #: 14-W0555
               SYNOPSIS: Michael J. Alfredson (DOB 08-22-1984) was involved in
               a non-injury vehicle collision. DRIVER 1: Michael J. Alfredson
               (DOB 08-22-1984) VEHICLE 1: black, 2003 Toyota Celica (WA Lic.
               AAB5355) INSURANCE: State Farm / #052 8185-A16-47F / exp. 07-

               front bumper and driver side front quarter panel dented DAMAGE
               VALUE: $1000.00 WITNESS(ES): n/a NARRATIVE: On 02-10-2014 at
               about 0948 hrs I was dispatched to a non-injury vehicle
               collision in the parking lot located on the west side of Rogers
               Hall, 1355 SE Olympia Avenue. Officer Jones and I arrived on
               scene and contacted the following individual, Michael J.
               Alfredson (DOB 08-22-1984). Alfredson was the driver of a
               black, 2003 Toyota Celica (WA Lic. AAB5355). There were no
               other passengers or witnesses. After speaking with Alfredson, I
               determined the following: Alfredson was travelling in the
               roundabout portion of the parking lot near the main entrance to
               Rogers Hall. Alfredson was travelling too fast for the
               conditions, and his vehicle slid on the snow and ice.
               Alfredson's vehicle went straight through the corner of the
               roundabout, and the front bumper of his vehicle collided with
               the front bumper of a parked and unoccupied vehicle. Alfredson
               did not complain of any injuries. The damage to the vehicles
               and tire tracks in the snow were consistent with the
               information provided by Alfredson. Alfredson's vehicle had been
               moved prior to my arrival. Officer Jones photographed the
               vehicles, and the photographs have been downloaded into
               Spillman. I gave Alfredson a verbal warning for speed too fast
               for conditions. The unoccupied vehicle was identified as a
               black, 2003 BMW 325 (WA Lic. AEL9343). The registered owner of
               this vehicle was identified as Zhong Dong (DOB 03-20-1990). I
               left my business card on the driver side window with
               instructions for Dong to contact me. When Dong contacts me, I
               will provide her with information about this collision. No
               further action at this time. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               __10__ day of _February___, 2014 in Pullman, Washington.

               about 1140 hours I was dispatched to a report of threats made
               against the Washington State Employees Credit Union (WSECU) via
               social media. I went over to the CUB Branch and contacted Linda
               Swan. She told me that WSECU found a post on Twitter
               referencing a heist at the CUB branch. She provided me a copy
               of the posting. I found the posting on two (2) Twitter pages.
               The pages belong to Emily Rose Rodgers (05/03/93) and James R.
               Carnes (01/06/92). Both are current WSU students in Pullman.

               Rodgers Tweeted on 2/9/14 @ 3:16 PM: @Jimcarnes3 I think yes,
               get in through the lib parking garage and use women's transit
               as our getaway vehicle (keep this lowkey tho) I spoke with Mike
               Sanders WSECU Security by telephone. He said that WSECU takes
               all threat very seriously. I will follow up with him when I
               have contacted both parties. I interviewed Rodgers at the WSU
               Police Department on February 10, 2014 at about 1337 hours.
               Rodgers came immediately to the WSU Police Department when I
               called her. I spoke with her in the WSUPD interview room. I
               closed the door for privacy as the room is adjacent to the
               lobby and told her that she was free to leave at any time and
               she was not under arrest. She admitted to posting the Tweets on
               her site and on Carnes. Rodgers and Carnes are friends. She
               said she is not going to rob a bank and was just being
               sarcastic. She went on to say she had no intention of robbing a
               bank. I explained the seriousness of the threats made against
               WSECU and the potential charges a person could face. Rodgers
               acknowledged that she understood. She was very apologetic about
               the Tweets. I told her that the FBI has been notified and WSU
               Student Conduct will also be sent my report. I provided Rodgers
               my business card with the case number on it. She said she will
               send me an electronic statement. I told her no criminal charges
               will be filed against her. The investigation continues, Carnes
               still needs to be contacted. I certify and declare under

               SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched to a report of a non-injury vehicle
               collision in a parking lot. DRIVER 1: Lauren R. Peterson (DOB
               04-05-1994) VEHICLE 1: green, 2002 Subaru Forester (CO Lic.
               907UYR) INSURANCE: Geico / #4192-72-47-57 / exp. 04-13-2014

               n/a DAMAGE: no damage DAMAGE VALUE: n/a WITNESS(ES): n/a
               NARRATIVE: On 02-10-2014 at about 1206 hrs I was dispatched to
               a report of a non-injury vehicle collision in the "yellow"
               parking lot located southwest of the intersection of Spokane
               Street and Columbia Street. I arrived on scene and determined
               that an unoccupied vehicle had rolled out of a parking space
               and hit another parked and unoccupied vehicle. The vehicle that
               rolled out of the parking space was identified as a green, 2002
               Subaru Forester (CO Lic. 907UYR). After rolling backwards out
               of the parking space, the rear bumper of the Subaru collided
               with the front brush guard of a black, 1998 Ford F150 (WA Lic.
               B21799F). The Subaru was blocking a lane of travel in the
               parking lot and was resting up against the front of the Ford.
               The registered owner of the Subaru was identified as Lauren R.
               Peterson (DOB 04-05-1994). I contacted Peterson on the
               telephone, and she responded to the scene. I saw that the
               parking brake in the Subaru had not been set, and the
               transmission indicator showed that it was in park. Peterson
               moved her vehicle and parked it in another nearby parking
               space. I gave Peterson a verbal warning for not setting the
               parking brake when she parked her vehicle. The registered owner
               of the Ford was identified as Margarita P. Rodriguez (DOB 07-
               28-1955). I left my business card on the driver side window of
               the Ford with instructions for Rodriguez to call me. When
               Rodriguez contacts me, I will provide her with information
               about the collision. I photographed the scene, and the
               photographs were later downloaded into Spillman. No further
               action at this time. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under

               10-14, I responded to the RED's Office for Streit/Perham to
               meet with Hoodless. Upon my arrival I met with Hoodless and RA,
               Julie A. Johnson (07-06-95). Johnson told me she had an entire
               floor meeting (Streit Hall, 3rd floor) on the evening of 02-09-
               14 regarding cleanliness, keeping the noise level down, and
               being respectful of one and other. Johnson lives in Streit
               Hall, room 326. She said she entered her room on 02-10-14 at
               approximately 0020 hours and did not have any writing on her
               dry erase board, which is attached to the outside of her door.
               When she exited her room at approximately 0830 hours, she saw
               someone had written the word "Fegit", in black, dry erase, ink,
               on her white board. She took a photograph of the word and wiped
               it off. Johnson said she has no idea who wrote the word on the
               white board and was not offended or afraid due to the incident.
               I gave her a Police Case Number and asked her to e-mail the
               photo to me so I could attach it to the case. I also asked her
               to call if she needed any further assistance. Once back at the
               Police Department, I checked my e-mail and noticed I had
               received the photo from Johnson. I downloaded the photo onto
               the WSU Police Computer System. Since there was no damage to
               the white board, the crime of Malicious Mischief is unfounded.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 11th day of February, 2014, in

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 02/10/14 at approximately 2105 hours
               I was dispatched to a trespassing case at Streit Hall 3rd
               floor. The reporting party, RA Marina A. Martin 08/19/93,
               called 911 reporting a male, Joel A. Villela, who had been
               trespassed from all WSU was on the 3rd floor. The RA recognized
               Villela from photos that were given to the RA's to warn them of
               Villela. Villela was served trespass paperwork on 01/31/14 at
               approximately 1700 hours by Cpl. Kuhrt (See case 14-W0375).
               Villea signed the trespass admonition at that time. Upon
               arrival I meet with the RA who told me Villela was in room 331.
               I had looked up several photographs of Villela prior to
               contacting room 331. I walked to room 331 where I found the
               door wide open. I looked inside the room from the hallway and
               saw 4 females and one male. I instantly recognized Villela from
               his photographs. I asked Villella to come talk to me and he
               walked out into the hallway. I asked Villela to speak with me
               in the study lounge for his privacy. Once in the study lounge I
               asked Villela what his first and last name was and he
               identified himself as "Joel Villela." I asked Villela why he
               was on campus. Villela said his attorney told him that he
               cannot be trespassed from campus. I told Villela that he just
               had been served just a few weeks ago with new trespass
               paperwork by Cpl. Kuhrt that clearly stated he could not be on
               the WSU campus. Villela said the paperwork was old. I told
               Villela that he was under arrest for trespassing. Villela was
               handcuffed (D/L) him. I read Villela his Miranda rights off my
               preprinted card. After reading the rights I asked Villela if he
               understood his rights. Villela asked about his right to an
               attorney as if he did not understand it. I again read Villela
               all of his rights. This time Villela said he understood his
               rights and having his rights in mind he still wished to speak
               with me. Villela said that he was told by his attorney that he
               could not be arrested on campus and if he was it would be a
               false arrest. I told Villela that he was just served new
               trespass paperwork that he signed about a week ago. Villela
               said that was the same paperwork as before. I told Villela that

               all my information to this point told me that he had knowledge
               that he was trespassed from all of WSU campus to include Streit
               Hall the building he currently was in. Ofc. Kirshner
               transported Villela to Pullman Holding Facility while I
               returned to the station to fill out a PC booking sheet for
               Villela. Once completed I transported Villela to Whitman County
               Jail. Once out at the Jail I issued Villela Sector citation
               4Z0224491 for RCW 9A.52.070 Criminal Trespass in the 1st
               degree. I explained the citation and had the jailor add the
               citation to the rest of Villela's property. Villela was booked
               into jail and I cleared. My VieVu camera footage was uploaded
               to the department's computer. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               the building where I contacted the complainant, Aaron T. Verhei
               (03-15-91), at the front desk. Verhei told me that just prior
               to calling Whitcom, one of the custodians found three pieces of
               red ink graffiti in one of the stalls in the ground floor men's
               restroom. I photographed the graffiti, which appeared to have
               been written by a red grease pencil. I told Verhei he could
               have the graffiti cleaned. Verhei said he was notified of the
               graffiti just prior to calling Whitcom so he believed it
