               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 020614 around 1620 hrs I was
               dispatched to a report of the odor of marijuana coming from
               room 127 of Goldsworthy Hall. Upon my arrival I was told by the
               reporting party, later identified as Hannah M Mitchell
               (090985), the following. Mitchell explained that she had been
               contact by a hall staff member after noticing an odor that they
               believed to be burnt marijuana coming from room 127. Mitchell
               confirmed the odor and contacted Whitcom. I walked up to room
               127 and could not smell anything around the cracks of the door
               and knocked. The door was answered by the sole occupant, later
               identified as Griffin P Walker. As soon as Walker looked at me
               his eyes became big and then he lowered his head and began to
               breath heavily. I asked him if he knew why I was there and
               initially he did not answer, but after a short period of time
               he told me it was because of the marijuana that he had inside.
               We spoke about this for a short period of at which point I
               advised my of his Ferrier warnings and asked if I could come in
               and talk to him. He agreed and after stepping into his room I
               was told the following. Walker admitted to having smoked
               marijuana in his room and became upset because he believed that
               he was going to be forced to withdraw from classes after this.
               We spoke about this for some time before he told me he would be
               willing to destroy the remainder of his marijuana. We discussed
               this for a period of time before I told him I was going to
               allow him to destroy his marijuana and give him a warning, but
               that I could not promise that hall staff would not forward this
               case to student conduct. I explained to him that I was not
               going to forward this case and shortly after speaking with him
               we walked out to the dumpster where he destroyed the remainder
               of his marijuana before pouring it into the dumpster along with
               his two pipes. After all the items had been destroyed and
               disposed of we returned to the building and I cleared a short
               time later. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 6th day of

               with a red protective cover. He said that it was found on the
               fourth floor of the CUE. I took the phone back to the
               department and found a name written on the inside of the red
               cover, Kariri Kiambuthi. I checked Zzusis for that name and
               found a male, Kariri Tony Kiambuthi DOB 11-04-91, who lives in

               Kiambuthi and the phone I had rang. I went to Stimson Hall room
               128. I saw the name "Kariri" on a nametag attached to the door.
               I knocked but nobody answered. I left my business card with a
               note that the police department had his cell phone stuck in his
               door. At about 2300 hours I went back to Kiambuthi's room. I
               noticed his light was on and the business card I left in his
               door was gone. I knocked several times but nobody answered. I
               returned to the station and completed an evidence form. The
               phone was placed into evidence locker 29 as found property.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury

               as Courtney L. Winston. Winston was dry-heaving and could not
               sit up on her own. She tried to talk but her words were
               slurred. Winston's eyes were closed. I attempted to ask her a
               couple of questions but her friends would answer for her. Two
               females in the hallway, who were not identified, stated that
               they had been with Courtney and that since 2130 hours Courtney
               had consumed three beers, took 3 shots of tequila and then
               started taking "pulls" from the tequila bottle. They estimated
               she did this at least twice, each time taking at least 3 gulps.
               The friends said that the tequila consumption happened in the
               last 45 minutes. In the 15 minutes that I was there I could see
               Courtney becoming more intoxicated and unable to care for
               herself. As soon as the paramedics got there and tried to talk
               to Courtney they made the decision that she would be going to
               the hospital for detox. Courtney was lifted onto the gurney by
               the medics. Student conduct only. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 7th day of
               February, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.
