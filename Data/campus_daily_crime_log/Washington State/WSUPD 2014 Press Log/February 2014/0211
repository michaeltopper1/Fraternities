               NARRATIVE: I responded to the men's bathroom on the first floor
               of Todd Hall for a Malicious Mischief. Upon my arrival I saw
               graffiti, in what looked like red grease pencil, located in the
               handicap stall of the bathroom. I recognized the graffiti as
               being the same writing and design as one I took earlier in the
               morning in the first floor men's bathroom in the Compton Union
               Building. I spoke with the custodian for the first floor of
               Todd Hall, Fredrick W. Cook (02-04-57), who said he found the
               graffiti just prior to calling Whitcom. He has no idea who did
               it or exactly when it happened. I told him I had already taken
               photographs of the graffiti and he could go ahead and clean the
               stall. The graffiti consisted of three identical designs on one
               wall of the stall and another identical, (only smaller) design
               on the toilet paper roll dispenser. Each area of graffiti will
               cost $25.00 to clean for a total of $50.00 Once I returned to
               the WSU Police Department I downloaded the photos onto the WSU
               Police Computer System. There are no witnesses, suspects, or
               leads. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the

               Officer Westerman and I responded. Upon our arrival I could

               room. I knocked on the door several time before the occupant
               Chen answered. When he answered the door the odor got stronger.
               I asked Chen if he knew why we were contacting him and he said
               he did. I asked him why and he said because it is illegal. I
               asked him what was illegal. He said marijuana. I asked him if
               there was any marijuana in the room and he said their was. I
               asked him what he had smoked it with and he said a vaporizer. I
               asked Chen if he would be willing to retrieve the marijuana and
               he said he would. He asked what I was going to do and I told
               him that the he would be destroying the marijuana and I would
               be referring him to student conduct for being in possession of
               marijuana. He reentered the room and when he came back out he
               had a backpack on. We walked to the dumpster outside. I asked
               him if he would open the pack and he said he would. He open the
               pack, reached in and retrieved a small baggie of green
               vegetable material(GVM) and a small plastic container
               containing a small amount of GVM. The content of both items
               were emptied into the dumpster. I told Chen I would be

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 02/12/14 at approximately 0104 hours,
               I was dispatched to a drugs call at Rogers Hall room 539. The
               RED on duty, Griffin J. Uchida, was reporting the odor of
               marijuana coming from room 539. I responded to another drugs
               call at room 539 on 02/08/14 (see case 14-W0532). Upon arrival
               I found room 539 to smell strongly of marijuana. I knocked on
               the door for approximately 7 minutes without answer. Based on
               my prior contact with the room I knew the room belonged to Adam
               Edward Jackson 08/15/95 and Andrese Louis Collins 07/20/95. I
               called Jackson's cell phone without answer. Jackson's voicemail
               was full which did not allow me to leave a message. I called
               Collins cell phone next. Collins did not answer and I left a
               voicemail on his phone with instructions to return my call. I
               also left my business card on their door. This is the second
               incident with room 539 in 4 days. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 12th day of
               February, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.
