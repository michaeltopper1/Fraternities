               WSU STUDENT: XXYES NO OTHER UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 021214 at
               approximately 0717 hours, I was dispatched to the area of
               Streit/Perham to contact WSU Parking Services regarding a lost
               permit being displayed in a car. Upon arrival, I saw a 2012
               Hyundai Elantra parked in the Green 2 parking lot displaying a
               lost Gray 1 permit (GY1-5271). I asked the parking attendant
               (Jack) if he had any other information regarding who owned the
               permit or car. Jack told me he didn't know anything and that I
               needed to go to the parking office for that information. I
               responded to the WSU Parking Office and contacted Aaron Colyer
               who told me that the owner of the lost permit was Chelsey M.
               Martin and she lives in Perham Hall. I asked Colyer if he had
               any contact information for the vehicle and he told me it
               wasn't in their system. I responded to Perham Hall and
               contacted Martin at her room. I asked Martin if she drove a
               silver Hyundai Elantra. She told me she did. I explained that
               it was displaying a reported lost parking permit. She told me
               that in October, she switched cars with her mom and forgot her
               parking permit in her car she left at home. Martin told me that
               she reported the permit lost, because it was at home and she
               needed to park. During Thanksgiving break, she switched cars
               back and switched the permits so she would be using the valid
               one. Martin stated that on 020814 she returned to her parent's
               house because her car needed brakes and switched cars with her
               mom again. She stated that she forgot to switch the permits
               back and was using the reported lost permit until she returned
               home on 021514. I told Martin that her car had a wheel lock on
               it and $550.00 in fines, and she needed to contact WSU Parking
               Services to get it taken care of. She thanked me for the
               information and I left. I contacted Colyer again and told him
               that there was no intent to steal services from parking
               services. I also told him to make sure he receives the lost
               permit when the wheel lock is removed. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 12th day of February, 2014, in Pullman,

               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W0582 SYNOPSIS: Sarah Hannah
               Stephens reported that her ex-boyfriend, Brian C. O. Cox,
               posted a nude photo of her on www.myex.com with her cell phone
               number and since, she has received over 30 text messages and
               phone calls. I contacted Cox and he admitted to posting the
               pictures and is in the process of having them removed. Cox is a
               student of North Park University in Chicago, Illinois. I
               contacted the Dean of Students, Elizabeth Snezek, from North
               Park University and she told me they would deal with
               disciplinary action of Cox. NAME/DOB: Brian C. O. Cox (051794)

               approximately 0930 hours, I was dispatched to contact Sarah
               Hannah Stephens at Pullman PD regarding a report of cyber
               stalking and harassment. Upon arrival, Stephens told me the
               following. On 021114, she received a text message from Brian
               Cox stating the following: "so I think someone hacked my email.
               This shouldn't concern you but while I thought I deleted all
               the pics of you, I guess I had a file buried in my email." Cox
               went on to write, "Well this came to my attention today because
               I saw a little flag in my draft section and they were all
               there. So I think someone copied them." Stephens told him to
               change the password on his email and he agreed. When she woke
               up on 021214, she noticed she had approximately 30 text
               messages and phone calls from numerous people she didn't know.
               She responded to one of the text messages asking how they got
               her phone number and learned that a nude picture of her was
               posted on the internet on www.myex.com with her phone number.
               Stephen told me she went to the website and confirmed that two
               pictures of her were posted on the website and she was labeled
               Hannah Stephen (19 years old in Pullman, Washington) "Dumb ex."
               An anonymous poster labeled the pictures with the following
               statement "Well her name is Hannah, 214 649 7780 n made the
               mistake of following her to college she broke up with me on the
               first day after 1 and a half years hahahaha." Stephens told me
               that she texted Cox and told him to have the pictures removed.
               Cox told her he was trying and had to pay $400.00 to get them
               removed. Stephens asked Cox why he would do this to her and he
               stated, "I'm sorry I did this Hannah." She told me that Cox
               lives in Chicago and is going to a small university there.
               Stephens provided me with Cox's contact information and I told
               her I would look into the case. She told me she would also like

               to seek a protection order from Cox. I explained how to obtain
               a protection order, and told her I would be in contact with her
               in the future. I returned to the WSU Police Department and
               looked up the website www.myex.com. I went to the law
               enforcement section of the website and sent the web
               administrators an email advising that I was investigating a
               cyber stalking case involving Stephen's pictures and asked that
               they be removed immediately. I contacted Cox via telephone and
               explained that I was investigating a cyber stalking case and
               asked him why he posted the pictures. He told me he didn't know
               why he did it. I asked him when he posted them and he told me
               that they were posted sometime between 0000 and 0200 hours
               (central time) on 021214. I asked him about removing the
               postings and he told me he had to pay $410.00 and send the
               money via Western Union to the Philippines where the website
               company is. He told me that he listing should be removed in the
               next 72 hours. I asked Cox if he could prove he paid the money
               to have the pictures removed. He sent me an email confirmation
               receipt from the security company in charge of removal of the
               profiles. Cox told me he is currently attending North Park
               University in Chicago, IL and lives in Sohlberg Hall. I asked
               Cox about having more pictures on his phone or computer and he
               assured me he has deleted them all. I looked up North Park
               University security and found that Dan Goorst is the Director
               of Security. I contacted Goorst advising him of this case. He
               referred me to contact Elizabeth Snezek who is the Dean of
               Students. I contacted Snezek and advised her of this case. I
               explained that I had probable cause for an arrest for Cyber
               stalking in Washington. I asked her if they had a campus police
               department and she told me they didn't. She told me that it
               would probably be best to deal with this through the university
               rather than going through Chicago Police Department because of
               their call volume. I asked her if she would be willing to take
               disciplinary action against Cox in this case, and she told me
               she would. We exchanged information and I told her I would be
               in contact once my investigation was complete. I thanked Snezek
               for her time and ended the call. At approximately 1500 hours, I
               received an email from Stephen that included all the text
               messages between her and Cox where he admitted to her that he
               posted her pictures. I printed the text messages and added them
               to the case file. Case pending picture removal on www.myex.com
               I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws
               of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 12th day of February, 2014, in Pullman,

               NARRATIVE: On 02/12/14 at approximately 1155 hours I was
               dispatched to a fraudulent parking permit in the lot east of
               Spokane St at Columbia St. I arrived on scene and noticed
               parking services had placed a wheel lock on the vehicle's
               passenger rear wheel. The vehicle had a yellow 3 permit in the
               front dash area. The permit number was either YE36101 or
               YE36191 (the lower part of the 0 or 9 was unreadable). I asked
               why they thought the permit was fraudulent and they said
               because of the smeared font in the yellow circle as well as the
               edges being straight and not curved. I had parking services
               check both permit numbers. Both permits came back to people
               with different names than the registered owner of the vehicle.
               I took photos of the plate and permit and saved them to the
               case. I attempted to locate a local name and number for the
               operator of the vehicle and was unsuccessful. I checked the
               parking services database as well as the WSU directory. At this
               point I will have parking services handle the case unless the
               operator does not clear their debt with parking services. At
               approximately 1156 hours I was dispatched to Parking Services
               to contact a subject in their lobby claiming to have the permit
               that was in the car. I responded to Parking Services and
               contacted Steven D. Meyer 08/08/93. I asked Meyer to tell me
               what was going on. Meyer showed me a Yellow 3 permit (YE36191)
               and told me that permit was in his car when it got booted. I
               realized I did not activate my VieVu camera so I turned it on
               and told Meyer I was recording. I told Meyer that I wanted him
               to know that producing and using a fake permit is a felony, and
               making a misleading statement to a police officer is also a
               crime. I asked Meyer to tell me the permit that was in his car
               and he pointed to the YE36191 permit. I told Meyer that I went
               to his vehicle and looked at the permit and knew this was not
               the permit in his car. I looked at Meyer and asked him if I was
               wrong and he said no. Meyer said he was in a hurry so he
               photocopied his friend's permit. I asked Meyer what he did with
               the other permit and he said he tore it up. I gave Meyer the
               permits back and asked if he wanted to talk with the parking
               services employee again and take care of his fines and he said
               he did. I advised Parking Services that he wanted to be honest

               UNIVERSITY POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W0590 SYNOPSIS: On
               07/25/14 at about 0007 hrs Dispatch advised of a report there
               was an intoxicated female who fell down and was unconscious
               outside Streit Hall. Sergent Griffin and I responded. I located
               the female, Evelyn M. G. Martinez (072590), and her boyfriend,
               Erik S. Ostrom (051190), near teh east entrance to Streit Hall.
               Upon my arrival Ostrom was trying to get Martinez up off the
               ground. I told him to step back and asked him to speak with
               Sergeant Griffin. I asked Martinez what was going on and how
               much she had to drink. Martinez was conscious but not making
               much sense, talking about students chasing her and being
               persecuted. She was clearly intoxicated. Ostrom said they had
               been drinking at a bar and had a disagreement. Martinez got mad
               at him and left. He did not find her until she was already
               laying on the ground outside Streit Hall. Pullman Ambulance
               arrived on scene and determined Martinez could walk home with
               Ostrom. Since Ostrom was intoxicated as well I advised him he
               should not be driving, since he admitted to arriving by car.
               His car was not legally parked on Colorado St. so I moved it to
               a legal spot in the Regents parking lot. Nothing further.

               could clear, which we did a short time later. Pullman Ambulance
