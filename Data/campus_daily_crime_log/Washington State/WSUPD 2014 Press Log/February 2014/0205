               I was traveling south on NE Stadium Way near NE Harvey Dr. I
               ran the plate of the vehicle in front of mine (WA AGV8130) and
               it returned to Christa L. Hernandez. I ran Hernandez's driving
               status and she returned suspended. The vehicle turned right
               onto Duncan Ln and I activated my emergency lights. I asked the
               driver if she was Christa and she said she was. I asked Christa
               for her WADL and she provided it identifying her as Christa L.
               Hernandez 05/28/87. I advised Hernandez her license was
               suspended. I told Hernandez she was under arrest and advised
               her of her right to counsel and reminded her the stop was being
               recorded. I issued Hernandez a criminal citation for DWLS. I
               explained the citation to her and provided her a copy. I
               allowed Hernandez to pull her car forward 10 feet and park it.
               Hernandez called her mom to pick her up. I returned to the
               station and saved my video to the computer. I certify and

               cost. I called Autobody Supercenter and asked how much their
               tow was. I told the driver of the vehicle, Shaquana A. Logan
               01/04/91, and she requested they tow her vehicle. I asked
               Whitcom to contact Autobody Supercenter for a tow and they did.
               Autobody Supercenter arrived and towed the vehicle. I notified

               described as a male about 5'7" wearing a blue and gray jacket
               and jeans. WSUPD has received several complaints about a
               similar subject in the area. Sgt. Macy and I checked the area
               but could not locate him. We checked Krugel/McAllister Hall and
               Flix and the surrounding lots. We spoke with several employees
               of McAllister about the situation. At this time no crime has

               concerned for him. I contacted Whitcom and had them create an

               02-05-14 at about 1550 hours I was dispatched to the report of
               a two vehicle non-injury collision. The RP, Kasee J.
               Hildenbrand, stated that the collision occurred near the small
               parking lot in front of Smith Gym and both vehicles were on
               scene. I arrived and contacted Hildenbrand. She told me that
               she was stopped at the pay station, paying for her parking at
               the Library parking garage booth. She said as she was paying a
               blue Buick ran into the back of her. She pointed the car out to
               me which was now in a parking stall. Hildenbrand said that she
               was not injured but her neck was a little bit sore. I saw that
               the only damage to Hildenbrand's vehicle was a bent hitch
               cover. Hildenbrand provided her driver's licenes, registration
               and proof of insurance. I contacted the other driver,
               identified as Hamed R.H. Al Shamaki. He told me that he was
               exiting the parking garage and when he tried to stop at the pay
               booth the vehicle slid on the ice. I asked Al Shamaki how fast
               he was going. He said 20 MPH. I told Al Samaki that was too
               fast for the conditions and he needed to slow down. I asked Al
               Shamaki if he was injured and he said no. I noticed the only
               damage to his vehicle was a broken plastic piece on the
               underside of the front bumper. I asked Al Shamaki for his
               driver's license, registration and insurance. He was not able
               to provide current insurance. I issued Al Shamki a Sector
               infraction for not having proof of current insurance. I
               explained the infraction to him and gave him a copy. I also
               gave him my business card with the case number. I gave
               Hildenbrand my business card with the case number and the other
               driver's information. I tried to take pictures of both vehicles
               but my camera batteries died after taking 2 photos of
               Hildenbrand's car. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 5th day of

               male was found outside Honors Hall who might have hypothermia.
               Officer Westerman and I responded. Upon my arrival I found a
               male, later identified as Saeed M. Talib (121777), laying near
               the north east entrance of Honors Hall. Talib was laying just
               south of the stairwell at the north east corner of the
               building. He was face down, with his head pointed down hill,
               yelling something which was incoherent. I asked him if he was
               injured and he said he was not. He said he was just cold. I
               attempted to have Talib stand up so I could assist him in
               moving closer to the building or to my car while we waited for
               the ambulance to arrive. As I spoke to Talib I could smell a
               strong odor of intoxicants and it was clear he was intoxicated.
               His speech was slurred and his eyes bloodshot. Talib was unable
               to care for himself at all and was unable to even attempt
               standing. I pulled him down the hillside and had him sit up
               against my leg while we waited for the ambulance. He could not
               tell me his name, where he lived, what he was drinking, or
               where he had been walking to. Looking at the snow next to the
               stairwell it was clear Talib fell in the snow at the top of the
               stairs and rolled/slid down the hill to where he was when I
               found him. The fall was likely due to his high level of
               intoxication. There was no ice on the sidewalk above and some
               very small spots of ice on the stairs, which were not enough to
               cause difficulty walking up or down. I photographed the area.
               Talib was cooperative until we placed him on the cot to take
               him to the ambulance. At that point he became physically
               resistive, refusing to sit back on the cot and tensing his
               arms. I rode in the ambulance to the hospital an assisted the
               ambulance personnel in holding Talib down on the cot. Once at
               the hospital we placed Talib in arm restraints because he
               continued to try and sit up/move around. After clearing the
               hospital I was able to find Talib's address in the WSU computer
               system. I went to his apartment at Yakima Village to see if he
               had any family who needed to be notified of his whereabouts. I
               knocked several times with no answer. Nothing further. I
