               approximately 2134 hours, I responded to Streit Hall where the
               RED on duty, Aubrie L. Piper 11/29/87, was reporting several
               males being aggressive towards an RA. Upon arrival I found RA
               Briana Naja Welsh 02/01/93 and Piper standing in front of room
               404. When I walked up to room 404 the door was open and I saw
               three males inside the room. The three males were later
               identified as Grayson Patrick Gebhard 12/24/94, Zachary James
               Winkelman 03/29/95, and Braydon Wesley Gosse 08/29/95.
               Winkelman was the only person assigned to room 404. As Welsh
               was speaking to the three males, Gebhard was arguing with
               Welsh. I asked Gebhard to come speak with me outside of the
               group. Gebhard got up angrily and said, "why do I always have
               to talk to the Police." I told Gebhard that I wanted to get his
               side of the story. I told Gebhard that he was being recorded.
               Gebhard said he had went to Winkelman's room for only an minute
               when the RA Welsh knocked on the door. Welsh said that they
               were being too loud in the room and they were going to be
               written up for a noise complaint. Welsh asked for Gebhard's
               cougar card and Welsh said he gave it to her. Gebhard stated he
               wanted to leave the room to go study for a test but Welsh said
               he could not leave. Gebhard admitted he was being rude to Welsh
               because he was upset. Gebhard said Welsh was giving him
               attitude so therefore he gave Welsh attitude back. Gebhard was
               upset with the situation. I told Gebhard that he was free to go
               and he went to his room. I next spoke with Winkelman. I told
               Winkelman that he was being recorded and asked him what
               happened. Winkelman said they were in his room watching
               Superbowl highlights too loudly and RA's came for a noise
               complaint. Winkelman said he did not hear the RA's knocking
               right away but did eventually open the door. Winkelman said he
               complied with the RA's. I asked Winkelman what happened after
               he opened the door. Winkelman said he did not know. I asked
               Winkelman what he saw and Winkelman said he did what was asked
               of him and I would have to talk to Gebhard about what happened.

               Winkelman was providing me with short answers and not fully
               explaining the situation. I asked Winkelman if he spoke with
               the RA's and he said yes. I asked what he said and Winkelman
               replied, "I complied with their requests." I asked how long the
               RA's were talking with them. Winkelman said about 7 or 8
               minutes. I told Winkelman that 7 to 8 minutes is a long time
               not to remember was was said. Winkelman said he did not know
               what I wanted him to tell me. It was clear that Winkelman was
               not going to fully cooperate. As Winkelman spoke I could smell
               the odor of intoxicants coming from his breath. I told
               Winkelman that he was free to go but he stood in the hallway
               with Gosse. I next spoke with Gosse. I asked Gosse what
               happened. Gosse said they were in the room when RA's knocked on
               the door for a noise complaint. Grosse said Gebhard was talking
               back to the RA's and giving them attitude. I asked Winkelman if
               he had a roommate and he said no. I told Winkelman that I would
               like to give him the opportunity to turn over any alcohol he
               had in his room. Winkelman thought about this for a second and
               said, "I don't see why you think there is alcohol in my room."
               I told Winkelman that if they were watching the game in his
               room and he smells of alcohol there most likely is alcohol in
               his room. Winkelman said he did not have any in his room.
               Winkelman asked if he was free to go and I asked Winkelman what
               I told him earlier. Winkelman said I told him he was free to go
               and I again confirmed he was free to go. Winkelman started to
               walk off and I told him he was being referred to student
               conduct. I spoke with RA Welsh as RED Piper stood by. I asked
               Welsh what happened. Welsh contacted room 404 and knocked on
               the door. The people inside turned down the tv and were quiet.
               Welsh identified herself a the RA on duty and knocked again.
               Winkelman opened the door slightly and Welsh asked for his
               cougar card because of the noise complaint. Winkelman attempted
               to shut the door so he could look for his cougar card and Welsh
               told Winkelman that he needed to open the door all the way.
               Winkelman eventually did open the door. Winkelman said she
               asked for everybody's cougar cards. Gebhard walked up to Welsh
               and threw his cougar card at Welsh. Welsh had a binder open in
               her hands and the cougar card landed on the binder. Welsh said
               this is when Gebhard began to have an attitude. Welsh said
               Gebhard tried to walk past Welsh who was standing in the
               doorway of the room. Welsh told Gebhard that he could not leave
               and prevented him from doing so. Welsh said Gebhard was still
               being uncooperative. Welsh said at that point she called for
               the RED. Welsh said that Winkelman and Gebhard provided their
               cougar cards but Gosse gave his information verbally. Gosse
               provided the name "John Holt" with the WSU student
               identification number of "11381177." Welsh did not know that
               Gosse had lied about who he was until she overheard Gosse
               identify himself to me. I later looked up student ID number
               11381177 which belonged to a Victoria Martinez. Welsh said she
               was not assaulted at any point. I spoke with Welsh about
               preventing people from leaving their rooms. I explained that if
               she prevents people from leaving their rooms she could be
               charged with false imprisonment. I also mentioned that when
               RA's try to put themselves between a student and something

               and Piper with my business card and case number. Gebhard,
               Winkelman, and Gosse all will be referred to student conduct.

               NARRATIVE: On 02/02/14 at approximately 2200 hours, I responded
               to Columbia Village apartment N45 where Grace M. Succo 09/15/94
               was reporting that her ex-roommate, Isabel B. Jones 07/25/94,
               had trashed her living room while she was watching the Seahawks
               win the Superbowl. When Jones came home around 2100 and found
               furniture moved around. Upon my arrival Succo answered the door
               and invited me in. As I walked into the apartment's living
               room, the only items I found in the living room was a table and
               chairs, a bookcase, and a wall clock. The wall clock was laying
               on the ground. Succo said when she left her apartment the table
               and small bookshelf had been against the wall and now they were
               out in the middle of the room. Succo said nothing had been
               damaged but that was not the way she had left it. Succo said
               her roommate had just moved out of the apartment over the last
               few days and believed she had did it. Succo said Jones and her
               have had problems in the past and Jones had tried to frame her
               for stealing items. Succo stated she wanted this incident
               documented. Succo said she was going to contact Housing about
               changing the door locks. Succo also stated that she did not
               know if Jones was off the lease or not. I provided Succo with
               my business card and case number. I told Succo if Jones comes
               back to the apartment and causes issues to call 911. I called
               Jones via cell phone and asked her about the incident. Jones
               said that she had moved a couch out of the apartment earlier
               and had to move a small bookshelf out of the way. Jones said
               she did not move it back. Jones also said she went to the
               apartment around 1900 hours to get her last item in the
               apartment, a bicycle. Jones said she was turning in her keys to
               housing in the morning and was not going back to the apartment
               again. Jones account of the incident matches what I saw in the
               apartment. It appeared that items were moved around but not
               maliciously. No items were damaged but rather nicely moved
               around the room. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 2nd day of

               the vehicle in front of me, WA 675XZB, had its back window

               proof of insurance and vehicle registration in the car. I
               parked Feng's vehicle for him in a legal parking space. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 03 day of February, 2014, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer
