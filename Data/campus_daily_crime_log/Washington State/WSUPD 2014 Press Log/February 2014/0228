               NARRATIVE: On 02/27/14 I was notified by email of a case of
               possible child abuse. The email originated from an incident
               report turned in by hall staff of Community/Duncan Dunn. The
               request to follow up came from the Dean of Students. I attached
               the original email to the case file. A summary of the report is
               as follows: On 02/11/14 at approximately 2140 hours Madeline
               Marsh went to her RA's (Jade Walter) and was crying. Walter
               spoke with Marsh about what was going on and learned that Marsh
               had been working with her RTA (Residential Technology
               Assistant) on some homework issues. Marsh said she felt the RTA
               was annoyed and this "triggered" memories of being home. Marsh
               explained that at home when people get annoyed it resulted in
               verbal and physical violence. Marsh went on to tell Walter that
               back at home (Edgewood WA) she had called the police on her mom
               once. The police investigated and said that no crime had
               occurred and it would fall under corporal punishment. Marsh
               said that due to this incident she was grounded and subjected
               to what her family called "Amish Land". This consisted of her
               mom taking away pillows, lamps, and all electronics. Marsh
               spoke with Walter for approximately 30 minutes and was felling
               better and went back to her room. On 02/27/14 I spoke with
               Walter. During my conversation, nothing more than what was
               discussed in the email came up. I asked Walter if she thought
               Marsh would be willing to talk with me. Walter said she would
               talk with Marsh and have her schedule a meeting with me. At
               approximately 2200 hours I received an email from Marsh saying
               she would stop by the police department at 0915 hours on
               02/28/14. I met with Marsh at approximately 0915 hours on
               02/28/14. I explained to Marsh that I was following up on an
               allegation that was made and explained the process of how
               reports funnel through different University departments. I told
               her I had a duty to follow up on certain allegations and he
               incident fell under that. I told Marsh I wanted to talk with
               her about her interaction with Walter. Marsh said she knew what
               I was talking about and felt bad about the situation. I spoke
               with Marsh for approximately 30 minutes about the report. Marsh
               talked to me further about the "Amish Land" incident. Marsh
               said this occurred when her and her mom would yell at each

               other and eventually her mom would remove all "excess" items
               from her room and they would compare it to living like the
               Amish. While Marsh was explaining this to me she was laughing
               about it. I asked Marsh if her mom took everything out of her
               room including clothing. Marsh again laughed and said it was
               not that extreme. Marsh said the last time she remembered this
               happening was when she was 17, about a year and a half ago.
               Marsh said it was in July and there fore really wasn't that
               cold. I asked Marsh if she looked back at it now, does she feel
               it was as bad as she thought it was at the time and she said
               no. I asked Marsh if there was ever any physical violence.
               Marsh told me that "technically" there was. Marsh spoke about
               the incident when she called the police. I asked Marsh if her
               mom had punched her or anything similar. Marsh said that it was
               more of a scratching thing because her mom had long nails. I
               asked Marsh if her mom came at her flailing her arms. Marsh
               said it was more that she held on to her arm and because of her
               nails scratched her. Marsh went on to tell me that she loves
               her mom, but always seems to argue with her when at home. I
               asked Marsh why her mom argues with her. Marsh said he mom
               comes home stressed from work. I asked Marsh what her mom did
               for a job. Marsh said she works with dementia and alzheimers
               patients. I asked Marsh if she thought that might be a
               stressful job and she said yes. I asked Marsh if she felt safe
               going home and she said she did, but knew she would get in
               arguments with her mom. I re-iterated to Marsh that the
               University is able to provide housing during breaks (as she was
               already told by hall staff). Marsh said since she already made
               arrangements to go home that would probably make it worse if
               she backed out. I suggested to Marsh that she go to counseling
               services. I told Marsh they could probably help her with ways
               to assist with defusing her situations at home before they
               result in an argument. I asked Marsh if there was anything else
               I could do to help her and she said no. During my talk with
               Marsh she was very relaxed and did not seem to be bothered by
               her home life. Marsh specifically noted that she felt bad about
               her encounter with the RTA and hoped he did not get in trouble
               about the situation since he did nothing wrong. I asked Marsh
               if she had spoke with the RTA since and she said she had. No
               crimes have occurred and the abuse allegation is unfounded. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 28th day of February, 2014, in Pullman,

               report of a theft. I contacted the reporting party, Robert C.
               Cole (Director Construction Services), and was told the
               following. Cole was contacted by the Heather Lopez (Director of
               Internal Audit) and was advised the Auditor's office received
               an anonymous whistleblower complaint on one of his employees
               (Michael Pope). The report alleged that Pope was seen driving
               his WSU vehicle to his residence which is located on Shaper Rd.
               which is 1/2 mile east of the Moscow city limits. An inquiry
               (the report states there is not enough details to pursue an
               investigation) was started by Lopez and she contacted Pope
               about it. In Lopez's report Pope denies having driving his WSU
               vehicle to his residence. I do not have a specific date when
               the anonymous complaint was filed. I learned that Cole's
               supervisor, Dan Costello (Assistant VP Facility Operations) was
               contacted by Marge Shaper on 08/27/14 at approximately 1435
               hours. Shaper told Costello that Pope was observed on Shaper Rd
               on 02/24/14 at approximately 0920 hours, unloading materials
               from a WSU vehicle. Shaper was concerned about being involved
               in an investigation because she is Pope's neighbor. I asked
               Cole if Pope works with items that would be identifiable as
               belonging to WSU. Cole said that most likely the items would
               not be identifiable and they would be "low end" items, such as
               fixtures and other electrical items (Pope is a Fac Ops
               Electrician). On 02/28/14 at approximately 1930 hours I spoke
               with Shaper on the phone. I asked her to tell me more about her
               report to Fac Ops. Shaper explained that she has only seen Pope
               drive his work vehicle home once, but her husband (Ed) and
               brother in law have seen Pope drive his vehicle home many times
               over the past 2 years. Shaper was able to provide me with the
               specific address of the incident which is 3305 Shaper Rd.
               Shaper explained that this property was in Pope's family and
               another person had been living in a trailer on the property,
               but Pope had built a residence and shop there. Shaper explained
               that during the summer of 2013 Ed was invited over to Pope's
               shop. Ed told Shaper that he saw many light fixtures in the
               shop, which he thought was suspicious. Shaper explained that it
               seemed like the fixtures were possibly items that should have

               been surplused. Shaper said the most recent occurrence happened
               on 02/26/14 at approximately 0915 hours. Shaper said Ed told
               her that he saw two WSU vehicles at Pope's residence, a van and
               a truck. Shaper said Ed saw two people unloading items into
               Pope's shop. I explained to Shaper that I would be continuing
               my investigation and would contact her and Ed at a later time.
               I thanked her for her information and told her I would do my
               best to keep her involvement out of the investigation. I
               updated Cole and Costello with the information I received.
               Investigation continues. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 1st day of March,

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On February 28, 2014 at about 1724 hours
               I came across a blocking disabled vehicle on Larry Street near
               Grand Ave. The driver and another good Samaritan were
               attempting to push the vehicle up the hill out of the lane of
               traffic. I assisted them with pushing the car out of traffic.
               Li Zhang (06/04/90) told me he just picked up the vehicle,
               ADN6152/WA, from Wysup. He thinks that it is not fully repaired
               and needs to go back. Pullman Police were made aware of the

               NARRATIVE: On February 28, 2014 at about 1746 hours I was
               dispatched to a threatening report at the WSU Police
               Department. I responded to the WSU Police Department where I
               contacted the victim/complainant, Stephen P. Jones (08/18/94).
               I took Jones into the interview room located in the front
               lobby. Jones said he had been in an eleven (11) year
               relationship with his ex girlfriend Morgan M. Stone (09/06/95).
               She broke up with Jones on Wednesday, February 19, 2014. I
               asked Jones how old he was. He replied 19. I then clarified
               that he has been dating Stone since he was eight (8) years old.
               He said "yes". Since the breakup on the 19th, Jones has been
               calling Stone to discuss their past relationship. Stone however
               does not have a cell phone. Jones was calling Stone's new
               boyfriend Paul M. Davis to speak with Stone. He said he called
               a couple of times but the call always went to voicemail. On
               either Thursday, February 20, 2014 or Friday, February 21, 2014
               Jones received a telephone call from the Stone. She called him
               from Davis's phone, 509-789-0729. Stone specifically told Jones
               that Davis will come down and kill him if he does not stop
               calling her. Jones said he heard Davis say "Yeah" in the
               background. I asked Jones why he waited so long to report the
               threat. He said that he saw a tan Subaru tonight and thought it
               was Davis's and it scared him. He soon realized the car he saw
               tonight did not belong to Davis. Jones went on to tell me both
               Davis and Stone live together at an unknown location believed
               to be in Airway Heights, WA. They both work for UPS in Airway
               Heights and are not WSU students. Jones described Davis as a
               fat, short guy with a red beard who is in his late 20's or
               early 30's. Jones went on to tell me Davis ran away from
               Kentucky. He may have past gang affiliation, his driving
               privileges are suspended or revoked, and he may be abusing food
               stamps. I asked Jones if he felt threatened. He said he is not
               severely afraid for his life but worried if Davis would be
               willing to follow through. I followed up with Jones by asking
               what he wants to have happen. He said Davis should go to jail
               for a little while. Jones has never met Davis in person. He has
               a photo of Davis from Facebook on his phone. Jones said he will
               email me the photos. Jones provided me a brief written

               statement that has been placed in the case file. I provided
               Jones with brochures from ATVP on stalking and protection
               orders. I educated Jones on protection orders. I asked Jones if
               he had a problem with me contacting Davis. He said "no." The
               investigation continues. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 28th day of February,

               NARRATIVE: On 02/28/14 at approximately 1800 hours I was
               dispatched to a non injury collision on SE Olympia Ave at the
               playfields. I responded to the area and could not locate any
               collision there (case 14-W0815). At approximately 1815 hours I
               was dispatched to a disabled vehicle on SE Olympia Dr. east of
               Forest Way. I responded and located a vehicle off the roadway
               down the hill. I saw two subjects walking to the west towards
               me. I pulled to the side of the road and activated my rear
               emergency lights and my VieVu camera. I asked the two of them
               what happened and if they were injured. Both subjects said they
               were not injured and their friend's car went off the roadway. I
               asked who was driving and they pointed towards another male by
               the car who began to walk towards me. I collected WADLs from
               all three and they were identified as Dmitriy Alexandrov,
               Asifur Bhuiyan, and Tony Truong. I asked Alexandrov if he was
               driving and he said yes. I asked him what happened. Alexandrov
               said he was traveling west from the intersection (4 way stop)
               and he said a small animal ran out in front of his car and he
               swerved to avoid it and he went off the road. I asked
               Alexandrov how fast he was going when this happened and he said
               20MPH and said he was not speeding. Based upon my training and
               experience on collision investigations, vehicle mechanics, and
               basic physics knowledge I knew Alexandrov was lying to me. I
               asked for Alexandrov to walk with me and point where he left
               the roadway (which I could see already due to tire marks).
               Alexandrov pointed where the tire marks in the gravel and dirt
               were on the south side of the road. This is approximately 20
               yards from the intersection. I noticed a large amount of gravel
               spray and deep groves and continued gravel/mud spray in the
               ground. I followed the tracks as they went approximately 30
               yards off the road and down a light hill. The roadway was dry
               and clear. I told Alexandrov that if he accelerated
               appropriately from the intersection he would have been going
               only 15-20MPH at this location where he left the road. I told
               him even if he was doing the speed limit (20MPH) and an animal

               ran out in front of him he would have been able to stop in
               approximately 20 feet. The tire marks in the gravel and dirt
               would not have been a spray, but more of a slid/gouge in the
               ground. The spray indicated to me he was accelerating rapidly
               and continued to accelerate as he left the roadway. I told
               Alexandrov that he was lying to me and to tell me what really
               happened. Alexandrov said he was trying to show off for his
               friends and lost control of his vehicle leaving the roadway.
               Alexandrov said they then tried to push his car back onto the
               roadway, but couldn't. I walked to his vehicle and noticed
               there was no damage to the vehicle. I took photos of the
               vehicle and later saved them to the case. I noticed a backpack
               in the vehicle and asked who the backpack belonged to and he
               said one of his friends that went back to the dorm. I asked
               Alexandrov how many people were in the car and he said five. At
               about this time two other individuals walked up to the scene. I
               asked the female, identified by WADL as Alyssa Arakaki where
               she was sitting and she said in the back seat. I asked the
               male, verbally identified as David Jung, where he was sitting
               and he said he wasn't in the car. I looked at Alexandrov and
               told him to talk to Jung about lying while I turned my back to
               them. I heard Alexandrov tell Jung that I already knew. I
               turned back around and asked Jung where he was sitting and he
               said in the back seat. I asked if they were injured and they
               said no. Alexandrov had called Autobody Super Center and they
               arrived on scene and pulled the car back onto the roadway. I
               told the group it was a bad idea to drive over their abilities
               and to not lie to the police because we are smart. I told
               Alexandrov I would forward the case to WSU grounds and let them
               decide if he would have to reimburse them for damages. I
               cleared and returned to the scene during day light hours on
               03/01/14 and took photos. It did not appear to be damage other
               then tire marks in the dirt. I saved the photos to the case. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 1st day of March, 2014, in Pullman,

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 03/01/14 at about 0059 hrs I was
               stopped for a stop light on Stadium Way at Nevada St. when I
               noticed three females, who were crossing Stadium Way toward
               McAlister Hall. They caught my attention because one of them,
               later identfied as Jennifer Chhan (03/28/95), appeared to be
               under the age of 21 and was having difficulty walking. She was
               stumbling side to side even though the other females were
               holding her arms. I contacted Chhan as they were entering the
               parking lot. I asked where she was going and she said to her
               dorm. I asked how much she had to drink and she admitted to
               having had some wine. I asked if I could check her eyes to see
               how much she had to drink and she agreed. I administered a
               horizontal gaze nystagmus test on her and observed she had
               bloodshot and water eyes, a lack of smooth pursuit, and a
               distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation. I had to
               remind Chhan not to move her head during the test. I could
               smell the odor of intoxicants on Chhan's breath as I
               administered the test. I asked Chhan if she had any ID with her
               and she said she did not. She provided me with her name and
               date of birth, which I confirmed through Dispatch. The date of
               birth provided confirmed she was under 21. I advised Chhan I
               would be forwarding charges to the Whitman County Prosecutor
               for MIP exhibiting. I offered Chan the opportunity to provide a
               breath sample on a PBT and she declined. I identified one of
               Chan's friends as Alyssa J. Sybouts (080195). Sybouts agreed to
               keep an eye on Chan for the evening. Chan was released. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 01 day of March, 2014, in Pullman,

               14 at approximately 0149 hours, I was traveling west bound on
               Colorado St near the Scott/Coman parking lot when I observed a
               male standing inside the construction site fence line. I backed
               up and pulled into the parking lot and exited my vehicle
               activating my Axon camera. As I did, the male looked at me and
               began walking quickly away from me towards the north side of
               the fence line. At one point it appeared he was trying to hide
               behind some of the construction material. I then observed him
               continue walking quickly away from me. He then began to jump
               the fence and when he landed on the outside, it appeared he was
               going to run from me. I turned my flashlight on him and told
               him, "stop police". The male stopped and turned towards me. I
               asked him for his identification and he said he didn't have
               any. I walked around him to see if he had a wallet in his
               pocket, but he did not. I asked him why he was inside the
               fenced area and he stated he was just trying to go home and
               pointed back towards the gyms. I observed he appeared to be
               under the age of twenty one, had the odor on intoxicating
               beverages emitting from his breath as he spoke, was swaying
               while talking to me, and had slurred speech. He appeared
               extremely nervous and stated he was just trying to go home
               several times. I asked him how old he was and he stated again
               that he was just trying to go home. When I asked him his age
               again, he stated he didn't want to answer the question. I asked
               him his name and he stated he didn't want to answer. I advised
               him to turn around and place his hands behind his back. He
               asked if he was being detained and I said yes. I began to grab
               his left wrist and at first he tightened up and felt like he
               was going to try and pull away. I handcuffed him and double
               locked the handcuffs. I asked him again for his age and he said
               he didn't want to answer. I advised him he was under arrest for
               Criminal Trespass and he had the right to an attorney. I walked
               him to Ofc. Boyd's patrol vehicle as he had just pulled up to
               the area. I searched the male and placed him in the rear of the

               patrol vehicle. As we were walking to the car he said his name
               was Daniel. With him in the back seat, I asked him for his name
               and date of birth. He identified himself as Daniel James
               Goodfellow dob 10-08-94. I advised him he was also being
               charged with Minor Exhibiting in a Public Place. Ofc. Boyd
               transported Daniel to Pullman PD and placed him in a holding
               cell. I walked around the outer perimeter of the fence and
               found where Daniel had climbed the fence to get in as there was
               a fresh footprint in the snow. On either side of where he
               climbed over, about five feet in both directions, were signs
               posted "Danger Construction Area Keep Out". I did not find any
               openings in the fence. In order to enter the fence, he would
               have had to climb the fence. I was unable to access the area
               inside the fence to see if anything had been damaged, but did
               not believe anything was damaged. I later contacted Daniel at
               Pullman PD where I issued and explained his Criminal Citation
               to him. I asked him if he had any questions and he said no. I
               asked him if he wanted a ride home and he said no. He was cited
               and released. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 1st day of March, 2014, in
               Pullman, Washington. _______________________________________
