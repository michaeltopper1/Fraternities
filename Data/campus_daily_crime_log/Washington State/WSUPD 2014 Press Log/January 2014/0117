               ____YES ____NO OTHER UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On January 17, 2104
               at about 1024 hours I was dispatched to the report of a female
               being stalked by a male and would like police contact. I
               initially called the complainant/victim, Francesca A. Bordonaro
               (01/20/95), by telephone. I later met in person with Bordonaro
               and Hannah Mitchell, Stevens Hall Residential Education
               Director in Stevens Hall. Bordonaro told me that a male has
               been following her, waiting for her after classes, and left a
               gift for her in front of her dorm room door. She no longer
               wants contact with the male and has told him several times to
               not contact her. Bordonaro identified the male suspect as
               Andrew M. Clark (04/25/94). He is a WSU student. They have
               choir and voice classes together this semester. Bordonaro met
               Clark at the beginning of the 2013-14 school year in August
               2013. Mitchell had typed up the following notes as Bordonaro
               talked with her prior to my arrival: Franki meeting 9:49 Andrew
               Clark 011334011 He is in Choir with her Lives off campus He was
               cute and so they talked and he instantly took that as wanting a
               relationship He hacked into her phone and changed her fb status
               to say they were in a relationship (during dead week she
               thinks, right after thanks giving) He said he did it and hid it
               because he knew she wouldn't like it. A few days later he
               cornered her in honors lounge and told her he had depression
               and gets very angry and girls in high school didn't like him. A
               few days after the incident with FB and in Honors she told him
               that she wasn't looking for a relationship with him that they
               can be friends and still talk. He said ok that's fine you want
               to be single we can be friends. Started texting her a lot,
               trying to get her to talk to him When she wouldn't answer his
               text he would come to hillside dinning center to look for her,
               the music building. He told her that when she doesn't answer he
               goes looking for her places he thinks she might be looking for
               her. Asked him to give her space and leave her alone several
               times. These conversations started last semester before break.
               She hasn't specifically stated that he is making her
               uncomfortable or scaring her. Just stated I don't want to be
               friends like this. Yesterday was the fourth time she has told
               him to leave her alone. The third time she told him at honors,

               he came back to her class the next day and said "I'm sorry I
               was being weird yesterday, I have a lot of depression" Started
               waiting outside of all her classes for her this semester, has
               no idea how he found out where and when all her classes are.
               Yesterday (1/16/14) she was sitting in Kimbro and he showed up
               because he knew she had classes there, and he came and sat next
               to her and kept poking her and touching her when she was
               talking with someone else. She tried ignoring him in a polite
               way only responding to him with one word answers. She moved
               away and told him to stop in regards to touching her and he
               persisted. (1/16/14) Another resident let him in and escorted
               him to her door and he left her a present full of a bunch of
               notes that say a few words each, inside were brownies, cat food
               and a poem that said : "A poem for Franki, Roses are black,
               violets are black, everything is black, I cant see anything -
               Stevie Wonder" and on the back... "Except you : )" After that
               she texted him and told him "I want you to leave me alone and
               stop talking to me, you feel differently then I feel about you.
               For both of our sakes leave me alone" And he texted back "I
               know" and then "Next time just fucking tell the guy in person"
               1/17/14- she has a class today at 1 and she thinks hes going to
               be there. She has at this point changed her routs to classes to
               avoid him. She is concerned that she doesn't know how he will
               react if he now gets it and will leave him alone or if he will
               over react to this and do something weird. In April they go on
               Choir tour and they stay in hotels and she is nervous if he
               acts weird she will not be comfortable on a trip with him. To
               the point where she is going home because she doesn't want to
               be here because she's afraid he's going to try to contact her
               and do something because its her birthday. Franki called the
               police non-emergency number today (1.17.2014) around 10 talked
               to an officer around 10:43. *****END OF NOTES FROM
               MITCHELL***** I read over the notes and talked with Bordonaro
               about them. I asked her about the claim that her Facebook
               account was hacked. Bordonaro explained that one day Clark was
               in her dorm room with her. She allowed him to use her smart
               phone. Apparently while he was using her phone he accessed
               Bordonaro's unlocked Facebook account and changed her
               relationship status. She found out about it when her
               grandfather commented on it. Bordonaro said the gift bag with
               brownies and cat food were the breaking point for her. I saw
               the pink gift bag with sealed canned cat food and brownies
               inside of it. There was a handwritten tag in which Clark quoted
               an internet published image of Stevie Wonder with the tag line
               "Roses are black, violets are black, everything is black, I
               can't see anything." She is very concerned with Clark waiting
               outside of her classes for her. She has had to change her
               routes to avoid him. Bordonaro began changing the routes she
               took around dead week in December 2013. Clark had found out
               Bordonaro's class schedule by the third day of classes. He was
               waiting for her on Wednesday, January 15, 2014 outside of her
               first floor Honor's classroom. Clark has a class that releases
               at 1300 hours. Bordonaro has a class that begins at that time.
               She said he will wait in the lobby of Honors Hall for an hour
               until she gets out of class. I asked her if she was concerned

               that he may physically hurt or injure her. She said that was
               not a concern but is worried about him following her. I
               provided Bordonaro with a Stalking brochure and the victims
               rights card from Alternatives to Violence of the Palouse
               (ATVP). I educated Bordonaro on her legal options regarding
               stalking and anti harassment orders. I strongly encouraged
               Bordonaro to call and speak with an ATVP advocate. Mitchell did
               the same. We also talked about the possibility of WSU Housing
               trespassing Clark from her residence hall and dining center.
               Mitchell said she will forward the information on to WSU
               Residence Life Administration. Bordonaro has another concern
               that she has two classes with Clark. I told her that can be
               worked through with WSU. She didn't want to change her classes
               at this time. Bordonaro was not sure what actions she wanted to
               take at this time. I encouraged her to call ATVP and speak with
               her family about her options. Bordonaro will be going home to
               Spokane for the long weekend. I told her that I would talk to
               Clark if she wanted. She asked that I communicate to him that
               she no longer wants any contact from him. In addition I stood
               by her Honor Hall classroom before and after her 1300 hour
               class without incident. There is not a valid local address
               listed for Clark in Spillman or Zussis. I called and left a
               message for him on January 18, 2014 at about 1049 hours. The
               case remains under investigation at this time. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               18th day of January, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               went over to the CUB and we were able to locate the phone.

               approximately 1202 hours, I was dispatched to a report of theft
               in the lobby of the WSU Police Department. Upon arrival, I
               contacted Kathlene D. Sampson who told me that she lost her
               phone on 011414 at approximately 1200 hours. The same day, a
               friend of hers received a call from the phone and a male told
               her that he was going to turn the phone into the cougar card
               center because Sampson's cougar card was attached to the phone.
               Sampson told me that on 011614, she received an email from the
               WSU Cougar Card Center advising that her cougar card and phone
               were turned in to their office, and that they took the phone to
               the front desk of the CUB. When she went to the CUB, the desk
               worker was unable to find the phone so she came to report it. I
               walked with her to the CUB front desk and spoke with the
               attendant. He told me that they didn't have the phone. I asked
               for his supervisor and the supervisor was able to locate the
               phone and return it to Sampson. Case unfounded. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On January 17, 2014 at about 1404 hours
               I was dispatched to a theft at Wilmer 201. I responded to the
               building and contacted the complainant/victim, Heather J. Mah
               (01/20/95). Mah told me she received a birthday card in the
               mail from her mother yesterday, January 16, 2014. The card was
               mailed from Olympia, WA. It was sent via United States Postal
               Service. Mah's mother sent a birthday card, Safeway gift card,
               and $60.00 in cash. Mah said the $60.00 in cash was not in the
               envelope when she received it. The cash had been secured with a
               paper clip. The paper clip was still in the envelope. The
               envelope had tape on the back of it where it had been torn. WSU
               Mailing Services put a handwritten note on the back of the
               envelope stating that the envelope was torn when they received
               it. WSU Mailing taped up the envelope prior to delivering it.
               Mah gave me the envelope which I took out to WSU Mailing
               Services and gave it to them. I spoke with Steve Rigby, Mailing
               Services Manager and Joy Rich, Mailing Services Supervisor.
               Rigby was aware of the incident as Mah's mother had contacted
               him. They both told me that the envelope was damaged when they
               received it. WSU Mailing Services personnel did not open or
               look inside the envelope. It is unknown where or when the money
               was taken or lost. It is plausible that the paper clip may have
               caught on the US Postal Services sorting machine and was torn
               in the sorting facility. I told Mah that she could put in a
               claim with the US Postal Service. I provided her with a WSU
               Police case number. There are no suspects, witnesses or leads
               at this time. No further investigation. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               Kaylee M. DeBusk (050494), appeared to be under the age of 21
               and was visibly intoxicated, stumbling side to side as she
               walked. I stopped and contacted DeBusk and the other female,
               later identfied as Akilah C. Henderson (082693), as they
               reached the intersection of Stadium Way and Colorado St. I
               asked if I could talk to them for a minute and they agreed. I
               told them I stopped because I could see DeBusk was intoxicated.
               I asked how much she had to drink and she said she had "a
               little bit of vodka". As I was speaking with DeBusk I noticed
               her speach was slurred. I asked DeBusk if I could check her
               eyes to see how much she had to drink and she agreed. I
               administered a horizontal gaze nystagmus test on DeBusk and
               observed she had bloodshot and watery eyes, a lack of smooth
               pursuit, and a distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum
               deviation in both eyes. I could smell the odor of intoxicants
               on DeBusk's breath as I administered the test. DeBusk agreed to
               provide a breath sample on a PBT. She provided a sample of .234
               on alco sensor FST #5493. I told DeBusk I would be forwarding
               charges to the prosecutor on her for MIP Exhibiting. Henderson
               appeared to be sober and said she was staying with DeBusk for
               the night so DeBusk was allowed to leave with her. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 18 day of January, 2014, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer

               Merman Dr when I observed a group of 4 people, 3 females and 1
               male. I noticed that the male and one of the females was
               helping a second female walk. I parked in the parking lot of
               Terrace Apartments and contacted the group. They advised that
               they had been at an apartment and were walking home to
               Stephenson East. I could smell the odor of alcohol coming from
               the group. I could see that the female who could not walk was
               more intoxicated than the others. She was identified as Raychel
               E. Feller. Feller's eyes were bloodshot and watery, her hair
               was messed up and she could not stand without being supported

               hrs I was driving northbound on Thatuna Rd. approaching Linden
               St. when I noticed a vehicle, WA543WIY, which was traveling in
               the right hand lane of the one way street. The vehicle caught
               my attention because it made a very abrupt left hand turn,
               without signaling, on to Linden St. In making the turn the
               vehicle turned across a lane of travel. I turned in behind the
               vehicle and initiated a traffic stop, turning on my overhead
               lights. The vehicle stopped on Linden St. near Duncan Dunn
               Hall. I contacted the driver, Marina S. Davtyan (030394), and
               told her the reason for the stop and the stop was being
               recorded. As I spoke to Davtyan I could smell the odor of
               intoxicants emitting from the vehicle and noticed Davtyan
               appeared to be under the age of 21. I asked Davtyan for her
               driver's license, vehicle registration, and proof of insurance.
               She said the vehicle did not belong to her but was able to
               locate the proof of insurance. Davtyan groped around in the
               empty back seat briefly before realizing her purse was at her
               friend's dorm room. Davtyan provided me with her name and date
               of birth, which confirmed she was under 21. I asked Davtyan how
               much she had to drink and she initially denied having consumed
               any alcohol. I asked if I could check her eyes to make sure and
               she agreed. I administered a partial HGN with Davtyan seated in
               the vehicle and observed a lack of smooth pursuit and a
               distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation. I asked
               Davtyan to exit the vehicle and move to the nearby sidewalk.
               Davtyan did as requested. I asked Davtyan if she would be
               willing to perform some voluntary field sobriety tests and she
               agreed. The sidewalk where the SFSTs were administered was
               straight with a slight uphill grade. Davtyan was wearing a
               sweater, jeans, and UGG type boots. The approximate temperature
               was 30 degrees. The first test I administered was the
               horizontal gaze nystagmus test. I told Davtyan to stand with
               her feet together and her arms at her sides. I told Davtyan I
               would be evaluating her on all the tests based on how well she
               followed my instructions as well as how she performed on the
               tests. Davtyan said she understood. I told Davtyan to follow
               the tip of my pen with her eyes only and not to move her head.

               Davtyan said she understood. I held my pen approximately 12-15
               inches from Davtyan's face, slightly above eye level. I
               confirmed her pupils were of equal size and her eyes tracked
               equally. I saw Davtyan had bloodshot and watery eyes. I
               observed Davtyan had a lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes, a
               distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation in both
               eyes, and an onset of nystagmus prior to 45 degrees in both
               eyes. The second test I administered was the nine step walk and
               turn. I told Davtyan to imagine a straight line down the middle
               of the sidewalk. I told her to place her left foot on that line
               and then to put her right foot in front of her left, touching
               heel to toe. I told her to keep her arms at her sides and not
               to begin the test until instructed to do so. Davtyan said she
               understood. I told Davtyan when instructed to begin to take
               nine steps, touching heel to toe, down the imaginary straight
               line. I told her to look at her feet the entire time, to count
               each step out loud, and keep her arms at her sides. I told
               Davtyan once she reached her ninth step to leave her front foot
               in place and to take a small series of steps with her back foot
               to turn around. I told Davtyan to take nine more steps back
               down the same imaginary straight line. I reminded Davtyan to
               touch each step heel to toe, keep her arms at her sides, and
               look at her feet the entire time. I told Davtyan it was a
               continuous test and once she began not to stop until she
               completed the test. I demonstrated the test and Davtyan said
               she understood. During her first nine steps Davtyan failed to
               touch heel to toe between any of her steps. She turned
               improperly, only using one step to turn. Davtyan stepped
               offline to her left on step 1/2 and failed to touch heel to toe
               between any of her second nine steps. The third test I
               administered was the one leg stand. I told Davtyan to stand
               with her feet together and her arms at her sides. I told her to
               remain in this position while I explained the test and not to
               start until instructed to do so. Davtyan said she understood. I
               told Davtyan when told to begin to choose one foot, whichever
               she was most comfortable with, and to lift that foot so her toe
               was approximately six inches off the ground. I told her to look
               at her toe the entire time, keep her arms at her sides, and to
               keep both legs straight. I told Davtyan to count out loud by
               1000's (1001, 1002, 1003, and so on) until instructed to stop.
               I told her if at any point in time she put her foot down to
               pick it right back up and continue where she left off. I
               demonstrated the test and Davtyan said she understood. Davtyan
               chose to stand on her left foot, raising her right. Davtyan
               began counting at 1002 and put her foot down immideately. On
               her count of 1006 I had to remind Davtyan to look at her toe.
               She counted to 1019 in 20 seconds. At this time it was my
               opinion that Davtyan was a minor operating a motor vehicle
               after having consumed alcohol. I asked Davtyan if she would
               provide a voluntary sample on a pbt and she refused. I advised
               her she was under arrest for minor operating a motor vehicle
               after having consumed alcohol. I placed her in handcuffs
               (double locked) and advised her of her right to remain silent
               and her right to an attorney. I retrieved Davtyan's cell phone
               from the vehicle at her request. The vehicle was parked in the

               I transported Davtyan to the Pullman PD holding facility for
               the breath test. Upon arrival at the holding facility I checked
               the Datamaster Instrument and found it in proper working order,
               with the RFI antenna attached, the breath tube warm to the
               touch, and the temperature display showing a temperature of
               34.00 degrees. I read Davtyan her Constitutional Rights from
               the DUI packet at 0153 hrs and she signed stating they were
               read to her. She also signed stating she was waiving her
               rights. I read Davtyan her implied consent warning for breath
               at 0156 hrs. Davtyan signed stating it was read to her. I asked
               if she would submit to a breath test and she asked to speak
               with an attorney. I contacted the on call public defender and
               allowed Davtyan to speak with him until I saw her hang up the
               phone. I brought Davtyan back to the Datamaster and asked if
               she wanted me to read her implied consent warnings again and
               she said yes. I began reading the warnings and after reading
               through section 1a Davtyan said she would submit to a breath
               test. I asked if she wanted me to continue reading and she said
               no. I checked Davtyan's mouth at 0208 hrs and found no foreign
               substances. I began to ask Davtyan the questions from the DUI
               packet and she said she did not wish to answer any questions. I
               waited for the 15 minute observation period to pass. Davtyan
               provided a breath sample of .145 at 0227 hrs and a second
               sample of .139 at 0230 hrs. The test was administered in
               accordance with the methods approved by the Washington State
               Toxicologist pursuant to the Washington Administrative Code. I
               provided Davtyan with her copy of the driver's hearing reqeust
               and breath test document. I placed Davtyan in a holding cell. I
               completed criminal citation 14-W0176 for Davtyan for DUI. I
               later returned to the holding facility and read Davtyan her
               notice of hearing/conditions of release form. As I was reading
               the form she interrupted and said she would not be here. I
               finished reading the form and asked if she was going to appear
               for court. She thought for a moment before saying no, that she
               had to go home and she had class. I told Davtyan to return to
               the holding cell. She asked why and I told her I would be
               booking her into jail to make sure she appeared for court.
               Davtyan tried to say she would sign the form at that point but
               I told her it was too late. Davtyan was placed back in a
               holding cell while I completed a PC booking form and voided the
               citation. As I was completing the booking sheet I noticed the
               spelling of her first name she gave me was Marina but the
               spelling on her driver's return was Marine. I went to PPD as
               Officer Jones was preparing to transport her and she said the
               spelling on her driver's license is wrong. I will be entering
               the alternate spelling as an alias and leaving the Datamaster
               paperwork as the spelling on her driver's return. She was later
               transported to the Whitman County Jail for booking. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 18 day of January, 2014, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 01-18-14 I was dispatched to an
               unconscious person in the Northside Hall #420. I responded
               there and contacted three males. Two identified themselves as
               hall staff and the other said he was a student, but lived on
               Duncan Lane. Hall staff told me they had found him sleeping in
               the study lounge, but he doesn't live there. I could tell the
               male had been drinking, but was not intoxicated. I asked the
               male where he lived at and he said Duncan Lane. I asked him how
               he got in the hall and he said he didn't know. He just woke up
               here. The male seemed to be fine just a little tired. I asked
               him if he knew how to get home and he said he did. Pullman Fire
               arrived on scene and evaluated him. They determined he was fine
               to be on his own. Due to the high call volume I didn't identify
               any of the three males. As soon as Pullman Fired arrived I
               cleared the scene. Nothing

               SYNOPSIS: Carolina M. Ramirez was driving her 2005 Pontiac
               Grand Am whe she struck a vehicle in the Stephenson Key. She
               did not stop and leave her information. There was noticeable
               damage to the other vehicle. Ramirez was identified as the
               driver of the vehicle and the witness' stated that Ramirez was
               intoxicated at the time of the collision. She was found and
               arrested for Hit and Run and DUI. DRIVER 1: Carolina M. Ramirez

               Mendoza Nic Smith NARRATIVE: On 01-18-14 I was at the
               Stephenson Complex for an unrelated incident when I was
               contacted by a Anita Mendoza. She told me that her friend a
               Carolina Ramirez and just struck a parked vehicle and drove
               away. She told me that the two were at a party and Ramirez had
               been drinking heavily. Mendoza was the designated driver and
               they had driven to the party and back in Ramirez's 2005 Pontiac
               Grand Am. The two came back to Ramirez's Stephenson North room
               and were hanging out. When Ramirez noticed her cell phone was
               missing she grabbed her car keys and said she was going back to
               the party and get her phone. The two struggled over the keys,
               but Ramirez overpowered Mendoza. Mendoza followed Ramirez to
               the vehicle, but couldn't stop her from leaving. Mendoza said
               that Ramirez started the Pontiac, put the vehicle in reverse
               and started pulling out of the parking spot. She turned the
               front wheels and struck the Corolla. I asked how she knew the
               other vehicle was struck. She said there was damage to the
               Corolla and she could see the car move back and forth when it
               was struck. Mendoza said that the last time she saw Ramirez was
               when she was leaving the parking lot. I asked her for the
               vehicle description. She said it was a gold or silver Pontiac
               with Washington Plates. I asked Mendoza if she was hurt during
               the struggle and she said "No I am just worried about Ramirez."
               I told her that if Ramirez returned to call 911. I had WHITCOM
               run the Corrola's plate and it came back to a Olga Kuzmich.
               There is no person matching that name in the WSU directory and
               no one in DAPS matching either. I left my business card on the
               window and cleared the scene. I had WHITCOM send out an ATL on
               the Grand Am and Ramirez. I began looking in all the parking
               lots in the area but had no success. I went to several other
               calls then decided to return to the scene. In the parking lot I

               found the vehicle a 2005 Pontiac Grand Am. WA/Lic AMX1886. I
               looked at the vehicle and saw there was fresh damage to the
               drivers side front fender. There was also blue paint transfer
               to that same fender. The hood was still warm. I photographed
               the vehicle then went to the 5th floor to look for Ramirez.
               Ramirez's room as #523. I knocked on the door several times
               before a Adriana Flores answered the door. I asked to speak to
               Ramirez. Flores woke up Ramirez and told her I needed to speak
               with her. She got out of bed and came to the door. I told her I
               was there was because of the hit and run. I told her I needed
               to get the vehicle information so I could give it to the other
               owner. She got a coat and the keys to the vehicle. We walked to
               where the vehicle was parked. I showed her the damage and asked
               her for the vehicle registration and proof of insurance. She
               open the vehicle and retrieved the items. I told Ramirez that
               id would like to ask her some questions but I need to read her
               constitutional right. I read them to her off of my card and
               asked her if she understood her rights. She said she did. I
               asked if she would like to speak to me still and she said she
               would. I told her that I knew she and Mendoz had went to a
               party and that she had been drinking. Mendoza was the
               designated driver and drove the two back from the party. That
               shortly after the two got to Ramirez's room she had realized
               her phone was missing. She had gotten the keys from Mendoza by
               overpowering her. She went to her car started it and when she
               was leaving the parking spot she struck the Corolla. I told her
               that there was two other witness' to the incident. I asked her
               if she had anything to say about what I had just said. She
               didn't respond. I asked her if she had bee drinking tonight and
               she said she had. I asked if she took the keys from Mendoza and
               she said she had. I asked if she drove the Grand Am striking
               the Corolla then leaving the scene. She admitted to doing
               everything I told her. While she spoke there was a strong odor
               of intoxicating beverages coming from her breath. I asked her
               if she would be willing to perform some field sobriety tested
               and she said she would. I had her stand on the sidewalk near
               the stairs to Stephenson North's doors. I asked he if she had
               any physical limitations that might prevent her from performing
               the tests properly. She said there was nothing. I asked her if
               she read and wrote the English language and she said she did. I
               asked her if she wore contacts and she said she didn't. Ramirez
               was wearing a winter coat, slippers, and stretch pants. The
               temperature at the time of the test was 25 degrees F. The first
               test I administered was the horizontal gaze nystagmus test. I
               told Ramirez to stand with her feet together and her arms at
               her sides. I told him to follow the tip of my finger with her
               eyes only and not to move her head. Ramirez said she
               understood. I confirmed her pupils were of equal size and her
               eyes tracked equally. I observed Ramirez had watery eyes. I saw
               a lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes, a distinct and sustained
               nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes, and an immediate
               onset of nystagmus in both eyes. Ramirez swayed in a circular
               motion during the test. The second test I administered was the
               nine step walk and turn. I told Ramirez to imagine a straight
               line down the middle of the sidewalk. I told her to place her

               left foot on the line and then to place his right foot in front
               of her left touching heel to toe. I told her to remain in this
               position while I explained the rest of the test and not to
               begin until instructed to do so. Ramirez said she understood. I
               told Ramirez to take nine steps, touching heel to toe, down the
               imaginary straight line. I told him to look at his feet the
               entire time and to keep her arms at her sides. I told Ramirez
               to count each step out loud. I told Ramirez once she reached
               his ninth step to leave her front foot in place and to take a
               series of small steps with her back foot to turn around. I told
               Ramirez to take nine more steps back down the same imaginary
               straight line. I demonstrated the test and Ramirez said she
               understood. Ramirez swayed from left to right and front to back
               in the starting position, stepping out of the starting position
               several times and swaying side to side with her arms out to
               maintain balance. During her first nine steps Ramirez used her
               arms for balance through most of the test. She stepped offline
               to her right on step 3/4/6 steps. Ramirez turned improperly,
               moving both feet. During her second nine steps Ramirez
               continued to use her arms for balance. She stepped offline to
               his left on step 3/4/and 7. She never touched heel to toe
               during the whole test. The steps were approximately 2 inches
               apart. Ramirez took 10 steps in her second 9 steps. The third
               test I administered was the one leg stand. I told Ramirez to
               stand with her feet together and her arms at her sides. I told
               her to remain in this position while I explained the test and
               not to begin until instructed to do so. Ramirez said she
               understood. I told Ramirez to pick one foot, whichever she
               chose. I told her to lift that foot so her toe was
               approximately six inches off the ground. I told her to point
               her foot so to bottom of his foot was parallel with the ground
               and to keep both legs straight. I told her to look at her toe
               and to keep her arms at her sides. I told Ramirez to count out
               loud by 1000's (1001, 1002, 1003, and so on) until instructed
               to stop. I told her if at any point in time she put her foot
               down to pick it right back up and continue where she left off.
               I demonstrated the test and Ramirez said she understood my
               instructions. Ramirez chose to stand on her right foot, raising
               her left. Ramirez used her arms for balance throughout the
               test. Ramirez only held her foot approximately 3 inches off the
               ground. Ramirez counted to 1020 in 30 seconds. At this time it
               was my opinion that Ramirez ability to drive was impaired by
               alcohol. I asked if she was willing to provide a voluntary
               breath sample on a PBT and she said she would and gave a sample
               of .08. I advised Ramirez she was under arrest for DUI and
               placed her in handcuffs (double locked). I advised Ramirez of
               her right to remain silent and her right to an attorney. I
               placed Ramirez in the back of my patrol car and then
               transported her to PPD's holding facility. I read Ramirez her
               Constitutional Rights from the DUI packet at 0423 hrs and she
               signed stating it was read to her. I checked Ramirez's mouth at
               0425 hrs and found no foreign substances. I read Ramirez her
               implied consent warning for breath at 0431 hrs. Ramirez signed
               the DUI packet stating it was read to her. I asked if she would

               box on the DUI packet. I asked Ramirez the questions from the
               DUI packet. She told me she thought the belts on her vehicle
               were worn out. She admitted to having consumed 2 coors 12 oz.
               beers between 2200 hrs and 2330 hrs. Ramirez thought it was
               0430 hrs when it was actually 0442 hrs. I waited for the
               remainder of the observation period to pass. I checked the
               Datamaster Instrument and found it in proper working order,
               with the RFI antenna attached, the breath tube warm to the
               touch, and the temperature display showing 34.00 degrees.
               Ramirez provided a sample of .066 at 0453 hrs and a second
               sample of .066 at 0456 hrs. The test was administered in
               accordance with the methods approved by the Washington State
               Toxicologist pursuant to the Washington Administrative Code. I
               provided her with a copy of the driver's hearing request/fee
               waiver form. I also provided her with a copy of the breath test
               document. I placed Ramirez in a holding cell while I completed
               paperwork. Ramirez was later transported back to her Stephenson
               North Room where she was issued a copy of her citation and
               notice to appear. I told her to expect a call from the other
               vehicles owner about the damage caused to their vehicle. She
               said she understood and she entered the building. I have yet to
               find the owner of the other vehicle involved. Nothing further
               at this time................ I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 01-18-14 at approximately 0240 hours
               I was dispatched to an unconscious male outside of Streit Hall.
               Upon my arrival I contacted two males at the Southeast
               stairwell entrance. On male, later identified as Luke A.
               Lattanzio, was leaning up against the wall and the other a R/A
               Matt Olsen was standing next to him. The male was clearly under
               21 years of age. I asked Luke what was going on and he said
               something neither I or Olsen could understand. Eventhough he
               was leaning on the wall he was swaying back and forth. I asked
               him if he would be willing to sit on the stairs and he said
               "OK." Whe he went to move he almost fell. I grabbed him by his
               left arm and assisted him into a sitting position. I asked
               Olsen what had happen. He said he found Luke passed out on the
               ground near the door. Scared for Luke's safety he called 911.
               The tempurature outside at the time of the call was 25 degrees
               F. I asked him for his identification and he said he didn't
               have it. I could see a bulge in his left rear pocket. I asked
               him if the bulge was his wallet and he said it was. I asked him
               if I could see it and he began trying to pull it out. It took
               him several tried but he finally succedded. While waiting for
               Medics to arrive I asked him several simple questions. He
               couldn't answer who the President of the United States. Knew he
               was in Pullman Washington, but when asked where he lived at he
               didn't know. When he spoke there was a very strong odor of
               intoxicating beverages coming from his breath. I asked how much
               he had drank and he said "Way too much." I asked Luke if he
               would be willing to provide a sample of his breath and he said
               he would. With a very small breath the reading was .187. Medics
               arrived on scene and it was determined that he was a candidate
               for Detox. Since Pullman Fire was going call to call and they
               would have to call for an AOA from Colfax Ambulance if they
               transported Luke to PRH, I told the medics I would transport
               him to the hospital. I told Luke he was being taken into
               protective custody and would be transported to PRH to be
               Detoxed. I placed him in the rear of my patrol car and
               transported him to PRH. There I escorted Luke inside, told the
               nurse what was going on. I filled out a protective custody

               01/18/14 I was driving eastbound on Colorado St. when I noticed
               the vehicle in front of me had expired license tabs. I ran the
               vehicle registration on my MDC which confirmed the license was
               expired as of 12/27/13. I initiated a traffic stop on the
               vehicle, turning on my overhead lights. The vehicle stopped on
               Colorado St. near Streit Hall. I contacted the driver,
               Nicholaus I. Perry (013087). I told him the reson for the stop
               and the stop was being recorded. I asked Perry for his driver's
               license, vehicle registration, and proof of insurance. Perry
               was only able to provide his driver's license. I ran Perry's
               driver's license, which returned as being DWLS 3rd degree. I
               returned to the vehicle and asked Perry if he had unpaid
               tickets and he said he probably did. I advised him his driver's
               license was suspended and had him exit the vehicle. I had him
               sit on the front of his vehicle and begin calling someone to
               come drive the vehicle for him. I issued Perry criminal
               citation #4Z0196220 for DWLS 3rd degree. I explained the
               citation to him, he received his copy, and was released. Perry
               was unable to find anyone to come get his car so I moved it to
               Flag Ln. for him for the evening. Nothing further. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.
