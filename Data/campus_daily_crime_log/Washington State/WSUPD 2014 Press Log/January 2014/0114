               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W0114 OWNER 1: Robert J. Taylor (110993)
               VEHICLE 1: 2005 Jeep Grand Cherokee WA/AIJ6717 PASSENGER (S):
               None INSURANCE: Liberty Mutual PEDESTRIAN: Laurel D. Aldrich
               (080862) INSURANCE: SYNOPSIS: Injury traffic collision
               involving a pedestrian. Laurel D. Aldrich was transported to
               PRH for injuries to her head and hip. Taylor was issued an
               infraction for failing to yield to a pedestrian in a crosswalk.
               Investigation continues. NARRATIVE: On 011414 at approximately
               1206 hours, I was dispatched to a vehicle versus a pedestrian
               traffic collision on Spokane Street at College Avenue. Upon
               arrival, I found Laurel D. Aldrich (080862) laying in the
               middle of the intersection with a lasceration to her head and
               complaining of hip pain. Witness, Eric C. Brown, told me he was
               an EMT and was stabalizing her head. Until medics arrived and
               took over care for Aldrich. Aldrich was transported to PRH for
               medical treatment. Sgt. Macy and I contacted the driver of a
               2005 Jeep Grand Cherokee who identified himself as Robert J.
               Taylor with his WADL. Taylor told me that he was driving SB on
               SE Spokane Street, and that he wasn't going faster than 30 MPH.
               HE estimated his speed to be more around 25 MPH. He told me
               that as he was driving, he didn't see Aldrich until
               approximately 10 feet in front of the green pickup that was
               parked along Spokane Street. Sgt. Macy measured the green
               pickup at 33 feet from the crosswalk. He stated that he slammed
               on the brakes when he saw Aldrich but he wasn't able to stop in
               time. Because Taylor had already moved his car, Sgt. Macy asked
               him to estimate where his vehicle came to a stop. Taylor showed
               Sgt. Macy where he thought his vehicle came to a stop which
               measured eight (8) feet past the crosswalk. Sgt. Macy checked
               the damage to Taylor's vehicle and indicated there the front
               grill next to the passenger side headlight was cracked and
               there was a dent in the hood of his car. Sgt. Macy took
               pictures of the damage to Taylor's car and estimated the damage
               at approximately $1200.00. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 14th day of January,
               2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               dispatched to a request for information about fraud protection.
               I contacted the complainant, Sharon M. Howard (DOB 03-16-1978),
               on the telephone. Howard explained that last year a hard drive
               was stolen from an office in Abelson Hall. For more
               information, see case #13-W4492. The hard drive contained
               personal information for many WSU students and staff members.
               Howard told me that her name and social security number were on
               the stolen hard drive. Howard has been concerned that someone
               might try to use her personal information unlawfully and found
               out that she could sign up for credit protection services
               through the three large credit bureaus. Howard explained that
               in order to register for this service, she needed a police case
               number. I provided assistance and gave Howard the case number.
               No further action at this time. Olmstead/339 I certify and

               on Colorado St. when I noticed a male walking eastbound on the
               northside side walk of Colorado St. The male was having a lot
               of difficulty walking. The male, later identified as Maxwell
               Hammond Cordell 11/18/94, was stumbling side to side taking up
               the whole width of the sidewalk. At one point Cordell stumbled
               into the iron fence he was walking next to. When I passed
               Cordell he appeared to be under the age of 21. I turned around
               and parked my patrol car. I exited the car and saw Cordell
               running towards me. When Cordell reached me, I asked him if he
               had a second to talk. Cordell stopped and I asked him where he
               was headed and he said his dorm. Cordell was standing very
               close to me and I could clearly smell the very strong odor of
               intoxicants coming from his breath. I explained the reason why
               I was contacting Cordell to him. Cordell said he was trying to
               get home in a hurry. I asked Cordell how old he was and he
               stated, "19." Cordell provided his information verbally because
               he only had his WSU Cougar Card with him. I asked Cordell if I
               could check his eyes and he said I could. I performed an HGN
               test on Cordell. During the test I observed equal tracking,
               equal pupil size, lack of smooth pursuit, and distinct and
               sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation. Cordell's eyes were
               bloodshot and watery. Cordell was swaying side to side while he
               performed the test. I asked Cordell how much he had to drink
               tonight. Cordell said he had "a little bit." I asked how much
               that was and Cordell said, "4 to 5 beers." I asked Cordell if
               he would provide a PBT sample. While explaining the PBT,
               Cordell interrupted me and asked, "is there any any
               incriminating evidence involving this event." I told Cordell
               that he was under the age of 21, he was in public, and he had
               consumed alcohol. I told Cordell that describes the crime of
               MIP. I again asked Cordell if he would provide a PBT sample and
               asked several times what would happen if he did not provide a
               sample. I told Cordell that nothing different would happen
               whether he provided a sample or not. Cordell asked if he was
               free to go and I told him no, that he was under arrest for MIP,
               and handcuffed (D/L) him. I advised Cordell of his right to

               counsel and Intern Whitney searched Cordell at my direction. No
               weapons or illegal items were found during the search. Cordell
               was placed in the backseat of my patrol car and I transported
               him to Pullman Holding Facility. Once at the holding facility,
               Cordell was fingerprinted and photographed. I asked Cordell if
               he was willing to provide a PBT sample so I could know how high
               on a BAC scale he was for determining when I could release him.
               Cordell said that was fine. I found my PBT (Alco-Sensor FST
               #16805) in working condition. Cordell provided a PBT sample of
               .205. I asked Cordell if he had a roommate that could watch him
               tonight. Cordell said he lives alone in his dorm room. I asked
               if there was anybody else who was sober that could watch him.
               Cordell said he could think of two people. I called one person
               but he was unable to come get Cordell. The second person
               Cordell did not have the phone number. Due to Cordell's very
               high intoxication level, I left Cordell at the holding facility
               to sober up. At approximately 0500 hours, I returned to the
               holding facility to release Cordell. I explained to Cordell
               that I would be forwarding charges of MIP Exhibiting to the
               prosecutor. I also told Cordell that I would be referring my
               case to student conduct. Cordell stated he understood. I
               offered Cordell a ride back to his dorm but he said he wanted
               to walk. Cordell was released from custody at 0512 hours.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 15th day of January, 2014, in

               unconscious person in the Stimson Hall parking lot. The R/P
               stated that there was a male subject, later identified as
               Alexis Cortez, sitting in his vehicle, the engine was running,
               and the radio was turned on loudly. The R/P tried to wake
