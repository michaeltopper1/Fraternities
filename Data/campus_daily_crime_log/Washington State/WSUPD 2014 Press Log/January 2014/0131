               01/31/14 at approximately 0800 hours I was dispatched to a
               collision that occurred on 01/30/14. I called the reporting
               party, Roy Fye, and asked him what happened. Fye explained to
               me that on 01/30/14 at approximately 1200 hours he was
               traveling north on Stadium Way at Vogel Hall. Fye said there
               was a Pullman Transit bus stopped at the bus stop at Vogel
               Hall. Fye said the passenger side mirror on his truck hit the
               bus and folded in. Fye said at the time of the collision,
               Stadium Way was closed to one lane of travel in each direction
               (both northbound lanes were used for north and south bound
               travel) due to construction at Martin Stadium. Fye said he
               checked his mirror and noticed it just folded in and there was
               no damage to it. I called Chris at Pullman Transit and asked
               him to check his busses for damage that would have been stopped
               at Vogel around 1200 hours on 01/30/14. Chris said he would and
               call me back. I sent Fye an email with links to the policy
               manual regarding collisions as well as a collision reporting
               form in case it is needed. Investigation continues. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.

               NARRATIVE: On 01/31/14 at approximately 1430 hours I was
               dispatched to the Blue Lot for a fraudulent parking permit. I
               responded and found parking services at a vehicle. I noticed
               the vehicle had a wheel lock attached to the driver's side
               front tire and a notice on the windshield. I noticed a parking
               permit hanging on the rear view mirror. The permit was clearly
               fraudulent. I saw the paper curled away from the plastic and it
               did not appear laminated. I could see BL1 on the left side of
               the permit, but it did not appear to have other numbers,
               although it was covered by a pine tree forest (copious amounts
               of air fresheners). I took a photo of the permit. I called
               Aaron Colyer at parking services and told him to let me know if
               the subject does not come in and take care of the tickets. On
               02/01/14 at approximately 1300 hours I met Rivera at her
               vehicle. Rivera opened the door and the fraudulent pass was
               still on the visor. Rivera said she did not know how the permit
               got there because she has a valid permit. I asked Rivera if she
               loaned it to anyone and she said no. Rivera said someone must
               have got into her vehicle. I told Rivera to discard the
               ficticious permit and she tore it up. I noticed the permit was
               a piece of photocopied paper on packing tape. I told Rivera to
               deal with parking services on Monday about the fines and warned
               her that it was a felony to forge a permit. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 1st day of February, 2014, in Pullman,

               31, 2014 at about 1520 hours I received a telephone call from
               Randall Pinter, WSU Police Department. He told me that he had
               just answered a telephone call made to the main business number
               335-8548 at WSU Police Department. A woman who identified
               herself as Diane DecourcyPickford (05/03/55) was the caller.
               She told Pinter that she knew who he was and that she had been
               raped. When Pinter tried to transfer the call she hung up. I
               called DecourcyPickford at about 1522 hours. She told me she
               had called because she needed to put one foot forward. I asked
               her if she needed help, if she needed a police officer to
               respond to her house. She said that was not necessary. I asked
               her if she had been raped. DecourcyPickford said "I was raped a
               long time ago in my home. The guy who did it is dead." When
               further questioned she said she didn't want it to happed to
               anyone else and the guy died a long time ago as well. Nothing
               has happened recently. I again asked her if she wanted any
               help. She said "no." DecourcyPickford has a history of calling
               the police and she suffers from mental illness. She lives in
               Pullman Police jurisdiction. No further investigation. I

               hrs I was driving eastbound on Colorado St. passing the lower
               soccer field when I noticed a male, later identified as Jared
               D. Crain (122794), who was in the Scott/Coman parking lot.
               Crain caught my attention because he was bent over as if he had
               been, or was about to start, vomiting. I turned into the
               parking lot to contact Crain and as he saw me do so he stood up
               and began walking toward Colorado St. I noticed Crain appeared
               to be under the age of 21 and was stumbling as he walked. I
               contacted Crain and asked if he had been, or felt like he
               might, vomit. He said no. I asked how much he had to drink and
               he admitted to having had a couple drinks. As I spoke to Crain
               I could smell the odor of intoxicants on his breath. I asked if
               I could check his eyes and he agreed. I administered a
               horizontal gaze nystagmus test on him. I observed he had
               bloodshot and water eyes, a lack of smooth pursuit, and a
               distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation. I asked
               Crain for his drivers license, which he provided. His drivers
               license confirmed he was under the age of 21. I told Crain I
               would be forwarding charges to the prosecutor for MIP
               exhibiting. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 01 day of

               at about 0031 hrs I was driving westbound on Colorado St. when
               I noticed a female, later identified as Rachel V. Herz
               (112294), who was walking eastbound on Colorado St. passing WSU
               parking services. Herz caught my attention because she appeared
               to be under the age of 21 and was having difficutly walking,
               stumbling side to side. I turned around and contacted Herz as
               she was entering the Scott Coman parking lot. I asked Herz
               where she was going and she said home, to Regents Hall. I asked
               how much she had to drink and she said she didn't know. She
               wasn't able to tell me what she had been drinking either. As I
               spoke to Herz I could smell the odor of intoxicants on her
               breath and noticed she spoke with slurred speech. I asked Herz
               how old she was and she said 19. She did not have her ID with
               her but provided her name and date of birth, which I confirmed
               through dispatch. I asked Herz if I could check her eyes and
               she consented. I administered a horizontal gaze nystagmus test
               on her and observed she had bloodshot and watery eyes, a lack
               of smooth pursuit, a distinct and sustained nystagmus at
               maximum deviation, and an immideate onset of nystagmus. I
               attempted to have Herz provide a breath sample on a PBT but she
               was unable to provide an adequate sample. I contacted Herz'
               roommate on the phone, who initially said she would come get
               Herz. As we were waiting I explained to Herz I would be
               forwarding charges for MIP Exhibiting to the Whitman County
               Prosecutor. After waiting for some time I attempted to contact
               Herz' roommate again but was unable to do so as she was no
               longer answering her phone. I walked Herz to her room, room 483
               Regents Hall. Nothing further. I certify and declare under

               hours WSU units and Pullman Paramedics were dispatched to the
               report of an overdose at Scott Hall in the 2nd floor bathroom.
               Sgt. Jacobson and I respnonded. I contacted Kathleen A. Newsom
               on the floor of a bathroom stall. She had her head laying on
               the toilet bowl which was filled with vomit. I asked Newsom
               several questions, most of which she could answer. Newsom did
               not know how much she drank or where she had been drinking.
               Paramedics evaluated Newsom and determined she did not need to
               go to the hospital. This is the second time Newsom has been
               contacted for an alcohol violation. Student conduct only. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 1st day of February, 2014, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Corporal
