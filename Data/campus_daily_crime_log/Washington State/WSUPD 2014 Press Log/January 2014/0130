               01/30/14 at approximately 0930 hours Intern Smith and I were
               parked on NE Garden Ave. near NE Merman Dr. monitoring traffic.
               I saw the defendant's vehicle traveling south on Merman Dr. at
               our location. I noticed the passenger was leaning forward and
               was not wearing his seatbelt. The passenger was wearing a light
               blue sweatshirt and I did not see the belt across his chest and
               could see the belt along the seat. I stopped the vehicle on NE
               Valley Rd. and activated my VieVu camera. I contacted the
               passenger, who admitted he was not wearing his seatbelt. I
               asked the passenger for his license, which he provided,
               identifying him as Jason P. Virgl 02/16/94. I could smell the
               odor of fresh marijuana emitting from the vehicle. I asked
               Virgl how old he was and he said 19. I asked the driver how old
               he was and he said 20. I asked the driver for his ID, which he
               provided, identifying him as Brian T. Blowe 08/24/93. I told
               the two I could smell the odor of marijuana coming from the
               vehicle. I asked if either were over 21 and they said no. I
               asked if either had a medical marijuana card and they said no.
               I asked how much marijuana was in the car and Virgl said just a
               little. Virgl retrieved a bag with a small amount of what I
               recognized to be marijuana in it and handed it to me. I asked
               if there were any smoking devices in the car and they said no.
               I asked Blowe if he had any marijuana and he said he did not
               even know that Virgl did. I returned to my vehicle and ran the
               subject's information and both returned clear and current. I
               returned to the vehicle and explained to Virgl that I would be
               forwarding charges to the prosecutor's office. I told Virgl the
               prosecutor's office would get in touch with him through the
               mail. I cleared the stop and returned to WSUPD where I tested
               the marijuana with a NIK test kit. The test showed a
               presumptive positive result for Cannabis Sativa. I photographed
               the test kit and saved the photos to the case. I logged the
               marijuana into evidence and downloaded my video. Charges
               forwarded. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 30th day of January, 2014, in Pullman,

               NARRATIVE: On 01/30/14 at about 2122 hrs Dispatch advised of a
               Missing Person's call. I contacted the complainant, Randal W.
               Kraght (090959), who told me he was concerned about the
               welbeing of his son, Jacob R. Kraght (050393). Jacob is a WSU
               student and has been involved in some very difficult
               circumstances in the prior week. He was involved in a fatality
               colision on 01/24/14 and his girlfriend has "dumped" him since
               then. Randal said his other son's girlfriend spoke to Jacob on
               the phone at about 0215 hrs. At that time Jacob was expressing
               suicidal thoughts, saying he "can't face anybody", "can't
               handle it any more", and "just wants to call it quits and end
               it". Jacob had thrown away his phone prior to this phone call
               and had not been in contact with his family. They were able to
               determine the call he made was from a pay phone outside the
               Portland airport. They contacted the Port of Portland Police,
               who advised they needed a missing persons report filed to
               release any information. I contacted the Port of Portland
               Police Department and they were able to release the information
               to me they could not tell the parents. They advised Jacob was
               on Alaska Airlines flight 863 to Maui, which was scheduled to
               land at 1023 pm pacific time. I contacted the Maui police
               department and forwarded the information I had regarding Jacob
               and his possibly suicidal thoughts. They advised they would
               contact Jacob as he exited the plane. I provided Maui PD with
               Randal's contact information. I advised Randal Jacob was on a
               flight to Maui but I could not tell him which one. I told him
               Maui police would be contacting Jacob when he landed. At about
               0115 hrs on 01/31/14 I received a call from the Maui Police
               Department advising Jacob was transported to the hospital to be
               seen by a mental health professional, who would determine if
               Jacob needed to be held for further treatment/evaluation. Maui
               PD had already advised Randal of the contact with Jacob. I
               attempted to contact Randal to make sure he got the information
               but received no answer. I left a message advising him of
               Jacob's situation and told him WSU PD has Jacob's computer
               which was turned in as found property on 01/24/14 (14-W0276).
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury

               NARRATIVE: On 01-30-14 at about 2256 hours I was dispatched to
               the report of a welfare check. The RP, Maria M. Martija-Harris,
               was requesting a welfare check on her son who she said recently
               lost his job and has a history of depression. Maria advised
               that she had not talked to her son since 4pm today and was
               worried about him. Her son was identified as Marco V. Maritja-
               Harris. I found a local address for Marco at Northside
               Residence room 564. Officer Boyd and I went to Northside and
               knocked on the door to 564. A male answered who identified
               himself as Marco's roommate. He said Marco was in the lounge
               studying and showed us to him. I saw that Marco was on his
               computer studying with a female. Marco came into the hallway to
               talk to me. He seemed happy and upbeat. I asked Marco if he was
               ok and he said yes, he was just studying. I told him that his
               mom had been trying to call him. He looked at his phone and
               told me that he had put the phone on silent so he could study.
               While I was standing there he dialed his mother. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under

               01/30/14 I was advised that a subject, Joel Villela, was seen
               on Campus. Viella is trespassed from all WSU campuses. I
               checked Villela's facebook page and noticed he shows his place
               of employment at Beasley. I called Beasley and spoke with
               Russell D. Driver, Assistant Director, and asked about
               Villela's employment status. Driver said Villela is currently
               employed there and has been working several times this month. I
               responded to Beasley and spoke with Driver. Driver provided me
               with a a copy of Villela's time card. The time card has the
               name Villela, Alex at the top of it. Villela's middle name is
               Alejandro and he goes by "Alex". The time card shows Villela
               working on the following dates in January; 12th, 16th, 19th,
               24th, 26th, 27th, 28th, and 29th. Driver said Villela is
               schedule to work at 2100 hours on 01/31/14. I asked Driver if
               he knows Villela and he said he did. Driver said that he saw
               Villela working on 01/28/14 around 1530 hours. I asked Driver
               where he saw Villela and he said he saw him in the tunnel at
               Beasley and also made a delivery with him. Driver said Villela
               was in the passenger seat of the truck he was driving. I showed
               Driver Villela's photo on facebook and asked Driver if that was
               the subject he was with and he said it was. I explained to
               Driver that Villela was trespassed from Campus. Driver said he
               was not aware of that. I explained to Driver that I would have
               an officer respond to Beasley around 2100 hours on 01/31/14 to
               contact Villela. I got a call from Driver later on in the day
               and he said he noticed that Villela is scheduled to work at
               1300 hours on 01/31/14 to make a delivery. Driver said he did
               not have another subject at this time to make the delivery. I
               told Driver to keep Villela scheduled as I continued my
               investigation. I called Denis Tracy, Whitman County Prosecutor,
               and told him of the situation. Tracy asked that I gather all of
               the documents pertaining to the trespass order and service and
               provide him with it on 01/31/14. I contacted Adam Jussel,
               Director of Student Standards and Accountability. I asked
               Jussel to tell me about any paper work they served on Villela
               trespassing him from campus. Jussel said a letter from his
               officer was sent to Villela via email and to his home address
               in Quincy. Jussel said the letter was also sent to the Whitman

               County Jail. I found that Ofc. Jones faxed a copy of this
               letter to the jail. The letter advised Villela that he had been
               expelled from school and was trespassed from Washington State
               University. The letter allowed for an appeal as long as it was
               done within 21 days. The appeal had to be in writing. On
               11/01/13 Jussel sent a letter (mail and email) to Villela
               advising him the he was aware he was attempting to appeal the
               process, and advised him of the steps required. This letter was
               also sent to the jail on 11/04/13 to be served on Villela. On
               11/21/13 the appeals board sent a letter (mail and email) to
               Villela advising him that his request for an appeal was
               received on 11/15/13. The appeals board stated the appeal was
               received past the 21 days allotted, therefore the conduct
               boards decision stands. I found a copy of a Trespass Admonition
               signed by Asst. Chief Hansen. The letter is dated 12/03/13. It
               is noted that the letter was sent certified mail to Villela's
               home address in Quincy. The letter was signed received by a
               Teresa V. on 12/12/13. I attached a copy of this admonition to
               the case. The admonition trespasses Villela from Washington
               State University including all branch and urban campuses.
               Investigation continues. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this ____ day of
