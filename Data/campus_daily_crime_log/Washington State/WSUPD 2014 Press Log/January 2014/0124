               24, 2014 at about 1245 hours I was dispatched to the WSU Police
               Department lobby for a report of found property. I contacted
               the complainant, Robert T. Bondurant (01/19/76). He handed me
               an Apple MacBook Pro computer that he found on SR 27 near the
               intersection of Clear Creek Rd. The laptop has a dent on the
               side of it. The cover has two large stickers that read "Lions"
               and the other is "I'm Kraghty." The laptop is still functional.
               The user name "Jake Kraght" appears on the login page. The
               serial number is C02FD2FLDF8V. Bondurant found it while driving
               south on SR 27 to Pullman. He turned it into the WSU Police
               Department because he thought a student owned it. I found the
               name Jacob R. Kraght in Spillman and in Zussis. I called his
               phone number twice. Unfortunately the voicemail box is full and
               I could not leave a message. His address according to Zussis is
               a PO Box in Palouse. The item was placed into a temporary
               evidence locker as found property. I will make attempts to
               contact Kraght over the next few days to pick up his property.
               I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws
               of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 24th day of January, 2014, in Pullman,

               WSU STUDENT: XX YES NO OTHER UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 012414
               at approximately 1230 hours, I was looking throught the active
               Whitman County Warrant list that was emailed to me by the
               Whitman County Court Clerk on 011514. I came across Louis A.
               Harris' name in the list and checked his WSU student status and
               noticed he is a current student at WSU. I asked Whitcom to run
               a warrant check for Harris and was advised that he had an
               active, extraditable warrant out of Adams County, Washington. I
               pulled Harris' schedule and noticed he had a class at 1300
               hours. I printed an old jail booking photo for him and
               responded to the area of his class. At approximately 1308
               hours, I saw Harris walking toward the entrance to his class.
               He looked at me and I asked him if he is Louis. He stared at me
               and asked me why I wanted to know. I asked him if he knew why I
               was at his class and he told me he thought so and asked if we
               could walk around the corner so his classmates wouldn't see him
               getting arrested. I told him we could. I walked to another area
               of the builing and he asked if he could make a phone call. I
               told him he could, and he called a person stating, "Hey, don't
               come pick me up because I'm getting arrested and taken to
               jail." I asked Harris for his WADL and he told me he didn't
               have it. I asked him for his name and DOB and he told me
               information that I had already checked on. I again called
               whitcom on my radio and asked them to run his name which
               returned that he had a warrant. I asked them to call Adams
               County and confirm the warrant which was done. Dispatch also
               advised that it was extraditable and Adams County was going to
               fax the warrant to Whitman County Jail. I placed Harris under
               arrest and WSUPD Intern Jacob Berry handcuffed (DL) him and
               searched his pockets incident to arrest. I advised him of his
               Constitutional Rights and he told me he understood. I checked
               his backpack for weapons or contraband prior to transporting
               him to Whitman County Jail. Harris was booked into Whitman
               County Jail and I read him a copy of the warrant. He told me he
               understood and was turned over to the jail staff. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under

               *****DO NOT RELEASE - NOT FINISHED - ROUGH OUTLINE***** On
               January 24, 2014 at about 1458 hours I was dispatched to the
               report of a rape. I contacted the complainant Carla D. Griffin
               (11/10/67)/MI, by telephone as requested. I called C. Griffin
               at about 1506 hours. She told me that her daughter, Jelisa
               Shanice Griffin (03/07/95), had been raped and is currently in
               the hospital in Pullman. C. Griffin learned of the sexual
               assault from Pullman Regional Hospital (PRH) staff who called
               her today after her daughter attempted suicide in the hospital.
               C. Griffin was very upset and wanted something done
               immediately. She did not have any further information about the
               sexual assault. I gathered some background information about
               Griffin from her mother. I learned that she lives at Stephenson
               North room 1015 by herself. She just moved to Pullman a couple
               of weeks ago. Griffin is a new student at WSU. She is not in a
               dating relationship. Griffin does not have a history of harming
               herself. She likes to go by her middle name of Shanice. C.
               Griffin went on to tell me that she talks to her daughter on
               the phone every morning. They last spoke on Tuesday, January
               21, 2014. The mother said Griffin was in an upbeat mood,
               talking about classes and studying. Everything was normal.
               Griffin's sister from California also talked with her by
               telephone on Tuesday. They talked about Griffin trying to get a
               class changed. C. Griffin described her daughter as being
               family oriented. I attempted to contact Griffin at PRH at about
               1539 hours. I was unable to speak with her due to her medical
               condition. I did however meet with Elizabeth Hillman, PRH
               Social Services. PRH will call Whitcom when Griffin is able to
               speak with police before she is discharged. It is unknown at
               this time when that will be. I learned of the following
               timeline of events: Wednesday, January 22, 2014 Griffin went to
               PRH for the first time. She did not want to report the sexual
               assault to police. An advocate from Alternatives to Violence of
               the Palouse, (ATVP), was called. Griffin did not want the
               advocates services. Griffin did not want a rape kit done.
               Thursday, January 23, 2014 Griffin went back to PRH for pelvic
               pain. She was admitted to the hospital and still refused to
               report rape to police. Friday, January 24, 2014 Griffin

               attempted suicide while at PRH by putting a bag over her head.
               PRH contacted Griffin's family regarding the suicide. Later in
               the day at about 1213 hours Griffin fled PRH. She was on a
               medical hold and could not leave the hospital. Pullman Police
               found Griffin near Fireside Grille. She was brought back to
               PRH. After leaving Pullman Regional Hospital I notified
               Assistant Chief Hansen of the incident. As I was talking to him
               I received a message from Cpl. Kuhrt that the WSU Presidents
               Office wanted contact about the incident. I went to the WSU
               President's Office where I met with President Floyd's personal
               secretary Ginger. I briefed her on the basic information of the
               case. I was informed that the WSU Dean of Students and WSU
               Counseling Services were made aware of the incident. She told
               me that I can call her or President Floyd this weekend if
               needed. WSU is prepared to provided the necessary support
               needed to Griffin and her family. I then went down to WSU
               Counseling and Testing Services. I spoke with the Director
               Cassandra Nichols. She knew about Griffin's hospitalization.
               Nichols expressed support and concern for Griffin and her
               family. She gave me contact information and told me to call her
               this weekend if needed. I returned to the WSU Police Department
               and called C. Griffin at about 1705 hours. I spoke with her
               about not being able to speak with her daughter due to her
               medical condition. I also told her that she is safe at PRH. I
               expressed to C. Griffin that the hospital staff would like to
               reach out to her but they are not able because the patient will
               not give consent. I conveyed that I want to help her daughter
               but I can't without her wanting to report a crime and speak
               with police. She said she understood and will continue work
               with her daughter. C. Griffin said that she flying out from
               Detroit, MI Saturday morning to Pullman. In addition her other
               daughter and Griffin's sister is flying from California to
               Pullman in the morning (Sat). The investigation continues. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 24th day of January, 2014, in Pullman,

               passing the Washington Building when I noticed a laptop
               computer laying in the middle of the road. I collected the
               Laptop, which was a Toshiba Sattelite M505. The keyboard on the
               laptop was missing. Near by was a DVD video for 17 Again. I was
               unable to read the serial number on the laptop because it was
               apparently intentionally scratched off. I checked Spillman for
               stolen laptops of the same model and found one was stolen in
               Moscow on 01/02/14 (14-M00059). I have turned the laptop over
               to Officer Jones so he can attempt to access the computer hard

               at about 2228 hrs Cougar Security advised they could see two
               people on top of Kimborough Hall. Corporal Edwards and I
               responded. Corporal Edwards said she could see two individuals
               on the roof near the north side of the building. I climbed up
               on to the roof from the south side and contacted the
               individuals, Keenan W. Thomas (021295) and Aidan H. Lancaster
               (070295). I could see they both appeared to be under the age of
               21. I asked what they were doing and they said just trying to
               get a good view of campus. I could smell a burnt cigar smell
               and asked if they had been smoking marijuana. They denied
               having smoked marijuana. They provided me with a box of small
               cigars which did not appear to contain anything other than
               tobacco. As I was speaking with them I could smell the odor of
               intoxicants. I asked them for their ID's. Lancaster provided me
               with his Driver's License and Thomas provided his student ID
               and date of birth. The information provided indicated they were
               both under the age of 21. I confirmed the information provided
               through Dispatch. I asked how much they had to drink and they
               each admitted to having had a couple shots. I asked Thomas if I
               could check his eyes and he agreed. I administered a horizontal
               gaze nystagmus test and observed he had bloodshot and watery
               eyes, a lack of smooth pursuit, and a distinct and sustained
               nystagmus at maximum deviation. I could smell the odor of
               intoxicants on his breath as I administered the test. I asked
               Lancaster if I could check his eyes to and he agreed. I
               administered a horizontal gaze nystagmus test and observed he
               had bloodshot and watery eyes, a lack of smooth pursuit, and a
               distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation. I could
               smell the odor of intoxicants on his breath as I administered
               the test. I had them both climb down off the roof. I told them
               since I could tell they had been drinking but they were not
               extremely intoxicated I was going to be forwarding charges on
               both of them for MIP Exhibting as well as criminal trespass.
               They were released. Nothing further. I certify and declare

               NARRATIVE: On 01/25/14 at about 0059 hrs I was driving
               eastbound on Colorado St. when I noticed a male and female who
               were walking eastbound along Colorado St. near the Lower Soccer
               Field. They caught my attention because the female, later
               identified as Jacqueline M. Chissus (042795), appeared to be
               under the age of 21 and was having difficulty walking,
               staggering side to side. I contacted Chissus and the male,
               later identified as Jarrett B. Foote (041492), as they were
               walking through the Scott Coman parking lot. I asked if I could
               talk to them and they said yes. I told them I was concerned
               with how intoxicated Chissus was. I asked how much she had to
               drink and she admitted to having had a few beers. She did not
               think it was very many though. As Chissus spoke I could smell
               the odor of intoxicants on her breath and noticed she spoke
               with slurred speech. I asked if I could look at her eyes to see
               how much she had to drink and she agreed. I administered a
               horizontal gaze nystagmus test on her and observed she had
               bloodshot and watery eyes, a lack of smooth pursuit, and a
               distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation. Chissus
               stumbled once as she was trying to stand with her feet
               together. I asked if she had her ID with her and she said she
               did not. Chissus provided me with a name of Jacqueline C.
               Chissus (032595). I ran the information through Dispatch and
               they received no return. Chissus then gave me a date of birth
               of 042795 and Dispatch still received no return. I checked in
               the WSU computer system and found Chissus' real middle initial
               of M. Dispatch was able to confirm the information via a
               driver's return. I told Chissus I would be forwarding charges
               to the prosecutor for MIP exhibiting. She said she did not have
               a roommate so I walked with her to Regents Hall where we met
               one of her sober friends, Ellison D. Siks (011895), who agreed
               to stay with Chissus for the night. Nothing further. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.

               vehicle in front of me appeared to be traveling faster than the
               posted 25 MPH speed limit. I accelerated to keep up with the
               vehicle I paced the vehicle, LA TKG549, at 36 MPH. I initiated
               a traffic stop on the vehicle, turning on my overhead lights.
               The vehicle stopped in the Campus Commons South parking lot off
               Merman Dr. I contacted the driver, Nolan M. Darby (0051585),
               and told him the reason for the stop and the stop was being
               recorded. I asked Darby for his driver's license, vehicle
               registration, and proof of insurance. Darby was able to provide
               me his driver's license and an expired insurance. As I was
               speaking with Darby I observed his speech was slightly slurred
               and his actions were delibriate and slightly delayed. I could
               smell a strong odor of intoxicants emitting from the vehicle. I
               asked Darby how much he had to drink and he admitted to having
               consumed several beers throughout the night. I asked Darby if I
               could check his eyes to see how much he had to drink and he
               agreed. I had Darby sit sideways in his vehicle and I
               administered a horizontal gaze nystagmus test. I obesrved he
               had bloodshot and watery eyes, a lack of smooth purusit, and a
               distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation in both
               eyes. I asked Darby to exit his vehicle, which he did. I asked
               if he would be willing to perform some field sobriety tests so
               I could make sure he was not impaired and he agreed. I had
               Darby move to a nearby sidewalk which was straight and level.
               Darby was wearing tennis shoes, jeans, and a sweatshirt. The
               approximate temperature was 29 degrees. I told Darby I would be
               evaluating him based on how well he followed my instructions as
               well as how he performed on the tests. He said he understood.
               The first test I administered was the horizontal gaze nystagmus
               test. I told Darby to stand with his feet together and his arms
               at his sides. I told him to follow the tip of my pen with his
               eyes only and not to turn his head. Darby said he understood. I
               held my pen approximately 12-15 inches from Darby's face,
               slightly above eye level. I confirmed Darby's pupils were of
               equal size and his eyes tracked equally. I observed Darby had
               bloodshot and watery eyes, a lack of smooth pursuit in both

               eyes, a distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation
               in both eyes, an immideate onset of nystagmus in both eyes, and
               a vertical nystagmus in both eyes. Darby swayed side to side
               during the test. The second test I administered was the nine
               step walk and turn. I told Darby to imagine a straight line
               down the middle of the sidewalk. I told him to place his left
               foot on that line and to put his right foot in front of his
               left, touching heel to toe. I told him to keep his arms at his
               sides and to remain in this position while I explained the rest
               of the test. I told him not to start the test until instructed
               to do so. Darby said he understood. I told Darby when
               instructed to start to take nine steps, touching heel to toe,
               down the imaginary straight line. I told him to look at his
               feet the entrie time, count each step out loud, and keep his
               arms at his sides. I told Darby once he reached his ninth step
               to keep his front foot in place and to take a small series of
               steps with his back foot to turn around. I told him to take
               nine more steps back down the same imaginary straight line. I
               told Darby it was a continuous test and once he started not to
               stop until he was finished with the test. I reminded him to
               look at his feet the entire time, count each step out loud,
               touch each step heel to toe, and keep his arms at his sides. I
               demonstrated the test and Darby said he understood. As I was
               explaining the test Darby was unable to maintain his balance
               and stepped out of the starting position and used his right arm
               to touch a mailbox to maintain his balance. During his first
               nine steps Darby used his arms for balance throughout. Darby
               stopped after steps 0/1, 1/2, and 2/3. Darby did not turn as
               instructed, not turning around at all. Darby performed his
               second nine steps backward. Darby used his arms for balance
               throughout the second nine steps. He stepped offline to his
               left on step 0/1, and missed touching heel to toe on step 2/3.
               The second test I administered was the one leg stand. I told
               Darby to stand with his feet together and his arms at his
               sides. I told him to remain in this position while I explained
               the test and not to begin until instructed to do so. Darby said
               he understood. I told Darby when instructed to begin to choose
               one foot, whichever he was most comfortable with, and to lift
               that foot so his toe was approximately six inches off the
               ground. I told Darby to keep both legs straight and his arms at
               his sides. I told him to look at his toe and to count out loud
               by 1000's (1001, 1002, 1003 and so on) until instructed to
               stop. I told Darby if he put his foot down to pick it right
               back up and continue where he left off. I demonstrated the test
               and Darby said he undestood my instructions. Darby chose to
               stand on his right foot, raising his left. Darby only lifted
               his toe about 2 inches off the ground and did not look at his
               toe initially. Darby counted 1001, 1002, then counted 3, 4, 5
               and so on. Darby used his arms for balance throughout the test.
               On his count of 7 I reminded Darby to look at his toe. He put
               his foot down on his count of 9 and 13. Darby counted to 14 in
               30 seconds. At this time it was my opinion that Darby's ability
               to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. I asked
               Darby if he would submit to a PBT and he refused. I advised
               Darby he was under arrest for DUI and placed him in handcuffs

               (double locked). I advised Darby of his right to remain silent
               and his right to an attorney. I placed Darby in the back of my
               patrol car while Corporal Edwards contacted Darby's girlfriend
               to come get the dog that was in his car. I transported Darby to
               the Pullman PD holding faclity for the breath test. I read
               Darby his Constitutional Rights from the DUI packet at 0308 hrs
               and he signed stating they were read to him and stating he was
               waiving his rights. I checked Darby's mouth at 0308 hrs and
               found no foreign substances. I read Darby his implied consent
               warnings for breath at 0311 hrs and he signed stating so. I
               asked Darby if he would submit to a breath test and he said
               "Yes". I checked the yes box on the DUI packet and had Darby
               initial next to it. I asked if he was confused at all by the
               implied consent warnings and he said "no". I checked the no box
               on the DUI packet and had him initial next to it. I asked Darby
               the questions from the DUI packet. Darby admitted to drinking
               alcohol and said he had about 6 12oz Blue Moons and 1 yager
               bomb. He said he started drinking at 0830 and stopped at 0015
               hrs. Darby did not believe his ablity to drive was affected by
               his alcohol usage. I checked the Datamaster instrument and
               found it in proper working order, with the RFI antenna
               attached, the breath tube warm to the touch, and the
               temperature display showing a temperature of 34.00 degrees.
               Darby provided a breath sample of .171 at 0329 hrs and a second
               sample of .195 at 0331 hrs. The test was administered in
               accordance with teh methods approved by the Washington State
               Toxicologist pursuant to the Washington Administrative Code. I
               provided Darby with a copy of the following documents: notice
               of hearing/conditions of release, breath test document, and
               hearing request/fee waiver form. I placed Darby in a holding
               cell while I completed paperwork. I later returned and issued
               Darby criminal citation #4Z0166636 for DUI. I explained the
               citation to him, he received his copy, and was released.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 25 day of January, 2014, in
               Pullman, Washington. _______________________________________
