               parking lot across from Beasley Coliseum. I called the
               complainant/victim, Garrett A. Burnham (08/23/92). Burnham told
               me he parked his vehicle, AJC0913/WA, a 2006 Subaru in the
               Yellow lot at about 0945 hours on January 17, 2014. When he
               returned to his car at about 1220 hours that same day the car
               was damaged. Burnham said there is a six (6) inch scratch on
               the driver's side passenger door. There are also several
               smaller scratches surrounding it. Burnham said the large
               scratch looks like it was made by a key. Damage is estimated at
               $200.00. Burnham has no idea who damaged his car. There are no
               suspects, witnesses, or leads at this time. No further

               dispatched to the WSU Student Recreation Center (SRC) for an
               male with a head injury. I responded to the SRC where I
               contacted John R. Morrison (11/02/92), the patient. He told me
               that he was running stairs at Martin Stadium with the WSU
               Wrestling Club. He hit his head on a blue piece of equipment
               parked at the top of the stands under the scoreboard. He ran
               from Martin Stadium to the SRC to seek assistance. Pullman Fire
               personnel arrived and evaluated Morrison's injury. He had an
               inch long laceration on the top of his head. Pullman Fire
               personnel recommended that Morrison seek medical treatment for
               his laceration at WSU Student Health or at Pullman Regional
               Hospital. Morrison did not want to go by ambulance. I provided
               a courtesy transport from the SRC to Martin Stadium. Morrison
               picked up his belongings that he had left behind. He showed me
               where the injury occurred. It was between sections 16 and 17. I
               could see a blue scissors lift parked at the top of the
               stairway and blood on the ground. I photographed the area. I
               provided a second courtesy transport from Martin Stadium to WSU
               Health and Wellness for Morrison. I have forwarded this
               incident to Shawn Deeds, WSU Athletics Event Management. No

               NARRATIVE: On 01-18-2014 at about 1345 hrs I was dispatched to
               a report of lost property at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital,
               located at 200 SE Ott Road. I contacted the complainant,
               Lucrissa K. Peterson (DOB 09-27-1946), on the telephone.
               Peterson reported that on 01-17-2014 between 1600 hrs and 1800
               hrs she lost her ring in the Veterinary Teaching Hospital
               parking lot near the main entrance. Peterson said she was
               parked in the handicapped spaces near the main entrance and
               recalls hearing something fall and hit the ground as she
               entered her vehicle. Peterson did not realize at the time that
               it must have been her ring that had fallen to the ground.
               Peterson discovered today that her ring was missing. Peterson
               described her ring as: Black Hills Gold, rose pattern, large in
               size with length reaching between knuckles, gold in color. The
               value of the ring is estimated to be $200.00. Peterson will
               call the Veterinary Teaching Hospital this week and inquire
               about her missing ring. Peterson said she will contact the
               police department if her ring is located. I responded to the
               area and searched the parking lot. I did not locate the ring.
               No further action at this time. Olmstead/339 I certify and

               or what vehicle may have been involved in the incident. He told

               did not know if there was any damage to the vehicle or pole but
               wanted to make sure we knew WSU Football would pay for any

               advised of an intoxicated and aggressive male who was walking
               with a female down D St. from Colorado St. I was across the
               street with Officer Westerman on a separate call at the time so
               I responded. Cougar Security told me the male had been yelling
               and hitting street signs as he walked down Colorado St. As they
               were telling me this I saw the male, later identified as Riley
               N. Yager (071195), trying to pull away from the female, later
               identified as Kathleen A. Newsom (042095). Newsom cornered
               Yager against the fence for the lower soccer field and Yager
               began yelling at her. I contacted them and had Yager sit down.
               I asked Newsom what was going on and she told me Yager is just
               a mean drunk and she was trying to get him to go back to the
               dorm but he was not cooperating. I asked Yager what was going
               on and he said he was frustrated with his girlfriend (Newsom)
               and just wanted to be away from her. I asked Newsom if the
               argument was physical at any point in time and she said no. I
               saw no physical indications otherwise. Yager told me he was
               planning on staying with Newsom for the night because he was in
               town visiting. I told him I thought that was a bad idea because
               they were already arguing. I asked him to try and call a friend
               to stay with. I told Newsom Yager was going to stay with
               another friend so he could sober up. I told her I was concerned
               about the argument between them escalating. Newsom was allowed
               to leave. I told Yager I believed alcohol was the main
               contributing factor to the argument between he and Newsom. I
               told him I would be forwarding charges to the prosecutor for
               MIP exhibiting. Yager was allowed to leave with his sober
               friend who came to get him. Nothing further. I certify and

               NARRATIVE: On 01/19/14 at approximately 0043 hours, I was
               driving westbound on Colorado St when I saw two males walking
               up the steep grassy hill that leads to the Bookie Loading dock.
               I found this odd because walking that way leads to a dead end.
               I pulled into the parking lot and saw both males in front of my
               patrol car. One of the males, later identified as Dylan Justice
               Curtis 10/08/93, was carrying two Keystone Light Beers, one in
               each hand. Curtis appeared to be under the age of 21. As I came
               to a stop Curtis started to quickly walk up a dirt hill while
               the second male, Damon Jerome Abel 08/01/93, stood still. I
               yelled to Curtis, saying "Stop Police." Curtis did but he no
               longer had the beers in his hands. I saw both can on the side
               of the hill about half way up. I told Curtis to come back down
               and grab his beers off the ground. Curtis did so. I asked
               Curtis and Abel if they had their ID's. Curtis said he did not
               have his ID and Abel provided his WADL. I asked Abel how much
               he had to drink. Curtis said he had a couple of drinks a few
               hours ago. I could smell the odor of intoxicants coming from
               Abel's breath as he spoke. I asked Abel if I could check his
               eyes and he said I could. During the HGN test I observed, equal
               tracking and lack of smooth pursuit. I next asked Curtis how
               old he was. Curtis said he was 20 years old. I asked Curtis how
               much he had to drink and he said one beer. I could also smell
               the odor of intoxicants coming from Curtis' breath. I asked
               Curtis about the beers he was holding and he said he found them
               on the ground and pointed to a spot in the parking lot. I asked
               why he would pick up two unopened cans of beer if he was under
               21 years old. Curtis said he was going to recycle the cans
               because he is an environmental engineer student. I asked Curtis
               why he tried to walk up the hill away from me when I pulled up.
               Curtis said he did not know I was a Police Officer. I asked
               Curtis if his intention was to recycle the cans then why did he
               drop them on the hillside. Curtis said the slipped out of his
               hands. I explained to Curtis that he was lying to me because
               when something slips out of your hands on a hill it would
               tumble down the hill rather than sitting perfectly next to each

               other as they were. I told Curtis that I would like him to be
               honest with me and he said, "because you said you were police,
               I knew I would get in trouble if I had beer cans." I told
               Curtis that he was under arrest for MIP and handcuffed (D/L)
               him. Intern Berry searched Curtis incident to arrest at my
               direction. No weapons or illegal items were found. I spoke with
               Abel again and told him that I would not be arresting him for
               MIP Exhibiting because he did not try to take off as Curtis
               did. However I told Abel that he would be referred to student
               conduct for his alcohol violation. Abel said he under stood and
               I told him he was free to go or he could wait for Curtis to be
               released. Abel said he would stick around. I researched Curtis'
               name and found he had no prior contacts with local Police. I
               told Curtis that I would be forwarding charges of possession of
               alcohol by a minor to the prosecutor. Curtis said he understood
               and was released from custody. Curtis and Abel walked home.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 19th day of January, 2014, in

               NARRATIVE: On 01/19/14 at approximately 0111 hours. I was
               sitting at a red light at the intersection of Colorado St and
               Stadium Way facing eastbound on Stadium Way. There were five
               individuals standing on the northeast corner of the
               intersection waiting to cross the street. All five individuals
               started to walk into the intersection before the signal
               crossing changed. I shined my spot light at them but they
               continued to cross the street even though the street crossing
               displayed do not cross. Once my light turned green I pulled
               into the Streit Perham turn around where the group was headed.
               I stopped and told the group that I wanted to speak with them.
               I asked the group why they crossed the street when it said do
               not cross even when I flashed my spotlight at them. One of the
               subjects said they did not know who was flashing their light at
               them and they were scared to look. Of the five individuals one
               person stood out. One female, later identified as Madison Haley
               Lynd 09/19/94, was swaying side to side and looked unsteady on
               her feet. She stood out because everybody else appeared to be
               sober. I asked Lynd to speak with me away from the group. Once
               away from the group, I asked Lynd how much she had to drink
               tonight. Lynd said nothing. I told Lynd that I knew she was
               lying because I could smell the odor of intoxicants on her
               breath. I again asked Lynd how much she had to drink and she
               said two shots. When I was talking to Lynd I noticed she had a
               large purse over her right shoulder. The bag was wide open and
               sticking out of the top was a blue bottle that I recognized to
               be vodka. I could also see a container of orange juice next to
               the vodka. I asked Lynd if I could check her eyes and she said
               I could. During the HGN test I observed, equal tracking, lack
               of smooth pursuit, and distinct and sustained nystagmus at
               maximum deviation. I asked Lynd if I could see vodka and she
               handed it to me. The fifth of vodka was almost completely full.
               I asked if there was anything else in her purse that she
               shouldn't have. Lynd said no and I could look if I wanted. I
               looked inside the purse without moving anything and did not
               notice anything else illegal. I told Lynd that she was under
               arrest for MIP and handcuffed (D/L) her. I advised Lynd of her

               right to counsel. I placed Lynd in the backseat of my patrol
               car while I spoke with the rest of the group. I asked the group
               if anybody was Lynd's roommate. Everybody said no but one
               female, Kaytlin Diane Bjorkman 03/15/95, said she was willing
               to watch her for the rest of the night. I researched Lynd's
               name and found she had no prior contacts or arrests. I told
               Lynd that I would be sending charges of MIP Possession to the
               prosecutor. Lynd stated she understood and I released Lynd to
               Bjorkman's custody. Nothing further. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               and contacted the two residents of the room, Hayden F. Hutton
               and Bryce R. Howell. I asked if either of them had medical
               marijuana cards and they said they did not. They both admitted
               to being under the age of 21, which was confirmed by their
               Washignton Driver's Licenses. I told Hutton and Howell they had
               two options. I told them they could go get whatever marijuana
               and paraphernalia they had in the room, we could walk down
               stairs and destroy it, and I would only send the incident to
               student conduct. I told them the second option was to require I
               obtain a search warrant. I told them I would seize their room
               and they would be free to leave. I would apply for a search
               warrant which may or may not be granted. I told them if the
               search warrant was granted I would return to their room and
               search it. I told them whatever was found on the search would
               be dealt with through student conduct and the court. Hutton and
               Howell both agreed to go retrieve their marijuana and pipes.
               They each produced a small bag with marijuana in it and a multi
               colored glass pipe. I walked downstairs with them and observed
               as they destroyed the items. Nothing further. I certify and

               NARRATIVE: On 01/19/14 at approximately 0234 hours, I was
               driving on B St nearing Campus St when I saw three males
               walking towards Thompson Flats. Two of the three males were
               carrying silver aluminum cans but I was unable to see the logo
               on the can due to the distance between us. The three males kept
               looking behind them at me which sparked my interest. I drove
               around the block using Veteran's Way. When I reached the area
               of Spokane St and Thompson Flats I saw all three males again
               but now only one person had a can. The route they walked had no
               garbage cans along it. I exited my car and started walking
               towards them. As I got closer to the group, I noticed all three
               males appeared to be under the age of 21. I asked the group if
               the had a second to talk and they all stopped. I turned on my
               VieVu camera and started recording. I told the male who was now
               missing is can that either he could go pick it up or receive a
               $310 dollar littering citation. The male, later identified as
               Tanner Reid Anthony 01/12/94, walked a few feet away and picked
               up his can. The other male with a can, Hayden Marchal Bodine
               10/24/93, was still holding the Coors Light beer can. Both cans
               were Coors Light beer cans. I asked for the three male's ID's.
               The third male, identified as Dillon Joseph Gee 04/24/92,
               handed me his WADL first. Anthony and Bodine also provided
               their WADL's. Bodine appeared to be very intoxicated. Bodine
               took a full minute to get his ID out of his wallet as he
               stumbled back and forth on the grass hill we were standing on.
               While struggling to get his ID out, Bodine spilled most of his
               can of beer down the front of his pants. Gee had two bottles of
               hard alcohol in his backpack that he showed to me. Gee is 21
               years old as indicated on his driver's license. Gee later told
               me that he did not provide the beer to Bodine and Anthony. I
               researched Bodine and Anthony and they both did not have any
               prior contacts for alcohol related offenses. Bodine and Anthony
               are not and never have been WSU Students. Gee used to be a WSU
               Student but is no longer one. I told Bodine and Anthony that I

               and explained the process. Gee indicated that they were all
               heading to a friend's house they were staying at on Latah St. I
               told the three they were free to go and I cleared. Charges of
               MIP Possession will be forwarded to the prosecutor on Bodine
               and Anthony. No charges will be filed on Gee. Nothing further.

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 01/20/14 at approximately 0300 hours,
               I responded to a drugs call at Regents Hall room 236. The RED
               on duty was reporting the odor of marijuana coming from that
               room. Upon arrival I knocked the door of room 236 and a few
               moments later a female, later identified as Rachel Linn Fesler
               02/03/95, answered the door. Fesler was wrapped up in a blanket
               and appeared to have just woken up. I explained the reason I
               was at her door and told her that if she turned over her
               marijuana and smoking devices, this incident would be handled
               though the university rather than the courts. While explained
               this I heard a male's voice say, "It's mine." The male was
               identified as Thomas Gerald Odonnell 07/06/94 and he stated the
               marijuana in the room belonged to him. Both Odonnell and Fesler
               were wrapped up in blanket and were most likely naked
               underneath them. I told the two that they could close the door
               and put clothes on and they did so. When the door was reopened,
               Odonnell handed me a sandwich bag with approximately 2 grams of
               marijuana in it. He also had a small metal pipe that was used
               for smoking his marijuana. I told Fesler that she would be
               referred to student conduct because due to her smoking with
               Odonnell in her room. Fesler stated she understood. I told
               Odonnell he would be referred for the same thing plus having
               the marijuana. I walked with Odonnell outside where he
               destroyed his marijuana and threw the pipe away in the garbage.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 20th day of January, 2014, in
