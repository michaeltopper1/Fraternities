               on Forest Way approaching Olympia Ave when I saw a blue vehicle
               blocking the upper Columbia Village parking lot. There were two
               housing workers standing next to the vehicle which lead me to
               believe it was unoccupied. I turned around and pulled into the
               parking lot and saw that the vehicle, WA AJS5407, was
               unoccupied. There was WSU Parking permit COL5055 being

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On January 10, 2014 at about 1500 hours
               I was dispatched to the report of a two (2) street signs found
               in a dumpster at LARC. I responded to the building where I
               located the dumpster. I opened the lid to the large dumpster.
               It had been dumped recently as it was almost empty. It looked
               like someone dumped a small office trash can in it. I could see
               two green and white traffic street signs on the bottom of the
               dumpster. The signs read "TERREVIEW" and "YATES". It is unknown
               how long the signs have been in the dumpster. Due to the large
               size of the dumpster and the warning signs posted on it I did
               not climb inside of it. I was unable to reach or remove the
               signs. I returned to the WSU Police Department and attempted to
               contact City of Pullman Public Works. I was unable to speak
               with anyone. The signs most likely belong or belonged to the
               City of Pullman as Terre View and Yates are both City streets.
               I will make another attempt to contact the City of Pullman on
               Monday, January 13, 2014. Investigation continues. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.

               08-14 at about 1748 hours I received an email from Assistant
               Chief Hansen asking me to look into an incident that may have
               occurred on campus. In the email I saw a message that was sent
               to the WSU Police email address (police@wsu.edu) with
               information about a rape that had occurred. The message read as
               follows; Hello my name is Cory Arnold. A friend of mine who is
               an international/exchange student from Japan studying at the
               Pullman campus at WSU for the 13/14 year came to visit me
               during the winter break. She has told me that bad things had
               happened and that she wanted to go home (to Japan) but wouldn't
               ever clarify. Eventually, she told me that a boy, another
               exchange student from Saudi Arabia, raped her on two different
               occasions after she turned him down. Even though she had
               blocked communication with him on things like Facebook, he
               knows where she is staying and continues to bother her. She is
               staying for the spring semester that just begun, but she keeps
               telling me she's worried and scared. I'm not exactly sure when
               the rapes occurred myself, but it may have been some time ago
               (Japanese people often are too shy or afraid ro report such
               things immediately, which is one reason many people get away
               with molestation in Japan. She, like many others, feel it may
               have been her fault because she turned him down, but I tried to
               tell her otherwise). Whether or not it can be proved or what
               kind of charges she'd want to push for if it could, I don't
               know. But at the very least he needs to be kept away from her.
               Her name is Miho Oga and the perpetrators name is Nasser
               Alsubaie. **End of message** I sent Arnold an email asking him
               to call me. On 01-09-14 at about 1900 hours I spoke to Arnold.
               He said he did not have anymore information than what was in
               the email. I ended my call with Arnold and attempted to contact
               the victim, Miho Oga, at the listed address for her, Orton Hall
               room 629. I knocked on the door, there was no answer. It did
               not appear as if anybody lived in the room since there was no
               nametag or decor on the door. I returned to the station and
               attempted to call the phone number that we had listed for Oga.
               It went straight to a voicemail that sounded like a male. I did
               not leave a message. On 01-10-14 I called Arnold back and asked

               him if he had a phone number for Oga. He said no, as he and Oga
               spoke through Facebook and Skype. He told me he would message
               her and ask for her phone number and address. At about 2030
               hours I received an email from Arnold with Oga's address of 880
               NE Providence Ct #R101 and a phone number of 509-768-9388. I
               went to Oga's address and knocked on the door. A female
               answered and confirmed her name was Miho. She told me that she
               would prefer to talk somewhere else since she had roommates. I
               offered to drive to to WSUPD, which she said was fine. Before
               leaving her parking lot I asked Oga where this sexual assualt
               occurred. She said "at his apartment". I asked where that was
               and she said "Dabco". I asked Oga if any of this happened on
               campus and she said "no". At that point I contacted the PPD
               supervisor, Sgt. Dornes. I briefed him on the case and offerred
               to drive Oga there. I transported Oga from her residence to
               PPD. I contacted Dornes and let him know she was in the lobby.
               Incident occurred off campus. Transferred to PPD (case 14-
               P00218). Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 11th day of January,

               the room and he said no. I asked if he had a medical marijuana
               card and he said he did not. I asked why his room smelled like
               marijuana and he said he did not smell anything. I told him I
               could smell the odor of marijuana coming from the room and
               advised him I was going to give him two options. I explained to
               Van Hoff he could either retrieve whatever marijuana and
               smoking devices were in the room, I would have him destroy the
               items, and I would send the incident to student conduct only. I
               told him the other option was he could require I obtain a
               search warrant, which the judge may or may not grant. I told
               him the room would be seized and he would be free to leave but
               could not enter the room. I Told Van Hoff if the warrant was
               granted I would serve the warrant and whatever was found would
               be dealt with through student conduct and the court. I told Van
               Hoff to think about it and asked him to provide his driver's
               license, which he did. After checking Van Hoff's ID I asked
               which option he would like to choose. He asked me to explain
               them again and I did so. Van Hoff hesitated and asked what
               would happen if the room was not his. I asked him where the
               people who lived in the room were and he looked to his left. I
               could hear someone exiting the closet and a male, later
               idetnfied as Kory W. O'Connor (120894), came out. I told both
               of them to come sit down in the hallway. I asked for O'Connor's
               ID, which he provided. O'Connor said he was a resident of the
               room and that he did not have a medical marijuana card. I
               provided O'Connor with the same two options that I explained to
               Van Hoff previously. O'Connor chose to retrieve the items from

               the room. He produced a small glass jar with marijuana residue
               in it as well as a glass pipe with burnt marijuana residue
               inside. I followed O'Connor out to the dumpster and had him
               dispose of the items. Nothing further. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               11 day of January, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.
