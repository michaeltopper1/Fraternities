               NARRATIVE: On 01-20-2014 at about 0827 hrs I was dispatched to
               a welfare check outside the Old Bookie, located at 700 NE
               Thatuna Street. The complainant, David R. Turnbull (DOB 03-12-
               1961), had reported that an individual appeared to be sleeping
               outside the building. Officer Jones and I arrived on scene and
               contacted an individual walking away from the area. The
               individual was identified as Dante L. Davidson (DOB 01-20-
               1995). Davidson said he was not sleeping but was just sitting
               on the bench outside the building. Davidson explained that he
               was contacted by law enforcement last night and had been
               transported to the hospital. For more information, see related
               case #14-W0206. Davidson told me that he was separated from his
               friends and had cut his finger last night. I noticed that
               Davidson had a bandage on his finger and what appeared to be
               dried blood on his pants. Davidson said he was waiting for his
               friends to wake up, and then he was planning on leaving town.
               Davidson said he had locked his keys in his vehicle. Davidson
               was aware of his surroundings, had a working cellular telephone
               in his pocket, and appeared to be able to care for himself.
               Davidson said he was going to walk to McDonalds. I suggested
               that he call a locksmith or tow truck to assist with getting
               his keys out of his vehicle. Officer Jones and I cleared the
               scene. No further action at this time. Olmstead/339 I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the

               NARRATIVE: On January 20, 2014 at about 0853 hours WSU Police
               were notified that there was an alarm activation called in at
               WSU Health and Wellness by an employee. The employee told
               Whitcom they were going to call a responsible and no need for
               officers to respond. I responded to the building. It was
               locked, employees were showing up for work. I contacted the
               complainant, Joyce G. Wood (01/19/53). She thought her alarm
               code was not working. I entered my alarm code to reset the
               alarm. Whitcom verified that the alarm was reset and they had
               not received any alarms from the the building. I could still
               hear an alarm sounding in the exam area. I located a computer
               cart with a backup power supply unit on it sounding an alarm. I
               unplugged the computer and backup power supply from the wall.
               The alarm stopped. I told Wood that she should contact their IT
               support to get the power supply repaired. Assistance provided,
               no further investigation. The building burglary alarm was
               unfounded. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
