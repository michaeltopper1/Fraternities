               M. Brimhall (DOB 09-17-1957) reported that a suspicious letter

               27-2014 at about 0838 hrs I was dispatched to a report of a
               suspicious letter at the Washington State University (WSU)
               Admissions Office, located in the Lighty Student Services
               Building #370, 1815 NE Wilson Road. I arrived on scene and
               contacted Karen M. Brimhall (DOB 09-17-1957). Brimhall is an
               employee in the admissions office. Brimhall furnished me with
               an envelope containing a letter that had been delivered to the
               admissions office in the mail sometime last week. The envelope
               was addressed to "Washington State University, 370 Lighty
               Student Services Building". The return address on the envelope
               was from a "C Bodner" in Williams Bay, Wisconsin. The envelope
               contained a photocopy of a handwritten note and three
               apparently random letters addressed to "Charles Bodner". I read
               the note and determined that it was not directed towards WSU or
               anyone who is affiliated with the university. The note was not
               threatening in nature and discussed various ridiculous ideas
               for government reform, including references of "lazy bum liars"
               and "dope dealing welfare frauds". The note encouraged people
               who "work for a living" to petition the government. After
               reviewing the contents of the envelope, I determined that no
               crime had been committed. I conducted an internet search for
               "Charles Bodner" and found that someone had mentioned his name
               in a blog. The blog narrative stated that Bodner had sent
               random paperwork to a hotel. I also found an online copy of a
               recall petition for the governor of Wisconsin. One of the
               signatures on the petition was signed as, Charles Bodner, 68
               Johnson Ter, Williams Bay, WI 53191. The envelope, and all the
               contents, were scanned and downloaded into Spillman. No further
               action at this time. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this __27__ day

               NARRATIVE: On January 27, 2014 at about 1003 hours I was
               dispatched to a report of a stolen iPhone. I contacted the
               complainant/victim, William Co. Wolcott (01/29/94), in the WSU
               Police Department lobby. Wolcott told me he set his iPhone on a
               bench in the locker room unattended while he showered. When he
               returned the iPhone was gone. He does not know who may have
               taken the phone. This happened at about 0930 hours. The iPhone
               was in an armband case with earbuds connected to it. The
               armband and earbuds were taken as well. Wolcott attempted to
               track the phone using Find My iPhone but was unsuccessful. The
               following items were stolen: iPhone 4 Black in color SN:
               C38F4FVKDDP9 Value: $200.00 iPhone 4 case Black in color Value:
               $30.00 Armband Blue in color Value: $40.00 Earbuds Red in color
               Value: $25.00 The phone has been used on the WSU wireless
               network. The phone uses Verizon as a carrier. The phone number
               associated with the device is 509-592-3447. A stolen property
               form will be filled out and sent to WSU Police Records. I will
               notify WSU IT Security of the phone theft so it can be tracked.
               There are no witnesses, suspects, or leads at this time. No
               further investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 27th day of January,

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 01-27-2014 at about 1521 hrs I was
               dispatched to a report of a theft in the parking lot on the
               north side of the K House, located at 720 NE Thatuna Street.
               Dispatch advised that personnel from WSU Parking Services had
               located a stolen parking permit displayed in a vehicle. I
               arrived on scene and contacted the WSU Parking Services
               employees. The parking lot was signed as requiring a green WSU
               parking permit. The parking services employees advised that
               they had located a stolen permit inside a parked and unoccupied
               vehicle. The vehicle was identified as a maroon, 1993 Saturn
               (WA Lic. ACR3901). The registered owner of this vehicle was
               identified as Toni L. Zonneveld (DOB 12-04-1969) from Everett,
               Washington. I saw that WSU parking permit #GN2 5349 was
               displayed inside the vehicle on the windshield. This parking
               permit had been reported as stolen property on 08-29-2013.
               According to the original theft report, Lucas E. Holbert (DOB
               01-03-1993) had reported that he parked his red, 1991 Chrysler
               (WA Lic. 638YKE) in a parking lot near Carpenter Hall on 08-29-
               2013. When he returned to his vehicle, he discovered that the
               parking permit (#GN2 5349) was gone. For more information, see
               case #13-W3665. The value of the stolen parking permit was
               determined to be $470.48 when it was new at the beginning of
               the school year. The current value of the parking permit as of
               01-27-2014 was determined to be $294.05. I photographed the
               vehicle along with the stolen permit displayed inside the
               windshield, and the photographs were later downloaded into
               Spillman. The vehicle was wheel-locked by WSU Parking Services
               employees, and I cleared the scene. Investigation continues.

               been slashed. I contacted the reporting party, later identified
               as KwestM Osborn (041595), and was told the following. Osborn
               told me he had parked his vehicle in the Red Parking Lot near
               the Valley Crest Apartments around 1800 hrs on 011814 and when
               he returned around 1533 hrs on 012714 he noticed that both of
               the rear tires on his vehicle (ALT2371) were flat. He went on
               to tell me he believed that they may have been slashed, but had
               no suspects and added that he hasn't had any issues with
               anyone. I told him I would take a look at his vehicle and
               photograph the damage, which he told me was fine. Upon finding
               Osborn's vehicle I noticed that both rear tires were flat. I
               photographed both tires and upon inspecting the tires saw no
               indication that they had been cut. I contacted Osborn again,
               who told me he was having someone come down to replace the
               tires and would let me know about any damage to the tires that
               was discovered. After speaking with Osborn I downloaded the
               photos I had taken and cleared the call. I will await contact
               from Osborn before proceeding further. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 012713 around 2100 hrs Ofc Westerman
               and I responded to the Physical Education Building for a report
               of a female, later identified as Sharifah Nicholson (080167),
               who was complaining of shortness of difficulty breathing. Upon
               our arrival we contacted Nicholson and were told the following.
               Nicholson explained that she was having difficulty breathing
               and had recently been treated and placed on blood pressure
               medication, which she had been taking as prescribed. She went
               on to tell us she had chest pain, which had radiated up along
               the right side of her face, in addition to feeling light headed
               and having tremors in her hands. As we continued to speak I
               could see that Nicholson was in pain and having difficulty
               speaking before Pullman Ambulance personnel arrived. Upon their
               arrival it was decided to transport Nicholson to Gritman
               Hospital for further evaluation, which they did a short time
               later. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 27th day of January,
               2014, in Pullman, Washington.
