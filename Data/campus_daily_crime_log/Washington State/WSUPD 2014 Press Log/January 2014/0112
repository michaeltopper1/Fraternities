               fire at the Marriott Hotel construction site. A construction
               heater caught the building on fire. Damage is estimated at

               ____NO OTHER UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On January 12, 2014 at
               about 1357 hours Pullman Fire and WSU Police were dispatched to
               a structure fire at the Marriott Hotel construction site
               located at 1121 NE North Fairway Rd. Amy C. Winsor was walking
               her dog on North Fairway Rd near the Marriott Hotel
               construction site. Winsor observed flames coming from the east
               side of north wing of the building. I responded to the area
               with Sgt. Griffin and Cpl. Edwards. There were flames showing
               from the east side of the building. The flames were coming from
               a construction vent opening located on a stairwell between the
               third and fourth floors. Cpl. Edwards and I photographed and
               took video of the fire. There were two (2) large opening on the
               east side of the building that were boarded up with oriented
               strand board (OSB). The openings are for windows that have not
               been installed yet. The upper opening is where the fire was
               located. There was a piece of sheet metal with a hole cut into
               it attached to the OSB. Fire was coming out of the north east
               side and burning the building. Pullman Fire and Whitman County
               Fire District 12 responded to the building. The firefighters
               successfully extinguished the fire with minimal damage. They
               had to forcibly make entry into the building. Pullman Fire
               Prevention Officer Dragoo and I investigated the cause and
               origin of the fire. There was a large natural gas construction
               heater positioned on the landing between the third and fourth
               floors. A similar heater was position on the ground floor in
               this stairwell. The construction heater had a sheet metal
               exhaust pipe. The "L" shaped pipe was designed to attach to the
               top of the heater. The pipe is designed to go through the sheet
               metal attached to the OSB in the window opening. The hot
               exhaust gasses can then be safely vented from the building.
               Upon my arrival I noticed that the exhaust pipe was not
               sticking out through the hole. It is unknown if the exhaust
               pipe was not installed properly and/or if the weather affected
               it. Pullman experienced high winds on Saturday, January 11 and
               Sunday, January 12, 2014. According to the National Weather
               Service Pullman Regional Airport Reporting Station there was
               sustained winds of at least 20 MPH with gust in the upper 40

               MPH range. Damage was limited. The piece of OSB burned, there
               was some siding damage and the window frame had burned. The
               fire was kept to the area immediately surrounding the exhaust
               vent. The wood framed building is still under construction. The
               building is partially sheet rocked. In the area of the fire
               there was no sheet rock. It is open wood frame construction
               with open access to the attic area. There were about five (5)
               or six (6) sheetrock contractors working in the building at the
               time of the fire. None of the contractors were working in this
               wing of the building. I contacted their supervisor***. The main
               site superintendent from Vandervert Construction was out of the
               area and unable to respond. The origin of the fire is the
               exhaust pipe from the construction heater. The cause of the
               fire is classified as accidental. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this ____ day of

               was coming from room 431. Piper stated there were several
               voices inside. Upon arrival I knocked on the door to room 431
               for several minutes without a response. I could smell the odor
               of burnt marijuana and masking agents coming from the room.
               With the help of Piper I was able to find out the occupants
               names for room 431. Scott A. Willis 02/21/95 and Adham H.
               Abukweik 04/11/94 are registered to that room. While speaking
               with Piper an RA, Briana N. Welsh 02/21/93 said she had seen a
               male leave the room and walk to his room on the 4th floor.
               Welsh recognized the male as Skyler B. Hutchinson 05/26/95 from
               prior contacts. Due to my prior contacts with Hutchinson, I had
               his phone number. I called Hutchinson who agreed to meet with
               me at his room. When Hutchinson arrived, we spoke in the 4th
               floor study lounge. I told Hutchinson that he was not being
               detained and was free to leave at any point. I explained the
               situation to Hutchinson and asked about his evolvement.
               Hutchinson stated he had been in his friend's room, Willis,
               playing video games when Willis' new roommate Abukweik came
               home. Hutchinson stated Abukweik had two other friend's with
               him and they were the ones smoking. Hutchinson said he did not
               smoke any of the marijuana. Through my contact with Hutchinson
               I did not notice any signs of marijuana consumption. Hutchinson
               appeared to be honest and forthcoming with me. However I told
               Hutchinson that he would be referred to student conduct for his
               involvement in this case. I next spoke with Willis. I told
               Willis as he sat down that he was not being detained and was
               free to leave at any point. I asked Willis what happened in his
               room. Willis stated he was in his room watching youtube videos
               when his new roommate, Abukweik, "did stuff." I asked Willis
               about the marijuana and Willis said he did not smoke any. I
               asked Willis who was smoking and he said he did not know their
               names. Willis did not appear to be as forthcoming as Hutchinson
               had been. Willis was very vague in his answers and it appeared

               as if he was acting surprised when I confronted him with
               information I had already found out. I asked Willis about his
               new roommate, Abukweik. Willis said Abukweik had just moved
               into the room about 5 hours before I contacted him. Willis
               stated he did not know anything about Abukweik. I told Willis
               that he would be referred to student conduct for allowing
               illegal activities to take place in his dorm room. I was unable
               to locate Abukweik and called several phone numbers I found for
               him. About 0000 hours on 01/13/14, Abukweik returned my call
               and agreed to meet with me on the 4th floor. I interviewed
               Abukweik in the 4th floor study lounge. I informed Abukweik
               that he was free to leave at any point and he was not being
               detained. I told Abukweik what I had already learned. Abukweik
               denied smoking in his room. When asked who was smoking Abukweik
               said he did not know. Abukweik said he came to WSU from
               California to get away from his "old vices" and had not smoked
               marijuana in a week. When I asked Abukweik questions he would
               not directly answer them rather he would dance around the
               question. Abukweik would not admit to smoking or know about the
               marijuana odor coming from his room. I told Abukweik that he
               would be referred to student conduct for his part in the
               situation. I am unable to determine who smoked the marijuana in
               the room. I only was able to determine that Hutchinson, Willis,
               and Abukweik were all in the room at the time odor was present.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 13th day of January, 2014, in
