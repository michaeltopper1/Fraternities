               at about 0815 hours Office Olmstead was dispatched to a 911
               call from a Public Access Telephone (PATS) at Southside Dining
               Center. I told him that I could respond as I was already in
               that area. I responded to Southside Dining. I walked inside the
               Dining Center and saw a man talking on the phone. His back was
               to me. I watched him for a few seconds and did not see anything
               that was out of the ordinary. It appeared that it was business
               as usual in the Dining Center. I cleared the scene. As I was
               leaving Whitcom told me that they were still on the phone with
               the subject and I needed to return. They also told me the
               subject was Aldhafiri, Fahad A. (06/01/94). I recognized his
               name from he contact with Pullman Police on Saturday, January
               11, 2013. I asked Officer Olmstead to respond to the building
               with me. I went back to Southside and contacted Aldhafiri. He
               said he saw something on the television and wanted to call his
               mother. Somehow he called 911 instead of his mother. He
               insisted that he did not need help. He provided me his WSU
               Cougar Card as identification. The Cougar Card indicated he was
               an IALC student. He also gave me a letter that granted him
               admission to WSU as a Chemical Engineering student. He told me
               his home country is the desert. He erased his countries border.
               I talked with Aldhafiri for about twenty (20) minutes. He was
               oriented to time, place, and who he was. He began to cry at
               times throughout the conversation. He told me that he had not
               slept last night and had smoked marijuana. Aldhafiri wanted to
               go watch TV. I do not believe Aldhafiri was not acting normal
               but he did not appear to be a danger to himself or anyone else
               at this point in time. After a lengthy unproductive
               conversation Officer Olmstead and I left Aldhafiri to watch
               television in the Dining Center. We contacted the Executive
               Chef at the Dining Center and let him know about our
               interaction with Aldhafiri. We asked that he call us back if
               Aldhafiri causes any problems. Vievu video was downloaded. No
               further investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 13th day of January,
               2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               13, 2014 at about 0955 hours WSU Police were dispatched to a
               report of a man on the roof of Bryan Hall. Officer Olmstead and
               I responded to the building. As we were en route I asked
               Whitcom to check with WSU Facilities Operations to see if there
               were workers on the roof. Facilities Operations did not have
               personnel working on the roof. We were given a description of a
               male wearing blue pants, crimson shirt, longer hair, looks
               middle eastern. The subject was dancing around yelling on the
               roof. The description of the male matched that of Aldhafiri,
               Fahad A. (06/01/94). Officer Olmstead and I had just contacted
               him in Southside Dining Center at around 0822 hours. I was the
               first officer to arrive on scene, Assistant Chief Hansen
               arrived just seconds after I did. I approached Bryan Hall from
               the Terrell Mall on the southeast corner of the building. I
               could see Aldhafiri walking down the fire escape stairs on the
               south side of the building. He was speaking incoherently. I
               yelled for him to come down the stairs, which he did. When he
               reached the ground I handcuffed him with his hands behind his
               back. I noticed he was very cold to the touch. According to the
               National Weather Service Pullman Regional Airport reporting
               station the temperature was about 43 degrees Fahrenheit. The
               wind was blowing west, southwest at 25 MPH with gusts of 40
               MPH. I asked him why he was on the roof. He told me that he was
               going to Bryan Hall. I asked him how long he had been out here.
               Aldhafiri replied "Days, years." When I told him he was in
               protective custody and going to go to the hospital he said
               "Thank You." I again asked him what he was doing on the roof.
               He said "Acting a scene, many scenes." He said the scene was
               called "Being a man...standing your ground just like Bob Dylan.
               Like a train. Like Johnny Cash." I asked him if he was trying
               to jump off the roof. He said no. Aldhafiri said he was on the
               edge of the roof. He went on to say "I was on the edge and it
               was windy. So windy like and I didn't train for ballet, or any
               dancing or tango or like flexible shit." He then said he
               watches Youtube videos that he creates in his head." I called
               the complainant, Langerveld, Tyler L. (07/02/92). He said he

               was still in the area and would come back to talk with me.
               Langerveld said he was walking by By ran Hall and could he
               Aldhafiri yelling from the roof top. Aldhafiri was walking down
               the sloped area of the roof to the edge. He was also walking
               along a narrow ridge cap area. He said it looked like he could
               have easily jumped or fallen from the roof. This roof area is
               approximately thirty (30) feet or more from the ground. I
               transported Aldhafiri to Pullman Regional Hospital. Assistant
               Chief Hansen went to the hospital with me. Aldhafiri was
               compliant at the hospital. Aldhafiri told me he had smoked
               "weed" and not slept last night. He did not appear to be acting
               normal. Aldhafiri's actions and words make be believe he is
               suffering from a mental disorder and presents an imminent
               likelihood of serious harm to himself. Assistant Chief Hansen
               filled out the Release of Adult Protective Custody form in
               accordance with RCW 71.05.150. Dr. Scott signed the form. A
               copy has been place in the case file. I learned that Aldhafiri
               has passport from Saudi Arabia. He was born in Kuwait.
               Aldhafiri was in the IALC program at WSU. He has been admitted
               to WSU as a student. Today is his first day as a WSU student.
               Aldhafiri is only registered for 2 credits and must have a
               total of 12 to be a full time student. As an international
               student he has 30 days from today to register for his 12
               credits. According to Aldhafiri, he lives at Gannon Hall 203
               with student from Russia named Polyanski, Krill. I was unable
               to make contact with Polyanski. Aldhafiri was left in the care
               and custody of Pullman Regional Hospital. WSU Counseling
               Services was notified of the incident by Assistant Chief
               Hansen. There are no criminal charges. Vievu video has been
               downloaded. No further investigation. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               13th day of January, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 01-13-2014 at about 1026 hrs I was
               dispatched to an agency assist for the Pullman Police
               Department (PPD). Dispatch advised that Sergeant Sorem had
               requested that a WSUPD officer assist him with a domestic
               dispute at 528 SW Summer Street. I arrived on scene and
               contacted Sergeant Sorem inside the residence. Sergeant Sorem
               was speaking with Manjishtha D. Desilva (DOB 07-13-1991) and
               Elricco T. Jones (DOB 08-18-1986) in the living room of the
               apartment. Sergeant Sorem requested that I speak with Desilva.
               I contacted Desilva and learned the following: Desilva has been
               involved in a dating relationship with Jones for the past 4
               years. Jones resides at the residence with Desilva, but Desilva
               is the only official occupant listed on the lease. Desilva
               stated that Jones has not been taking his medication and has a
               mental disorder. Desilva said that she was arguing with Jones,
               and he became angry. Desilva said that Jones starting throwing
               things around the living room of the apartment, including a
               lamp, Christmas tree, and table. I observed that the artificial
               Christmas tree was tipped over on the floor and at least one of
               the ornaments had been broken. I saw that one of the legs for
               the table had also been damaged, and the table was propped up
               on the floor. Desilva said that the table was her exclusive
               property and had been purchased by her for $300.00 at Shopko.
               Desilva said Jones did not assault her during the argument, and
               there had not been any physical contact between them. I did not
               observe any signs of physical injury on Desilva. Desilva said
               she was not concerned about the damaged property and did not
               want to press criminal charges. I provided Desilva with the
               domestic violence information packet and the PPD case number.
               Officer Bell arrived on scene and photographed the damaged
               property. I cleared the scene. For more information, see PPD
               case #14-P00289. No further action at this time. Olmstead/339 I

               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W0098 SYNOPSIS: The Regents Hall
               Residential Educational Director, Britteny L. Alspach (04-04-
               89), called Whitcom reporting one of her residents, Taylor M.

               not harassing Sheldon. WSU Residence Life is planning on

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 01-13-14, I responded to Regents Hall
               and met The Residential Educational Director, Britteny Alspach,
               in the lobby. She asked if we could go to the upper floor and
               talk. I followed her upstairs and we met with Taylor M. Sheldon
               and Fallon T. Burrow (05-24-95). Alspach informed me Sheldon
               wanted to report being harassed. I asked Sheldon to tell me
               what was going on. She explained she had been assaulted by
               Brianne Thompson at the end of the last semester of school
               before the Christmas break and said Thompson had been moved out
               of Regents Hall. She went on to explain she had gone to the
               court house in Pullman and filed for an order of protection
               from Thompson. She said she thought things would get better
               over the Christmas break and hoped things would be better this
               semester. She said at approximately 2140 hours on 01-12-14, she
               went to take a shower in the 4th floor bathroom near her room.
               She said she had been in the shower for approximately 10
               minutes when she felt as if someone was watching her. She
               looked around and could see Brianne Thompson standing near the
               sinks just staring at her. She said she turned the water off
               and grabbed her towel. She said she felt as if she stood there
               for a couple of minutes while Thompson just stared at her. She
               said Thompson left the bathroom area so she ran out of the
               bathroom and into her room, which is just across from the
               bathroom. I asked her if she saw where Thompson went after she
               left the bathroom and she said she did not even look to see
               where she was. She just wanted to get to her room. Sheldon said
               she did not feel scared, rather creaped out. She did not know
               if Brianne was going to attempt to assault her again or not,
               but felt very nervous. Sheldon said she and Fallon Burrow was
               in her room at approximately 1540 hours on 01-13-13 and Sheldon
               said she had her window open. Burrow told Sheldon she saw
               Thompson walking down the hallway so Sheldon asked Burrow to
               shut her door. The wind caught the door and slammed it shut.

               Sheldon and Burrow said they heard Thompson yell something to
               the effect of "Real Mature. That's Really Mature". They said
               Thompson continued yelling as she continued walking down the
               hall. Burrow and Sheldon said they feel Thompson was actually
               staying with a friend, Nichole (Nikki) Aviles, in 407 Regents
               Hall. I made contact with Aviles who said Thompson did stay
               with her in her room last night (01-12-13). I made sure she was
               aware of WSU's policy on having "Guests" stay in her room, even
               if she was a student. She said she thought she could have
               guests for up to three days. I told her that was correct. I
               told her she was allowed to have a guest for up to 3
               consecutive days and up to 10 total days in a calendar month. I
               also told her she should check with her hall staff to make sure
               Thompson was allowed to stay in Regents Hall as she had been
               moved out of the hall. She said she would check. I thanked her
               for her time. More to follow. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 13th day of

               NARRATIVE: On 01/13/14 at approximately 2216 hours, I responded
               to Stephenson North room 725, where RED, Brittany A. Griffin,
               was reporting the odor of marijuana coming from the room. Upon
               arrival I smell the door of room 725 and it smelled of
               marijuana. I knocked on the door for several minutes without
               anybody answering. It was clear that marijuana was present or
               recently present inside room 725. With the help of Griffin, it
               was determined that there was only one person assigned to room
               725, Kristopher Blake Nielsen 12/10/94. I found three phone
               numbers listed for Nielsen on Zzusis but only one worked. I
               left a message on Nielsen's phone but he did not return my
               call. I went back to Nielsen's room a bit later but again there
               was no answer when I knocked on the door. Due to Nielsen being
               the sole occupant of room 725 and the odor of marijuana being
               contained to room 725, I will be referring Nielsen to student
               conduct. Nielsen was contacted on 08/16/13 for possessing
               463.18 grams of marijuana. See case 13-W3315. Nothing further.
               I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 01/14/14 at approximately 0056 hours
               I was driving westbound on Colorado approaching the
               intersection of Colorado and B St. I came to a stop at the
               intersection while a white Chevy Caviler was heading eastbound
               on Colorado to the same intersection. The Caviler started to
               slow and I started my left hand turn onto B St. However the
               Caviler did not stop for the stop sign and stopped in the
               middle of the intersection just before hitting my patrol car. I
               stopped in the intersection and activated my VieVu camera. I
               walked up to the driver, later identified as Stephanie Cordova
               04/17/94, and told her to turn right onto B St and pull over.
               While talking to Cordova the driver's side rear passenger,
               later identified as Austin Robert Kanouse 10/24/94, was
               fumbling for his seatbelt to put it on. Cordova pulled over
               onto B St as instructed. I walked back up to Cordova's car and
               contacted Cordova. I identified myself, informed Cordova I was
               recording, and asked why she did not stop at the intersection.
               Cordova said she was in a rush. I asked for Cordova's driver's
               license which she provided. The driver's side rear passenger
               window was down and I asked Kanouse why he was not wearing his
               seatbelt. Kanouse said, "Sorry." Kanouse appeared to be very
               intoxicated and was having difficulty keeping his eyes open. I
               could smell the over powering odor of intoxicants coming from
               the vehicle. I asked Cordova if she had anything to drink
               tonight. Cordova replied, "no I'm a sober driver." I asked
               Cordova if she would provide a PBT sample and she said, "yea"
               but then quickly changed her answer stating that she had two
               beers at 1900 hours. I found my PBT (Alco-Sensor FST #16805) in
               working condition. Cordova provided a PBT sample of .051. I
               asked Cordova if she was willing to do some voluntary field
               sobriety tests and she said she would. During the HGN test I
               did not observe any signs of HGN. However during the HGN test,
               I could clearly smell the odor of intoxicants coming from her
               breath. During the Walk and Turn, Cordova stepped out of the
               starting position twice. Cordova missed heel to toe on steps 2

               and 4. Cordova also took 10 steps and stopped. I had to tell
               Cordova to turn around and take her remaining steps. During the
               one leg stand, Cordova raised her left leg and looked up from
               her foot several times. Cordova counted to 25 in the 30 seconds
               and never put her foot down. I asked Cordova if she would
               provide another PBT sample and she said she would. This time
               Cordova provided a PBT sample of .047. Based on Cordova's PBT
               numbers I decided not to arrest Cordova for MOMVACA but rather
               MIP Exhibiting. I told Cordova she was under arrest for MIP and
               handcuffed (D/L) her. Cordova was advised of her right to
               counsel and searched incident to arrest. No weapons or illegal
               items were found. I placed Cordova in the backseat of my patrol
               car while I contacted Kanouse. I asked Kanouse to speak with me
               on the sidewalk. Kanouse exited the car and was very uneasy on
               his feet. When walking around the back of the Caviler, Kanouse
               put his left hand down on the trunk to steady his balance. When
               Kanouse reached the sidewalk, he did not raise his foot high
               enough and tripped on the curbing. It was clear that Kanouse
               was very intoxicated. I asked Kanouse how much he had to drink.
               Kanouse said he had two shots. I asked Kanouse if he would be
               willing to provide a PBT sample and Kanouse said he would. I
               found my PBT again in working condition. Kanouse attempted to
               provide a PBT sample twice but he kept sucking through the
               straw instead of blowing out. The third attempt Kanouse blew
               outwards however I had to manually click the PBT early because
               Kanouse was not providing enough breath. Kanouse provided a
               weak PBT sample of .154. While Kanouse was standing in front of
               me I could clearly smell the overpowering odor of intoxicants
               coming from his breath. I told Kanouse that he was under arrest
               for MIP and handcuffed (D/L) him. While handcuffing Kanouse he
               kept tensing up his arms as if he was going to attempt to over
               come my control. Kanouse calmed down and I was able to place
               him in my patrol car without incident. I contacted the
               remaining passenger, Sakura Mamiya 10/11/94. I asked Mamiya how
               much she had to drink tonight and she said a beer and two
               shots. Mamiya said her last drink was about 30 minutes ago. I
               asked to check Mamiya's eyes and she said I could. During the
               HGN test I did not observe any signs of HGN. I also could not
               smell the odor of intoxicants on her breath. I told Mamiya that
               she was not going to be arrested for MIP Exhibiting however,
               she would be referred to student conduct for her alcohol
               consumption. Mamiya said she under stood and walked the rest of
               the way home to Coman Hall. With Cordova's permission, I parked
               her Caviler in the Chi Omega parking lot and secured the car. I
               transported Cordova and Kanouse to Pullman Holding Facility
               were each person was placed in a separate holding cell. Due to
               the time being around bar closing and the number of calls
               coming in I left Cordova and Kanouse in the holding facility
               until I had a free moment. At 0254 hours I returned to the
               Pullman Holding Facility where I fingerprinted and photographed
               Cordova without incident. I explained that I would be
               forwarding charges of MIP Exhibiting to the prosecutor. I also
               issued Cordova a Sector NOI for failure to stop at the stop
               sign. Cordova was released from custody. I next started to
               process Kanouse. The receptionist at the Holding Facility

               informed me that Kanouse had been vomiting a lot since I had
               left him. When I opened the cell door Kanouse was asleep on the
               bench and woke when I called his name. When Kanouse stood up he
               was very unsteady on his feet and appeared to be out of it. I
               had Kanouse sit down and because he appeared to be so
               intoxicated I turned on my VieVu camera again. I told Kanouse
               that he was being recorded again and asked him his date of
               birth. Kanouse said, "October 24, 1994." I asked who was the
               President of the United States. Kanouse replied, "Austin
               Kanouse." I asked Kanouse what State he was in currently and
               Kanouse said, "November." I again asked what state he was in
               and Kanouse said, "October." I told Kanouse that I needed to
               have medics evaluate him because he could not answer my
               questions correctly. Once medics arrived they asked him several
               similar question as I had. This time Kanouse was able to answer
               all the questions correctly and medics determined that Kanouse
               did not need medical treatment. I fingerprinted and
               photographed Kanouse without incident. I asked Kanouse if he
               played any sports for WSU. Kanouse said he is a WSU Football
               Player. Bob Minnix will be notified of Kanouse situation. I
               placed Kanouse back in a holding cell for him to sober up. At
               approximately 0600 hours I returned to Pullman Holding
               Facility. I explained to Kanouse that charges of MIP Exhibiting
               would be forwarded to the prosecutor. I also issued Kanouse a
               Sector NOI for failure to wear his seatbelt. Kanouse was
               released from custody. It is my wish that Cordova be charged
               with MIP Exhibiting instead of being placed in the deferral
               program. Cordova has been contacted 4 times in the last year.
               Her contacts have ranged from, Urinating in Public,
               Obstruction, Possession another's ID for misrepresentation of
               age, and consuming drugs. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               14th day of January, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               had consumed 3 shots of vodka before returning to her sorority.
               Smith later admitted to having consumed more than the three
               shots she had initially told the medics about, but then added
               she had returned to her dorm room after becoming sick and
               vomiting. After speaking with Pullman Ambulance personnel, who
