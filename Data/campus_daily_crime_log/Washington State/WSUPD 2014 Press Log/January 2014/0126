               POLICE DEPARTMENT ** COLLISION REPORT ** CASE #: 14-W0311
               SYNOPSIS: Joe M. Campero (DOB 01-01-1922) was involved in a
               non-injury vehicle collision. DRIVER 1: Joe M. Campero (DOB 01-
               01-1922) VEHICLE 1: tan, 1997 Ford Taurus (WA Lic. AGD1414)
               INSURANCE: State Farm / #2631823-D04-47F / exp. 04-04-2014
               DAMAGE: passenger side rear quarter panel scratched DAMAGE
               VALUE: $500.00 RO OF VEHICLE 2: Alfred C. Norton (DOB 05-28-
               1938) VEHICLE 2: white, 2010 Ford Explorer (WA Lic. 1969WSU)
               INSURANCE: n/a DAMAGE: driver side front quarter panel
               scratched DAMAGE VALUE: $500.00 WITNESS(ES): n/a NARRATIVE: On
               01-26-2014 at about 1503 hrs I was dispatched to a non-injury
               vehicle collision in the parking lot located on the north side
               of Beasley Coliseum, at 925 NE North Fairway Road. I arrived on
               scene and contacted Joe M. Campero (DOB 01-01-1922). Campero
               was the driver of a tan, 1997 Ford Taurus (WA Lic. AGD1414).
               There were no other passengers or witnesses. After speaking
               with Campero, I determined the following: Campero was backing
               up his vehicle in the parking lot and did not see another
               parked and unoccupied vehicle behind him. Campero continued to
               back up, and the passenger side rear quarter panel of his
               vehicle collided with the driver side front quarter panel of
               the parked and unoccupied vehicle. Campero did not complain of
               any injuries. The damage to the vehicles was consistent with
               the information provided by Campero. Campero's vehicle had been
               moved prior to my arrival. I photographed the vehicles, and the
               photographs were downloaded into Spillman. I gave Campero a
               verbal warning for unsafe backing. The parked and unoccupied
               vehicle was identified as a white, 2010 Ford Explorer (WA Lic.
               1969WSU). The registered owner of this vehicle was identified
               as Alfred C. Norton (DOB 05-28-1938). I contacted Norton on the
               telephone, and he responded to the scene. I provided him with
               Campero's contact and insurance information. No further action
               at this time. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this __27__ day of

               I was dispatched to a drugs call at Stevens Hall room 210. The
               RED on duty, Ross A. Mcclure, was reporting the odor of
               marijuana coming from room 210 in Stevens Hall. Upon arrival I
               knocked on door 210 and Rahmo Mohamed Ali 07/23/95 answered the
               door. Ali is the only person registered for room 210. I
               explained to Ali why I was called to her room. I explained that
               if she turned over all of her marijuana and smoking devices, we
               would go outside, destroy the items, and she would be referred
               to student conduct for smoking in her room. Ali opened the door
               a little more and I saw two other females sitting on the floor.
               Ali asked to talk it over with her friends. Ali talked to her
               two friends, later identified as Eden Kristos Medhane 03/02/95
               and Afrah E. Eltom 10/25/94. Ali said they decided to turn over
               their stuff. Ali showed me they had a small bag of marijuana
               that only contained on bud and a glass pipe they had used to
               smoke. We all went down to the dumpster where the items were
               destroyed. I explained the laws regarding marijuana to the
               three and told them they were free to go. Nothing further. I
