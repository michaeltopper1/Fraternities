               22-14 at about 1601 hours I was dispatched to the report of the
               odor of marijuana emitting from Duncan Dunn room 35. I
               responded to the area and could smell a very strong odor of
               marijuana in the hallway around rooms 35 and 39. I could not
               verify which room the odor of marijuana was emitting from. I
               was able to smell the odor of something burning at the door of
               room 35 though. I knocked on the door and a male answered,
               later identified as Christoper B. Sterling Jr. When he answered
               the door the odor became stronger but I could not determine
               what the odor was. I asked Sterling about it. He said that
               about 15 minutes ago they had a candle burning while they were
               playing with a ouija board. Sterling's roommate was identified
               as Matthew S. Elliot. I warned Sterling and Elliot about
               burning candles in their room. It did not appear to me as if
               Sterling or Elliot had used marijuana and I could not detect
               that odor emitting from them or their room. Unable to locate
               the origin of the original complaint for the odor of marijuana.
               I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W0248 SYNOPSIS: Brittney Hassett called

               NARRATIVE: On 01/22/14 at about 2034 hrs Dispatch advised of an
               individual wishing to report they found their stolen bicycle
               posted for sale online. I contacted the complainant, Brittney
               L. Hassett (032093), and she told me a friend of hers saw her
               stolen bike posted in the "Free & For Sale" group for WSU on
               Facebook. Hassett said the friend sent her a screen shot from
               her phone because Hassett does not have access to see the
               posting. Hassett described her bike as a green Raleigh mountain
               bike with White shocks. She said it was stolen at the end of
               spring semester last year (April/May 2013) but she never
               reported it. She said she never reported it because she
               suspected her ex-boyfriend, whom she had recently broken up
               with due to domestic violence issues, stole the bicycle. She
               said he refused to return several other items of her's she did
               not care to report as stolen due to low value. At the time
               Hassett was scared to report even the bicycle as stolen because
               she feared reprisal from her ex-boyfriend, Sam L. Ward
               (070792). The posting Hassett's friend saw was listed by Ward.
               Hassett did not have the serial number for the bicycle but said
               she would contact the bike shop she bought it from on 01/23/14
               and attempt to get a proof of purchase which may have the
               serial number on it. Hassett forwarded me the picture of the
               for sale posting by Ward, which shows a bicycle and biclcyle
               pump. The bicycle matches the description given by Hassett. I
               went to Orton Hall, the last known residence for Ward, and was
               unable to locate the bike in a bike rack. I checked the WSU
               computer system and found the Orton Hall address as "inactive"
               with no current physical address listed. More to follow. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 23 day of January, 2014, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer

               scene. I could not hear anything but faint music coming from
               apartment C3. I knocked on the door and a male answered,
               identified as Colby M. Corneau. He told me that he was cleaning
               his apartment and had music on. I asked if he was banging
               something or had dropped something. He said he was moving
               furniture to vacuum underneath it. I warned Corneau for the
               volume of his music. I made contact with the RP afterwards, per
               his request. I told him the residents were warned for noise.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
