               XXYES NO OTHER UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 012414, I learned that
               Alexis M. Jones had a warrant for her arrest out of Whitman
               County for Failure to Appear for a MIP charge. I checked for
               Jones in the WSU System and learned that she lives on WSU
               Campus. On 012814 at approximately 0916 hours, Ofc. Olmstead
               and I responded to her residence and knocked on the door. I
               heard someone inside the room speaking. A short time later, a
               female opened the door and identified herself as Jones. I
               explained to Jones that she had a warrant for her arrest and
               that she could get changed because I had to take her to Colfax.
               Jones told me I could hold the door open while she got ready to
               go. While she was getting ready, I asked dispatch to contact
               Whitman County Jail and confirm the warrant which they did.
               When Jones was finished getting shoes and a sweatshirt on, she
               walked out of her room and I placed her under arrest in the
               hallway. WSUPD Intern Michelle Thorgrimson handcuffed (DL)
               Jones and searched her person incident to arrest. I advised
               Jones of her Constitutional Rights and she told me she
               understood. Jones was transported to Whitman County Jail where
               I read her the warrant and turned her over to jail staff.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 28th day of January, 2014, in
