               2014 at about 1432 hrs I was dispatched to a report of a theft
               at the Flix Cafe, located at 1395 SE Stadium Way. I contacted
               the complainant, Justin M. Stoeckle (DOB 10-12-1994), on the
               telephone. Stoeckle stated that on 01-25-2014 at about 0100 hrs
               he was in the Flix Cafe and had his cellular telephone with
               him. Stoeckle said he left the cafe and later that same day at
               about 0500 hrs he realized that his cellular telephone was
               missing. Stoeckle believes that he left his cellular telephone
               in the Flix Cafe and someone took it. Stoeckle used Google
               Android Manager to track his telephone. According to the
               information provided by this application, Stoeckle's telephone
               was located in Clarkston, Washington. Stoeckle said he was not
               able to pinpoint the location of his telephone and explained
               that the area showing a signal from his telephone was over
               5,000 meters in size. Stoeckle said he would continue to
               monitor the location of his telephone, and I told him to
               contact me if he was able to provide a more accurate location.
               Stoeckle described his cellular telephone as: Make: Samsung
               Model: Galaxy Note 3 Serial #: unknown MAC Address: unknown
               Description: white in color Value: $300.00 Stoeckle said the
               service provider for his telephone is AT&T, and the number for
               his telephone is 360-870-1880. Stoeckle said he called his
               telephone several times, but it was not answered. Stoeckle said
               he used his cellular telephone on the WSU Wireless Internet
               Network and believed he last used it on the internet sometime
               on 01-24-2014. Stoeckle resides in Stephenson North and has a
               Dell computer that he also uses on the network. Stoeckle's WSU
               Network ID is: justin.stoeckle. Stoeckle's WSU Student ID
               Number is: 011383782. I will forward the information in this
               case to WSU Information Technology and request that they
               attempt to identify the MAC Address for Stoeckle's stolen
               cellular telephone and check for anyone using the telephone on
               the wireless internet network after it was stolen. No further
               action at this time. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under

               NARRATIVE: On 01/25/14 at approximately 2330 hours, I was
               driving westbound on Colorado St. near Vahalla's Tavern when I
               saw a male and female walking eastbound on Colorado. The female
               grabbed my attention because as she walked she was stumbling
               side to side even though the male had his arm over her
               shoulders. Both the male and female appeared to be under the
               age of 21. I drove around the block and by the time I found the
               two again they were on Colorado St. near the soccer field. They
               had now joined up with two other people. Ofc. Boyd radioed that
               he was going to contact the other two while I contacted the
               male and female I had originally seen. I contacted the group
               and asked them if they had a second to talk. All four stopped.
               I told the female, Holly M. Exner 12/02/94, that I had stopped
               to talk with her specifically. I told her about my observations
               and Exner said it was because of her heels. Exner was holding a
               pair of high heels in her hand and was barefoot while I spoke
               with her. While talking with Exner she was still swaying side
               to side and unable to stand still even though she was barefoot.
               Exner said it was because her feet were cold. I asked for
               Exner's ID and she provided her WSU Cougar Card. I asked Exner
               how old she was and she said 19 years old. As Exner stood
               before me I could smell the odor of intoxicants coming from her
               breath. Exner provided the rest of her information verbally. I
               asked Exner how much she had to drink to night and she said a
               little bit. I asked how much is a little bit and Exner said
               three mixed drinks. I asked Exner if I could check her eyes.
               Exner said I could and I performed an HGN test on her. During
               the test, I observed equal tracking, lack of smooth pursuit,
               and distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation. When
               I started the test I had Exner stand with her heels and toes
               touching. When Exner did this she started to lose her balance
               and almost stumbled into the roadway. I was able to grab Exner
               by her arm before she went into the road way. I asked Exner if
               she was willing to provide a PBT sample. Exner explained that
               her Criminal Justice professor had told her to refuse a PBT
               when an Officer asks. I told Exner that the PBT was voluntary
               and she did not have to take it. I told Exner that she was

               under arrest for MIP Exhibiting and handcuffed (D/L) her. I
               advised Exner of her right to counsel and placed her in the
               backseat of my patrol car. I contacted the male that Exner was
               walking with. The male did not appear to be intoxicated so I
               did not identify him. I told the male he was free to go or he
               could wait for Exner to be released. The male decided to stay.
               I researched Exner's name in Spillman and found no entries. I
               told Exner that because she had not been contacted for alcohol
               before, I would be forwarding charges of MIP Exhibiting to the
               prosecutor. Also this case would be referred to student
               conduct. Exner stated she understood. I released Exner from
               custody and she and the male walked toward Regents Hall.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 27th day of January, 2014, in

               at about 2337 hrs I was driving eastbound on Colorado St.
               passing WSU Parking Services when I noticed a male and female
               who were walking eastbound in front of parking services. They
               caught my attention because they both appeared to be under the
               age of 21 and both were stumbling side to side as they walked.
               I stopped to contact them at about the same time Officer
               Westerman stopped to contact two other subjects at the same
               location, near the Lower Soccer Field (14-W0300). I asked the
               subjects I saw walking, later identified as Sloan C. Jackowich
               and Keenan W. Williams, I asked how much they had to drink and
               they both denied having consumed any alcohol. I asked if I
               could check their eyes to make sure they had not been drinking
               and they both agreed. I administered a horizontal gaze
               nystagmus test on Jackowich and observed she had bloodshot and
               watery eyes, a lack of smooth pursuit, and a distinct and
               sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes. I could
               smell the odor of intoxicants on her breath as I administered
               the test. I administered a horizontal gaze nystagmus test on
               Williams and observed he had bloodshot and watery eyes, a lack
               of smooth pursuit, and a distinct and sustained nystagmus at
               maximum deviation in both eyes. I could smell the odor of
               intoxicants on his breath as I administered the test. I asked
               them both for their ID's. They each provided their Washington
               driver's licenses, which confirmed they were both under 21. I
               advised them both I would be forwarding charges to the Whitman
               County Prosecutor for MIP Exhibiting and they were released.

               NARRATIVE: On 01/26/14 at about 0151 hrs I was driving
               eastbound on Colorado St. past the Lower Soccer Field when I
               noticed a male, later identified as Zachary F. Griffith
               (071694), who was walking eastbound along Colorado St. Griffith
               caught my attention because he appeared to be under the age of
               21 and was having difficulty walking, stumbling side to side as
               he walked. I stopped and contacted Griffith as he reached the
               corner of the Scott Coman parking lot. I asked how much he had
               to drink and he initially denied consuming alcohol but later
               admitted to having had "2 beers". I asked if I could check he
               eyes and he agreed. I administered a horizontal gaze nystagmus
               test on him and observed he had bloodshot and watery eyes, a
               lack of smooth pursuit, and a distinct and sustained nystagmus
               at maximum deviation. Griffith swayed front to back during the
               test and I could smell the odor of intoxicants on his breath as
               I administered the test. I asked Griffith for his ID and he
               provided me with his Washington driver's license, which
               confirmed he was under the age of 21. I advised Griffith I
               would be forwarding charges for MIP Exhibiting to the
               prosecutor's office. Nothing further. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of

               Ofc. Boyd informed me that he had seen two females walking on
               Spokane St. and they appeared to be intoxicated. Ofc. Boyd was
               trying to turn around when I found the two he described. Both
               females were sharing a blanket and walking southbound on
               Spokane St. near Columbia St. I contacted the two and asked if
               they had second to talk. The two stopped and I explained the
               reason that I was talking to them was because they appeared to
               be intoxicated. I explained the manner that they had been seen
               walking. Both females said it was because of their blanket.
               Both females identified themselves verbally. The females
               identified themselves as Manjot Kaur 04/23/95 and Gaberielle
               Jordan Weiler 05/24/95. Both females said they had not had any
               alcohol to drink. I asked the two if I could check their eyes.
               I checked both females but did not observe any signs of HGN. I
               again asked the two about their alcohol consumption. Kaur said
               she had two glasses of wine about two hours ago. When I asked
               Weiler she said she also had two glasses of wine. I told the
               two that they were not at the level that I would arrest someone
               for MIP. However I would be referring our contact to student
               conduct for their alcohol consumption. Both were told that they
               needed to go home. I started to get back into my car when Kaur
               asked what gave me the right to stop them. Ofc. Boyd and I
               explained that based on the way they were walking and that they
               appeared to be under the age of 21, that gave us reasonable
               suspicion for MIP. Kaur said she was not doing anything wrong
               when I stopped her. It was clear that Kaur was not getting what
               I was telling her. I again said she was under the age of 21, in
               public, and after consuming alcohol. I explained that those
               three things make up the crime of MIP and that I had decided
               not to arrest them for it. Kaur said ok and left. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 27th day of January, 2014, in Pullman,

               approximately 0239 hours, Ofc. Boyd and I responded to a
               suspicious call at McEachern Hall South room 107. Dispatch
               stated a male had punched a window at room 107 and walked off.
               The male was described as wearing a beanie, red jacket, and
               workout style clothing. Dispatch stated he was last seen
               walking south towards the magic forest. I responded to the area
               of Stephenson and got out on foot. I found a group of about 7
               people and asked them if they had seen the male that was
               described. None of them had seen the male and none had any cuts
               to their hands. About this time dispatch stated someone had
               located the male at Flix Cafe and he was bleeding. I responded
               to the area and found the male on the steps that lead to the
               entrance to Flix. The male, later identified as Jonah Ulysses
               Simental 03/20/94, was bleeding heavily from his right hand.
               Simental also had blood all over his clothing and shoes. I told
               Simental to sit down and he did so. I could see several
               lacerations to the side and back of Simental's hand even though
               it was completely covered in blood. I also noticed a small
               clear plastic container about 6 feet away from Simental on the
               ground. I later looked at the container as it sat on the ground
               and saw several prescription bottles without labels. Inside the
               prescription bottles was marijuana. There also was a pipe
               inside the container. The container had blood on it. I asked
               Simental what happened. Simental said he was walking to his
               dorm and could not find his keys. When he reached his dorm his
               hand "was fucking bleeding." Simental said he lost his keys. I
               asked what dorm was his and he stated McEachern. I asked what
               room was Simental and he said, "S207." I asked Simental how he
               cut his hand. Simental said, "I wish I could tell you."
               Simental said, "It must have just happened during a long night
               in Pullman." I asked Simental if he had his ID and he said it
               was in his pocket. When I reached down to get his ID,
               Simental's hand started to spurt blood. Simental's hand was

               spurting blood about a foot into the air. I told Simental to
               put his other hand over the top of his right hand and apply
               pressure. Simental did so. I found Simental WADL in his wallet
               that he had pointed to. Ofc. Boyd looked at Simental's hand and
               Simental again said he does not know how he cut his hand. Ofc.
               Boyd told Simental that he believed he knew what happened. I
               told Simental that someone had watched him punch a window and
               that's how he cut his hand. Simental replied, "yeah but if I
               punched the window I would be in there" (his room). I asked
               Simental when I go up to room 107 and find his blood on the
               window, why would it be there. Simental began to answer but
               took his uninjured hand off his cut hand and he again began to
               squirt blood everywhere. Worried about Simental's health I
               stopped asking questions. Intern Bonjukian ran to my patrol car
               and grabbed the medical supplies out of the trunk. Ofc. Boyd
               applied gauze to Simental's hand to help with the bleeding.
               Ofc. Boyd stated he could smell the very strong odor of
               intoxicants coming from Simental breath. Medics arrived shortly
               thereafter and took Simental to Pullman Regional Hospital for
               treatment. Ofc. Boyd stayed at Flix to deal with the blood and
               collected the plastic container of marijuana as evidence. I saw
               several people standing off to the side of Flix watching the
               medics tend to Simental. I walked over to them and asked if
               anybody had seen anything. One female, Alexandra E. Kelly
               08/14/88, said she is the manager of Flix. Kelly had just
               locked up the building and was walking to her car when she saw
               Simental walking from the area of McEachern toward Flix.
               Simental was running his cut hand through the bushes as he
               walked towards Flix. Kelly saw Simental holding a small bag
               (same bag as recovered) in his hand and watched him drop it on
               the ground. Kelly contacted Simental but he begged her not to
               call the Police. Kelly called any ways. I thanked Kelly for her
               time and let her leave. I responded to room 107 and met with
               the reporting party, Hannah J. Campbell 08/24/92, who was the
               RED on duty at the time of the incident. Campbell was standing
               outside of room 107 and I saw the large front window of unit
               107 shattered. The window was double paned and only the outside
               pane of glass was broken. I could see what appeared to be
               knuckle marks in blood on the inside pane of glass that was
               still intact. There was a large amount of pooled blood on the
               ground near the glass. I asked Campbell what happened. Campbell
               said she had received two noise complaints at McEachern about a
               male yelling outside and a large crashing noise. When Campbell
               arrived at McEachern she saw Simental and his hand was bloody.
               Kelly asked Simental if he needed medical attention and
               Simental said no and walked away from Kelly towards Olympia
               Ave. At that point Kelly called 911. The RA for McEachern, not
               identified, was also on scene. The RA had the room assignment
               list with him and was able to tell me that Simental was listed
               as the occupant for room 107. I noticed two other males
               standing with Kelly. The males were identified as Connor M.
               Scott 05/24/95 and Brandon J. Heeney 04/07/94. Both had
               witnessed Simental break with window from room 533 in Gannon
               Hall. Heeney said he was studying with Scott in room 533 of
               Gannon Hall when they heard someone yelling near McEachern

               Hall. Heeney saw Simental throw something at the window and
               heard a crash noise. Simental then punched the window after
               that. Scott said he saw the same thing. I asked Scott if he
               could hear what Simental was saying. Scott said most of it was
               gibberish. Scott was able to hear Simental yell, "suck my dick
               you fucking faggot." It was believed Simental said that to the
               window. I asked Scott to describe the male he saw. Scott said
               Simental was wearing a baggy sweatshirt. Heeney said he
               believed the sweatshirt was red. I provided Kelly with the case
               number and my information. Ofc. Boyd contacted FacOps for clean
               up of the blood. Ofc. Boyd also followed the blood trail that
               led from McEachern room 107, around campus, and back to
               Simental at Flix. It was clear that Simental was responsible
               for the window at his room, 107. See Ofc. Boyd's supplement for
               full details on the trail of blood. Later at the station the

               hrs Pullman PD requested an agency assist outside the taco
               stand at Adams Mall for a fight. Officer Westerman and I
               responded. I assisted in detaining Richard D. Rush (030887),
               who was not listening to Officer Westerman's commands to step
               back from another suspect who was being detained by Officer
               Gordon. Rush was placed in handcuffs (double locked) and
               advised he was only being detained until we could determine
               what involvement, if any, he had in the fight. Pullman PD
               Officers investigated the fight and afterward came and released
               Rush. Nothing further. NAME/DOB: CITE/SECTOR#: OFFENSE:
