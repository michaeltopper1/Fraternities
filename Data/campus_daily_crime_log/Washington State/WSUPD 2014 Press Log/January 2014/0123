               WSU STUDENT: ____YES ____NO OTHER UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On
               01/23/14 at approximately 1355 hours I was dispatched to the
               electrical engineering for a theft. The reporting party stated
               an Ultrasonic Bath was taken from a lab. I met the reporting
               party, Thomas Garrison, and he walked with me to ETRL room 326.
               Garrison explained that his research group obtained the room
               for use in September. Garrison said they are still moving items
               into the room. Garrison said that there are two exterior doors
               leading into the room. Garrison explained that he normally uses
               only one of the doors to enter the lab. Garrison said he
               discovered that the other door had been unlocked. We went into
               the lab, which contained only several items and did not appear
               to be fully functional. Garrison showed me that an adjoining
               lab shares an interior door with his lab and it does not lock.
               I asked Garrison if he suspected the item was taken by a person
               for resale or "acquired" by another lab for use. Garrison said
               he had asked around to other labs and they did not have it so
               he suspected someone took it for resale. Garrison described the
               ultrasonic bath as being about the size of a small microwave
               oven and weighing approximately 30 pounds. Garrison said the
               bath was grey in color and cost $320. Garrison did not have a
               serial number for the item. Garrison said his group last used
               the bath on 01/06/14 and discovered it missing on 01/16/14.
               Garrison did not have any suspects in mind. I provided Garrison
               with my business card and case number as well as how to obtain
               the case through public records. I gave Garrison some tips on
               keeping his lab secured and suggested he contact the building
               coordinator to determine if they could lock the interior door.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 24th day of January, 2014, in

               NARRATIVE: On 01/23/14 at about 2233 hrs I was driving up
               Observation Dr. when I noticed a vehicle at the end of the road
               near the turn around. The vehicle's driver's door was open and
               a male, later idetnfied as Alexander R. Vaith (031094) was
               entering the vehicle. There were no other passengers in the cab
               of the vehicle. As I came around the turn around and my
               headlights illuminated the bed of the pickup I could see four
               individuals (later identified as Elisa C. Sallee (031395), Ryan
               t. Burnham (123194), Maxwell R. Burnham (123194), and Jay L.
               Parker (051295)) laying in the bed of the pickup. I initiated a
               traffic stop on the vehicle, turning on my overhead lights. The
               vehicle stopped by the power substaion on Observation Dr. I
               contacted Vaith and told him the stop was being recored. I
               explained to him that if there were available seatbelts in the
               vehicle they had to be occupied. I asked for Vaith's driver's
               license, vehicle registration, and insurance. Vaith provided
               the requested information. I returned to my patrol car and ran
               Vaith through Dispatch. I contacted Vaith again and as I was
               warning him for the seatbelt violations I noticed his eyes were
               extremely bloodshot and watery. I asked him to step out of the
               vehicle so I could speak with him. I told Vaith based on what I
               could see in his eyes they had either been drinking or smoking
               marijuana. I asked him which it was and he admitted they were
               smoking marijuana. Vaith said he had only one hit. I asked
               Vaith if he was willing to perform some field sobriety tests so
               I could make sure he was not impaired and he agreed. I had
               Vaith move to the pavement directly behind my patrol car. The
               area chosen was straight and level. Vaith was wearing tennis
               shoes, jeans, a sweatshirt, and a coat. The approximate
               temperature was approximately 28 degrees. I told Vaith I would
               be evaluating him based on how well he followed my instructions
               as well as how he performed on the tests. Vaith said he
               understood. The first test I administered was the horizontal

               gaze nystagmus test. I told Vaith to stand with his feet
               together and his arms at his sides. I told him to follow the
               tip of my pen with his eyes only and not to turn his head.
               Vaith said he understood. I held my pen approximately 12-15
               inches from Vaith's face, slightly above eye level. I confirmed
               Vaith's pupils were of equal size and his eyes tracked equally.
               During the test I observed Vaith had bloodshot and watery eyes.
               Vaith had a lack of convergence in his left eye. I had to
               remind Vaith to follow my pen with his eyes once during the
               test. The second test I administered was the nine step walk and
               turn. I told Vaith to imagine a straight line on the pavement.
               I told him to place his left foot on the line and to put his
               right foot on the line touching heel to toe with his left. I
               told him to keep his arms at his sides and to remain in this
               position while I explained the rest of the test. I told him not
               to start the test until instructed to do so. Vaith said he
               understood. I told Vaith to take nine steps, touching heel to
               toe, down the imaginary straight line. I told him to look at
               his feet the entire time and to count his steps out loud. I
               told Vaith to keep his arms at his sides. I told him once he
               reached his ninth step to leave his front foot in place and to
               take a series of small steps with his back foot to turn around.
               I told Vaith to take nine more steps back down the same
               imagainary straight line. I told him it was a continuous test
               and once he started not to stop. I reminded Vaith to touch each
               step heel to toe, count each step out loud, look at his feet
               the entire time, and to keep his arms at his sides. I
               demonstrated the test and Vaith said he understood my
               instructions. During the test Vaith failed to turn properly,
               turning to his righta and moving both feet in a series of small
               steps. Due to his improper turn Vaith started his second nine
               steps with his left foot in front of his right. The third test
               I administered was the one leg stand. I told Vaith to stand
               with his feet together and his arms at his sides. I told him to
               remain in this postion and not to start the test until
               instructed to do so. He said he understood. I told Vaith when
               instructed to begin to choose one foot, whichever he felt most
               comfortable with. I told him to raise that foot so his toe was
               approximately six inches off the ground. I told him to point
               his toe and to keep both legs straight. I told him to keep his
               arms at his sides, look at his toe, and count out loud by
               1000's (1001, 1002, 1003, and so on) until instructed to stop.
               I told him if at any point in time his foot touched the ground
               to pick it right back up and continue where he left off. I
               demonstrated the test and Vaith said he understood my
               instructions. Vaith chose to stand on his right foot, raising
               his left. Vaith started counting 1, 2, before chainging to
               counting 1-1000, 2-2000, 3-1000, and so on. Vaith raised his
               arms for balance and put his foot down on his count of 3-1000.
               On his count of 5-1000 he raised his arms for balance, began
               leaning/falling to his left, and put his foot down. Vaith
               picked his foot up and began counting again at 1-1000. Vaith
               counted to 13-1000 in 30 seconds. The fourth test I
               administered was the Rhomberg balance test. I told Vaith to
               stand with his feet together and his arms at his sides. I told

               him when instructed to begin to close his eyes, tilt his head
               back, and estimate the passage of 30 seconds. I told him I did
               not care how he estimated the passage of time but to do it in
               his head and not to count out loud. I told him once he believed
               30 seconds had passed to open his eyes, tilt his head forward,
               and say stop. I demonstrated the test and Vaith said he
               understood my instructions. During the test I observed Vaith
               had eyelid and body tremors. His corotid artery was visibly
               pulsing in his neck. Vaith swayed front to back during the
               test. At 31 seconds Vaith brought his head forward, opened his
               eyes, and said, "That's 30 seconds". At this time it was my
               opinion that Vaith's ability to operate a motor vehicle was
               impaired by marijuana. I told Vaith he was under arrest for DUI
               and placed him in handcuffs (double locked). I advised Vaith of
               his right to remain silent and his right to an attorney. I
               placed Vaith in my patrol car where I read him his
               Constitutional Rights, which he verbally waived. Vaith admitted
               again to smoking marijuana, saying he had one hit. He said he
               did not have any marijuana left in the vehicle. I returned to
               the vehicle and contacted Vaith's passengers. As I was doing so
               I could see a small multicolored glass bong and a mason jar
               containing what I recognized to be marijuana. Both were laying
               in the bed of the pickup where all four passengers had
               initially been sitting. Lee and Sallee had moved to the cab of
               the pickup while I was initially running Vaith's driver's
               information through Dispatch. I asked for all their ID's, which
               they provided. All of them indicated the subjects were under
               21. I told them it was clear what had been going on and that I
               could see the marijuana and bong in the bed of the pickup. I
               asked if they would cooperate and be honest with me, telling me
               who the marijuana belonged to. They all admitted the marijuana
               was owned collectively and they had all been smoking. I asked
               them to give me the marijuana and they did so. The provided me
               with the mason jar which contained marijuana, a small plastic
               container containing marijuana, a plastic bag containing
               marijuana, a large plastic bong containing marijuana in the
               bowl, and the small multicolored glass bong containing burnt
               marijuana residue. I thanked them for their cooperation and
               advised them I would be forwarding charges to the prosecutor on
               all of them for possession of marijuana. Corporal Edwards
               remained on scene to wait for the vehicle tow. I transported
               Vaith to the Pullman PD holding facility. Upon arrival at the
               holding facility I read Vaith his Constitutional Rights from
               the DUI packet. He signed stating they were read to him and
               also that he was waiving his rights. I read Vaith the Implied
               Consent warning for breath at 2304 hrs and he signed stating it
               was read to him. I told him I was not going to ask him for a
               breath sample because I believed his ablity to drive was
               impaired by marijuana and not alcohol. I told him I read him
               the warnings so he was aware of the leagle TCH content limits
               for DUI. I told Vaith I was going to ask him to submit to a
               voluntary blood draw. I told him he had the right to refuse the
               blood draw and require I obtain a search warrant for his blood.
               Vaith said he would consent to the blood draw. I read Vaith the
               voluntary blooddraw consent form from the DUI packet and he

               said again he would consent to the blood draw. I placed Vaith
               in a holding cell and requested Dispatch have the Pullman
               Ambulance dispatched for the blood draw. The ambulance arrived
               and I brought Vaith back out of the holding cell. I asked him
               if he would like me to read the voluntary blood draw warnings
               again and he said no. He signed the consent form for the
               voluntary blood draw in the presence of the ambulance
               personnel. I observed as EMT Tadema swabbed the crook of Vaiths
               right arm with an iodine solution. I observed her draw blood
               from the crook of his right arm into the two grey topped vials
               which I provided. I took possession of the vials and labeled
               them. I provided Tadema and Vaith with copies of the completed
               voluntary blood draw form. I also provided Vaith with his
               notice of right to hearing form. I placed Vaith back in a
               holding cell while I went to complete paperwork. I later
               returned and explained to Vaith I would be forwarding charges
               to the prosecutor for possession of marijuana as well as DUI
               pending the lab results. Vaith was released. After returning to
               the WSU Police station where I processed the items seized as
               evidence. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 24 day of January,
               2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               hours I was advised of a drug call at Stephenson North room
               317. I was busy with another call and could not respond for
               about 20 minutes. The report was from the hall director,
               Jenafer Doolittle, who advised that she could smell the odor of
               marijuan emitting from room 317. When I arrived I could not
               smell the odor of marijuana in the hallway or at the room. I
               knocked but nobody answered. I left. About 10 minutes later I
               was called back to room 317. Doolittle had called stating that
               one of the residents was now home and wanted to talk to me. I
               responded and contacted Eric J. Harper. Harper wanted to know
               what was going to happen to him. I told him nothing at this
               point. When he opened the door I could smell a very faint odor
               of burnt marijuana. I could also smell the odor of alcohol from
               Harper's breath as he spoke. I could see his eyes were
               bloodshot and watery. I asked Harper if he had done anything
               today as far as drug or alcohol consumption. He said that he
               drank alcohol at about 3pm. He told me that he did not smoke
               marijuana and said I could test his hair if I wanted to. I told
               Harper I did not want to do that and warned him about his
               alcohol consumption. Nothing further. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               dispatched to a suspicious circumstance at Sloan Hall. Whitcom
               advised that a custodian was requesting assistance with

               in. I responded and contacted two males, identified as William

               not be let into the building. I asked them if they had keys and
               they both said no, but that they had been told Sloan Hall was
               open 24 hours a day. I explained to Ali and Van Hoff that some
