               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On January 11, 2014 at about 0901 hours
               I contacted Alabdulelah, Mohammad R. A. A. M. (02/06/88)
               outside of the WSU Police Department. Alabdulelah told me that
               he has been out of the country since December 14, 2013. He left
               his motorcycle, 5C7530/WA, parked under Owen Science Library
               but it is not there now. He did not give anyone permission to
               take or use the motorcycle. The motorcycle is described as a
               blue 2013 Kawasaki EX650. The common model name for this
               motorcycle is the Kawasaki Ninja. The motorcycle has ABS. It is
               valued at $8000.00. Alabdulelah had a copy of his vehicle
               registration with him. I had Whitcom check the vehicle
               registration. I was told that the vehicle is not listed as
               stolen. Whitcom also told me that the City of Pullman
               Parking/Code Enforcement has been attempting to contact
               Alabdulelah regarding an abandoned motorcycle located at the
               Pullman City Playfields off of Riverview. There were no
               Parking/Code Enforcement officers in service at the time of
               call. According to the Pullman Police call, the motorcycle was
               reported as an abandoned vehicle on January 1, 2014. The
               complainant reported the vehicle had been there for over a
               week. I verified Alabdulelah's identification via his State of
               Washington Driver's License. He is listed as the registered
               owner of the motorcycle. I transported Alabdulelah to the
               Pullman City Playfields. We located his motorcycle parked in a
               legal parking space. Alabdulelah started the motorcycle with
               his key. The motorcycle handle bars were not locked. He looked
               at the motorcycle for damage. I saw scrapes on both side of the
               motorcycle. I also noticed the front brake and clutch levers
               had broken ends on them. The damage is consistent with the
               motorcycle being laid on it's side. Alabdulelah said he wrecked
               the motorcycle a few times. He said the damage was done by him.
               The digital odometer had a reading of 522 miles. Alabdulelah
               said that is the correct amount of mileage. He said the
               motorcycle looks to be in tact and nothing wrong with it. The
               motorcycle fuel gauge showed it was almost empty. Alabdulelah
               told me he left it with an almost empty tank of fuel. While on
               scene at the City Playfields, Pullman Police Officer Heroff

               contacted me. I explained to him what happened and asked if he
               wanted a case number because the motorcycle was found in
               Pullman Police area. He said "no" and left the scene a short
               time later. I believe the most plausible explanation of how the
               motorcycle ended up at the City Playfields is this. A person or
               persons put the motorcycle in neutral and rode it down the
               steep College Avenue hill from Owen Science Library. The
               motorcycle coasted down the hill to the City Playfields parking
               lot. I transported Alabdulelah back to his vehicle near French
               Administration. He was going to go home and get his helmet so
               he can move the motorcycle. Alabdulelah was going to park his
               motorcycle in the Fine Arts Parking Garage. He has a valid WSU
               Motorcycle permit. It is unknown who took the motorcycle or
               when it was taken. No further investigation. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               12th day of January, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               11-2014 at about 1935 hrs I was dispatched to a report of the
               odor of marijuana originating from Goldsworthy Hall #635,
               located at 1455 SE Stadium Way. Dispatch advised that the
               complainant, Brittany A. Griffin (DOB 07-26-1989), had reported
               the odor of burning marijuana originating from the room.
               Griffin is the hall director for Stephenson South. Officer
               Jones and I arrived on scene, and I contacted Griffin in the
               hallway. Griffin confirmed that she had detected the odor of
               burning marijuana originating from room #635. While standing in
               the hallway, I could detect the odor of burning marijuana, and
               the odor became stronger when I placed my nose to the crack of
               the door to room #635. I knocked on the door and contacted two
               individuals inside the room, who were identified as Emily S.
               Halvorson (DOB 12-11-1994) and Gilian H. Fejes (DOB 10-28-
               1993). Halvorson is a WSU student and is the resident of
               Goldsworthy Hall #635. Fejes is a WSU student and resides at
               Goldsworthy Hall #603. Halvorson is 19 years old, and Fejes is
               20 years old. Upon further investigation, I determined the
               following: Halvorson and Fejes were in possession of a plastic
               bag containing a small amount of green vegetable material
               (GVM). The GVM inside the bag appeared to be marijuana and
               smelled like fresh marijuana. Halvorson and Fejes both claimed
               ownership of the GVM and told me they would take equal
               responsibility for it. Halvorson and Fejes both admitted to
               smoking marijuana inside the room earlier that evening.
               Halvorson and Fejes said they used a pipe to smoke marijuana
               inside the room. Halvorson and Fejes were cooperative. I
               explained to them that because they had been cooperative, I
               would not be taking any enforcement action. Halvorson agreed to
               voluntarily dispose of the GVM in the nearby restroom toilet,
               which she did. Officer Jones and I cleared the scene. No
               further action at this time. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               T87. Dispatch stated, Michael A. Baldwin 05/19/57, wanted a
               welfare check on his son, Stephen A. Baldwin 03/02/92. Michael
               said he was talking to his son on the phone while Steven was at
               Winco shopping in Moscow, ID. While on the phone, Steven's
               phone died. Michael tried calling Steven for about two hours
               but Steven would not answer. Michael provided Steven's address
               as Chinook Village, unit T87. Upon arrival I knocked on T87 and
               a female answered the door. I asked if Steven lived her and she
               said yes. Steven came to the door and I explained why I was at
               his apartment. Steven said his cell phone had died and had not
               called his dad back. Steven provided his WADL and I confirmed
               Steven's identity. I recommended that he give his dad a call
               and cleared. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 12th day of
               January, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               lovsted IV. They were the only residents present at the time as
               both residents of 509B were not home. I told Khatib and lovsted
               they had two options. I told them the could go retrieve their

               was to require I obtain a search warrant. I told them I would
               seize their room and they would be free to go. I told them I
               would apply for a search warrant, which may or may not be
               granted. I told them if the warrant was granted I would search
               the room and whatever was found would be dealt with through
               student conduct and the courts. Khatib and lovsted chose to
               retrieve their marijuana from the room. They came out with a
               small tupperware container with marijuana inside. I followed
               them outside and had them destroy the marijuana. Incident to be

               Gorrie took me to the bulletin board that was labeled "Walk of
               Awareness." On the board were several foot prints with messages
               printed on them. Three of the foot prints had writing next to
               them that was not nice. The first foot print said, "Only 22
               women curently serve as a CEO for one of the fourtune 500
               complanies." Someone wrote in sharpie marker next to the

               next footprint said, "17 states have legalized same-sex
               marriage." The person wrote, "too damn many." The final foot
               print said, "almost 2/3 of rapes were completed by someone

               for it." Gorrie and the RA of the floor did not know who wrote
               the messages and had no suspects. I took photos of the bulletin
