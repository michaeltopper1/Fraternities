               Dining reported a small fuel can with diesel located by a
               window in the south stairwell of Rogers Hall. It was determined
               to be placed in the stairwell by a resident because of the
               odor. NAME/DOB: CITE/SECTOR#: OFFENSE: REFERRALS: ____PA

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 011614 at about 0750hrs I contacted
               Mike Burt with WSU Housing and Dining Maintenance. Burt said
               that one of his troubleshooters was called to Rogers Hall last
               night because a fuel can was found in one of the stairwells.
               Burt did not have any additional information but said that he
               would call me with more later. Burt showed me the fuel can and
               I took photos of the can. The can was in a white plastic Wal-
               Mart bag and it was a 1-2 gallon red can. The can was almost
               full of diesel. I left the can with Burt. I went to Rogers Hall
               and spoke to the RA on duty, Vanessa Beck. Beck told me that at
               about 1845hrs last night, a resident on the second floor came
               to her and said that the south stairwell smelled like the odor
               of fuel. Beck checked the stairwell and could smell the odor.
               She then called the Hall Director, Christina Gilmore. Beck went
               to the 12th floor to look for the source of the odor while
               Gilmore located the source, a small red can filled with diesel,
               between the second and third floor in the south stairwell. The
               can was next to the window as if to help vent the fumes.
               Gilmore was told to call the Housing Troubleshooters which she
               did and they took the can back to their shop on Grimes Way.
               Gilmore told me that she has located a female resident who owns
               the can. The resident put the can in the stairwell because of
               the fumes. Gilmore did not know the resident's name but will
               email the information later this morning. I told Gilmore that I
               wanted to talk to the resident and discuss safety and fuel
               storage issues. I have not heard from Christina Gilmore who has
               the name of the resident who owns the fuel can. I have called
               and left a message at 1241hrs with no reply. I will try again
               later. At 1540hrs, I received an email from Gilmore who
               indicated the owner of the fuel can was Brenda Carbajal, who
               lives in Rogers Hall 334. I called Carbajal and she indicated
               that her friend Jennifer Castro (Roger Hall 326)and her went to
               Wal-Mart to purchase a fuel can to put fuel in Castro's
               vehicle. Carbajal said it was Castro's fuel can and they were
               told they could put the can in the stairwell. I told her that
               storage of fuel was not permitted in the rooms or buildings.

               approximately 0821 hours, I was dispatched to contact Jamie E.
               Marks regarding a harassment complaint. Upon contact, Marks
               told me the following. On 011514, some of her residents on the
               1st floor of Perham Hall told her that someone wrote on the 1st
               floor Perham Hall bulletin board, "I love black cock" and "I
               want a new RA." Marks told me that she is the RA of the 1st
               floor and her residents took the statements down prior to her
               seeing it. She stated she told her hall director about it and
               was told to monitor the problem and report it if it occurred
               again. Marks told me that on 011614 at approximately 0000
               hours, she checked the bulletin board and there was no damage
               to it. At approximately 0600 hours, she checked it again and
               there was more vulgar remarks on it. The remarks stated, "Still
               love black cock," "Suck my left clit or my right whatever works
               best for you," "Bitch!" and "Still want a new RA Bitch!" Marks
               told me she took pictures of the statements and then removed
               the graffiti from the bulletin board. Marks told me she just
               started this semester as an RA and has no idea who may have
               written the statements. She told me she was going to speak with
               her hall director later today. I advised her that I would speak
               with her hall director and we could discuss possible solutions
               to the problem. Case inactive pending further leads. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.

               he said he did. He advised he would be over to pick it up right

               NARRATIVE: On 01-16-14 at about 1708 hours I was dispatched to
               the report of a theft. Whitcom advised that the RP, Benjamin J.
               Delgado, was requesting phone contact. I called Delgado and he
               told me that sometime in the last hour he had several thousand
               dollars worth of photography equipment stolen. He told me that
               he is in the process of moving from Waller Hall room 341 to
               Waller Hall room 303. He said that while he was moving he had
               the doors to both rooms open. He said that he had just moved
               all of his photography equipment into his new room, 303, and
               went back to 341 to get another load. He said that when he
               returned he noticed his photography equipment gone. Delgado
               told me that he made contact with all of his neighbors and
               nobody had any information for him about who may have taken his
               equipment. Delgado told me that inside the camera bag that was
               stolen there were 4 or 5 camera lenses, a camera body, chargers
               and a lens filter. He described the bag as a cloth bag with a
               leather handle that has his name burnt into the underside of
               it. Delgado told me that he did not have the serial numbers,
               makes, models or exact values of any of the equipment right
               now, but he would email it to me. I provided Delgado with my
               email address and express the importance of getting this
               information to me as soon as possible. He said he would. As of
               01-17-14 at 0015 hours I have not received an email from
               Delgado. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 17th day of January, 2014, in Pullman,

               NARRATIVE: ON 01-16-14 at about 2113 hours WSU units and medics
               were dispatched to the report of an unconscious female found in
               the stairwell of Wilmer Hall. I arrived on scene and saw
               several hall staff around a female that was now sitting against
               the wall in the landing area of the stairs. I tried talking to
               the female in an attempt to figure out what happened. She was
               talking but what she was saying did not make sense. I got her
               name from her WSU Cougar Card, Maacah C. Cantu, and asked her
               what her birthday was. She told me 11-20-94. I asked Cantu
               where she was and she said "Stephenson". I asked her where she
               lived and she said "Ganon/Goldsworthy". When I asked for her
               phone number she was unable to provide one. I tried asking
               Cantu several other questions, all of which she could not or
               would not answer. I was unable to get any information from her
               about where she had been, what she was under the influence of
               or who she had been with. Cantu was transported by ambulance to
               PRH. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the
               laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 16th day of January, 2014, in Pullman,

               01-17-14 Cpl. Edwards, Officer Welter, and I were dispatched to
               a possible suicide attempt in Stephenson South #1123. Upon our
               arrival we stopped at the door and listened. We could hear a
               female talking to another female. It appeared to be a phone
               conversation with one person on speaker. We listen for a few
               seconds, but didn't hear anything about Tenwani hurting
               herself. Edwards knocked on the door and Tenwani answered the
               door. I told her why we were there and asked if she could talk
               to me. She was kind of evasive at first but eventually told her
               friend that she would call her back. I asked her if she was
               wanting to harm herself and she said she wasn't. I asked why
               someone would have thought that and called us to check on her.
               He said she didn't know. Edwards began speaking to Tenwani.
               Tenwani stated that he had just ended a relationship with her
               boyfriend and has having some difficulty with transitioning to
               single life. She said she was doing better since she was
               speaking to her friend. She was asked if she was going to harm
               herself and she said "No, I am fine." She was asked if she
               wanted us to call counseling services and she said "No, I am
               fine as long as I can finish the conversation with my friend."
               The floor R/A showed up and asked what was going on. I explain
               the situation to her and she asked if she could speak to
               Tenwani. It was determined that Tenwani was not going to harm
               herself and that she would go to the R/A's room for further
               conversation. Tenwani was told to call 911 or the hot line if
               she felt as if she was going to harm herself. She said she
               would. Nothing further........... I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 17th day of
