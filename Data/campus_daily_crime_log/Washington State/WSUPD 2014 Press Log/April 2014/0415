               used in a crime in the past week. I checked our calls for the

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 041514 around 1825 hrs I was
               dispatched to a report of a stolen cell phone from the locker
               room of the Student Recreation Center (SRC). I contacted the
               reporting party, later identified as Yueqi Hu (100787) and told
               the following. Hu explained that he had been at the SRC and had
               been in the locker room changing after using the facilities. He
               placed his pants, which contained his WSU Student ID card along
               with his Samsung Galaxy S4 cell phone on the bench while he
               went to take a shower. When he returned he noticed that his
               pants had been moved and that he cell phone was missing. Hu
               contacted staff members for the SRC and was told they had not
               had the phone turned into them, at which point the WSU Police
               Department was contacted. As we continued to speak Hu told me
               he had tried to track his phone but that it had appeared to
               have been turned off. I asked him who his cell phone carrier
               was and he told me it had is AT&T at which point I asked him if
               he could access his account, which he did. We attempted to
               locate the serial number for the phone and were unable to find
               it. I asked him to contact them and get the number for me so I
               could enter the phone as stolen and was told he would do that.
               At this point we discussed what information he accessed on his
               phone and he told me he used it to access the WSU Network while
               on campus. I asked him for his login in name which he gave me
               as yueqi_hu@wsu.edu. I explained that I was going to forward
               this information onto Information Technologies and see if they
               would be able to locate the phone on the network. We also spoke
               about reporting his cell phone as being stolen and changing the
               passwords to his various accounts linked to his phone, which he
               told me he would change. Hu thanked me for our help and I
               provided him with my business card and case number for
               reference. I also told him if he was able to locate the phone
               using his tracking program to let me know. He told me he would
               and I cleared a short time later. Some time later I emailed
               pd.cases@wsu with the information Hu had provided me and asked
               them to try and track the phone. I will await any information
               from Hu or Information Technologies before proceeding further.
               I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws
               of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and

               STUDENT: ____YES ____NO OTHER UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 041514
               at approximately 1913 hours I heard WCSO being toned to a
               physical domestic just west of Banner Rd. All the County units
               were quite a ways from the area, so I offered Deputy Jordan my
               assistance. He requested I respond. I arrived on scene at 2602
               Pullman Albion Rd and awaited Deputy Jordan. From a concealed
               position I could hear some periodic yelling from the area but
               nothing seemed to be physical. Once Deputy Jordan arrived we
               appraoched the trailer. The RP, Lameece N. Dillsi (020273) was
               retrieving her pit bull and indicated that her children's
               father was in the nearby vehicle. Dillsi took the dog inside.
               At the vehicle we spoke with Toussaint L. Tyler (031959). He
               was detained and we used 3 sets of handcuffs to accomodate his
               size and reported pre-existing medical conditions. He bleeding
               slightly from his hand but it seemed to get worse the longer we
               were there. Once in handcuffs I sat Tyler on their stoop and
               Deputy Jordan went inside to speak with Dillsi. Tyler was read
               his Miranda rights. He would not tell me much. He denied any
               physical contact between he and Dillsi. He said they had argued
               but that was it. He said she had a drug problem. He said he got
               cut when he reached for a phone that Dillsi had in her hand. In
               that same hand Dillsi had an exacto type knife and he cut
               himself. He said it was not intentional. She reportedly had not
               been on the phone with 911 at the time. Deputy Waltz arrived on
               scene and we worked on stopping Tyler's bleeding and he refused
               medics. Deputy Jordan told me that the stories seemed to match
               and there were no specifics. I spoke with Dillsi about how the
               dispatcher's had perceived that the event was physical. She
               said she did not remember any physical contact but was also
               aware that if there had been that most likely someone would go
               to jail. She would not give any specifics for us to go on.
               Deputy Keller arrived towards the end of our time there. Deputy
               Jordan provided Tyler with a transport to a friend's house and
               I cleared. Two unidentified minor children were present for
               this event. Tyler was informed he had a suspended license.
               Nothing follows. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 16th day of April, 2014, in

               approximately 2151 hours, I responded to the Columbia
               Apartments where Conner W. Phillips had overheard a fight at
               unit J29. I spoke to Phillips who said he was in his apartment
               (K33) and could overhear yelling and shouting. Phillips said he
               looked out the window and could only see from the legs down of
               two people physically fighting. Phillips called 911 but stated
               that one person had already left. Phillips said this all
               occurred inside and in front of unit J29. I walked over to J29
               and knocked on the door. While I was knocking I could hear
               yelling coming from area of the Rogers Orton Playfield. I
               walked over to the area and found two people yelling. I
               contacted Robert F. Zaragoza 01/10/90 and Trenton J. Williams
               10/17/93. Ofc. Welter spoke to Trenton while I spoke with
               Robert. Robert was visibly upset and I could see tears on his
               cheeks. I asked Robert what was going on. Robert stated he and
               his little brother, who is also his roommate, Philip Zaragoza
               07/01/94, got into a fight. Robert said that he had lost his
               keys to his apartment a while ago and housing had just finished
               installing new locks. Robert said he had the new keys to the
               apartment with him and left for a bible study class. Robert
               said out of habit he locked all the doors. Robert stated that
               Philip came home while he was at bible study and was very upset
               due to being locked out of the house. When Robert got home
               Philip and him began to argue. Both of the brothers were in
               each other's face yelling when Philip punched Robert in the
               chest and face. Trenton stepped in to separate the two and
               Philip scratched Robert above his left eye. Robert said after
               the short physical fight he left the house with Trenton. Robert
               stated that he did not punch or hit Philip however he was
               verbally antagonizing him. Robert said Philip was still in the
               house. I looked at Robert's face where he said he was hit. I
               did not see any red marks, abrasions, or swelling on Robert's
               face. I asked Robert if he would like medics to check him out
               and he said no. I photographed Robert's face for documentation.
               I contacted Philip who was speaking with Sgt. Griffin. I

               noticed two band-aids and blood on Philip's right hand's
               knuckles. I asked what the cuts were from and Philip said he
               cut his hand on Robert's tooth when he punched him. The other
               cut was from him punching a door. I asked Philip what happened.
               Philip said he was locked out of the house and he was upset
               because the locks were changed. When Robert came home Philip
               and Robert began to argue. Philip said he got in Robert's face
               and Robert did the same. Philip stated Robert "chest bumped"
               him and Trenton tried to get in between them. Philip said, "and
               then I swung at him." Philip said he was swinging at Robert
               while Trenton was trying to hold him back. Philip admitted to
               hitting Robert in the mouth. I asked Philip if he would like
               medical treatment for his hand. Philip said it was not
               necessary. I explained the domestic violence laws to Philip and
               told him he was under arrest for assault 4th degree, domestic
               violence. I handcuffed (D/L) Philip and advised him of his
               right to counsel. With Philip's permission, Philip and I walked
               into his apartment to retrieve Philip's jacket and cell phone.
               I Mirandized Philip off my department issued card and Philip
               stated he understood his rights. Robert was given a domestic
               violence pamphlet by Ofc. Welter. See Ofc. Welter's supplement
               for further details on his interview of Trenton. I transported
               Philip to the Whitman County Jail where he was booked on
               Assault 4th degree Domestic Violence. Charges will be forwarded
               to the Prosecutor. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 16th day of
               April, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.
