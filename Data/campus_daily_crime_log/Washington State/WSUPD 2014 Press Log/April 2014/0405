               NARRATIVE: On 04/05/14 at approximately 0715 hours I was
               dispatched to the yellow lot off of SE Columbia Ave near SE
               Spokane St. I responded and located the reporting party,
               Christopher Chaney, standing next to a vehicle with the
               driver's side tires slashed. Chaney explained that he rented
               the vehicle from Motor Pool yesterday and parked it at its
               current location at 1600 hours on 04/04/14. Chaney said when he
               got to the vehicle at approximately 0710 hours he noticed the
               tires were slashed. I took photos of the vehicle and tires. I
               asked Chaney if he already contacted the after hours contact
               for Motor Pool and he said he did. I provided Chaney with my
               business card and case number. It appears this is part of a
               common scheme of tire slashing, two on campus and approximately
               8 in Pullman's jurisdiction specifically around the Coffee
               House Apts. on Latah St. I called Brad Hill from Motor Pool and
               informed him of the case. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 5th day of April,
               2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               hrs I was dispatched to a report of a hit and run vehicle
               collision in the parking lot located on the north side of the
               Old Bookie Building, located at 700 NE Thatuna Street. I
               contacted the complainant, Roger C. Shaw (DOB 08-04-1945), on
               the telephone. Shaw stated that on 04-05-2014 at about 1030 hrs
               he parked his rental car in the southeast corner of the parking
               lot. He returned to his vehicle later that same day at about
               1400 hrs and discovered that it had been damaged. Shaw told me
               that he found two long scratch marks and white paint transfer
               on the front, driver side door. The scratch marks were about 2
               to 3 feet long and traveled along the length of the door. Shaw
               said he bought some car wax, returned to his hotel, and
               attempted to buff out the scratches. Shaw said the damage was
               still visible after he waxed the door. Shaw provided me with
               two photographs of the damage, and the photographs have been
               downloaded into Spillman. I viewed the photographs and saw that
               the damage was similar to what would have been caused by
               another vehicle rubbing up against the side of Shaw's vehicle.
               The damage is estimated to be $800.00. Shaw's rental car was
               identified as a gray, 2014 Subaru Outback (WA Lic. AOY9683),
               and the vehicle is registered to Dollar Rent A Car. I provided
               Shaw with the case number and instructed him to report the
               incident to the rental company. No suspects or leads were
               identified. No further action at this time. Olmstead/339 I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of

               NARRATIVE: On 040514 at approximately 2237 hours I was driving
               westbound on NE Colorado St near Northside Residence Hall when
               I heard some yelling near the entrance. I then saw a male,
               later identified as Emmittwally L. Sua-Kalio (111794), hoisting
               a 1.75 L bottle of Captain Morgan's Rum in the air. He appeared
               to be under 21 and I later recognized him as I had dealt with
               him previously. I pulled over and got out of my car and I
               believe Sua-Kalio saw me, so he walked over to a nearby vehicle
               (WA/AMT1336) and handed the bottle into the front passenger. I
               approached and asked to see the bottle. The passenger, Alondra
               R. Girard (091695), showed me the bottle that was about 1/5th
               full. Girard, Sua-Kalio, and the unidentified driver all
               admitted to being under 21. Sua-Kalio said the bottle was his
               friends but he later admitted to drinking a quarter of the
               bottle. I could smell the odor of intoxicants on Sua-Kalio's
               breath. I checked his eyes and observed a lack of smooth
               pursuit in both eyes. He admitted to have been drinking. He
               provided a voluntary breath sample of .154 for my PBT. Girard
               appeared to be sober and was unfortunately the closest option
               for Sua-Kalio to hide the bottle. I had Sua-Kalio pour the
               bottle out. I told him I would refer only him to Student
               Conduct and not Girard. Both subjects were very cooperative and
               polite. I cleared. Nothing follows. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 6th day of

               04/05/14 at approximately 2245 hours, I was driving southbound
               on Stadium Way near Wilson Rd and had a green light to continue
               southbound on Stadium Way. When I was about halfway into the
               intersection a female ran in front of my patrol car from the
               westbound side of Stadium Way to the eastbound side. I had to
               slow down in order not to hit the female. I made a U-turn and
               contacted the female who was now standing on the eastside
               sidewalk of Stadium Way. I turned on my emergency lights and
               exited my patrol car. As I walked up to the female, later
               identified as Juliana Morgan Thomsen 02/13/95, I saw her set
               down two aluminum water bottles. I asked Thomsen why she ran in
               front of my patrol car. Thomsen said she was running down the
               hill and thought she would make it before my car. Thomsen said
               he was just coming from an event at the Fine Arts Building. I
               asked Thomsen what was in her water bottles. Thomsen said they
               were empty. I asked Thomsen if I could look at the water
               bottles and she said "yeah." Thomsen handed me one water bottle
               which was empty. I asked about the second water bottle and
               Thomsen handed it too me. This water bottle had liquid inside.
               I asked Thomsen if I would find alcohol in the bottle and
               Thomsen said, "you might." When I opened the top I could
               instantly smell the odor of alcohol coming from the bottle.
               Thomsen provided her name and date of birth verbally. Thomsen
               identified herself as 19 years old. I asked Thomsen how much
               she had to drink tonight. Thomsen said, "barely anything." I
               asked how much was barely anything and Thomsen said about a
               shot. I asked Thomsen if I could check her eyes and she said I
               could. I performed an HGN test on Thomsen. During the test I
               observed lack of smooth pursuit and distinct and sustained
               nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes. I could also smell
               the odor of intoxicants coming from Thomsen's breath. I asked
               Thomsen what was in the bottle. Thomsen said it was soda. I
               told Thomsen there was alcohol in the bottle and Thomsen said
               there was also Vodka in the bottle. I asked Thomsen if she had
               been arrested before. Thomsen said she was arrested for
               shoplifting about a month ago in Pullman. I told Thomsen that
               she was under arrest for possession of alcohol as a minor. I

               incident to arrest and no weapons or items of evidentiary value
               were found. Thomsen was transported to Pullman Holding
               Facility. Once at the Holding Facility, Thomsen was
               fingerprinted and photographed. I issued Thomsen Sector
               citation 4Z0410283 for RCW 66.44.270.2A MIP Possession. I
               explained the citation to Thomsen and provided her with her
               copy. I provided Thomsen with a courtesy transport to her dorm,
               Perham Hall. Once at Perham Hall, Thomsen was released from
               custody and I cleared. Nothing further. I certify and declare

               began to wake Vallejo Lopez. Both appeared to be under 21 and I
               could smell alcohol coming from them. Both of their eyes
               appeared to be watery. I told Vallejo Lopez we needed to go
               outside to talk as the noise was distracting. She said "I'm
               good" repeatedly. She was unstable on her feet and she looked
               to walk away so I held her left arm. She had lethargic
               movements. Both Vallejo Lopez and Garcia attempted to brush me
               aside, walking a fine line of assaulting or obstructing me. I
               was calling for backup on the radio but could not be heard. The
               nearest exit was blocked with trash cans and I instructed
               Garcia to move them and he complied. Once I got them outside I
               explained that if either of them touched me again they would be
               going to jail. They were instructed to stand against the wall.
               Garcia began the commonly heard mantra that they lived nearby
               and they could just go home. Ofc. Westerman arrived shortly
               after with Intern Wolff for backup. I checked Vallejo Lopez's
               eyes and observed a lack of smooth pursuit and distinct and
               sustained nystagmus in both eyes. I could smell the odor of
               intoxicants on her breath. When I asked her how much she had
               drank she said "Not really, I just wanted to be happy and just
               college life". She told me she "did Law Enforcement". She
               refused a PBT and was told she was not free to go. I then
               checked Garcia's eyes and observed a lack of smooth pursuit in
               both eyes. He was not sure how much he drank that night. He
               gave a voluntary breath sample of .105. I could smell the odor

               of intoxicants on his breath. He is a student at Columbia Basin
               College. I then gave Vallejo Lopez another opportunity to
               provide a breath sample and she declined. I told her to put her
               hands behind her back and she put them behind her head. She was
               placed under arrest for MIP-Exhibiting. She was informed of her
               right to an attorney and informed she was being recorded. She
               was placed in handcuffs. I informed Garcia that I would be
               forwarding charges of MIP-Exhibiting on him and had Ofc.
               Westerman explain that process to him. I took Vallejo Lopez to
               my patrol car where she had difficulty getting into the car. I
               then read her Miranda rights. We were then alerted to a Weapons
               Offense regarding a possible shot fired at Terrace Apartments.
               I released Vallejo Lopez as Ofc. Boyd was still occupied with
               the original intoxicated individual. I told Vallejo Lopez that
               I would be forwarding the charge on her for the MIP. I summoned
               Garcia who was waiting an appropriate distance away. I told him
               I was releasing her and forwarding charges. I asked if he could
               tell her what Ofc. Westerman had told him. I told Vallejo Lopez
               that if she had any questions she could call WSU PD the next
               day. I returned her Cougar Card. I cleared and went to the
               Weapons Offense. Nothing follows. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 6th day of

               approximately 0034 hours, I was dispatched to a weapons offense
               in the area of the Terrace Apartments. Dispatch stated a person
               living in the Terrace Apartments, unit 504, had heard a noise
               that they believed to be a gun shot. Dispatch stated the
               reporting party believed the noise came from the area between
               the Terrace Apartments and the Cougs Corner Mart. I recognized
               this area to be Boulder Creek. I had dispatch make Pullman
               Police aware that the noise most likely came from their
               jurisdiction. I searched the area but did not hear any other
               similar noises. Pullman PD Officers advised unless I found
               something they would not be responding. I went out on foot near
               Steptoe Village since I had seen several people behind one of
               the Boulder Creek apartments. I contacted a group of males who
               said they did not hear any noises like I had described. I
               warned the group that it would not be wise to shoot off any
               other fireworks if they had been involved. I found no evidence
               of a gun discharging or firework material as I walked around.
               Finding no evidence I cleared. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               NARRATIVE: On 04/06/14 at approximately 0008 hours I was
               driving westbound on Colorado St near the Scott Coman
               construction area. The northside sidewalk of Colorado St near
               Scott Coman is closed off due to construction. There is a chain
               link fence that protrudes into the roadway on Colorado. Due to
               this there is signs requiring pedestrians to cross the street
               prior to the construction and use the southside sidewalk. As I
               reached that section of fence I had to stop my patrol car in
               the roadway to avoid hitting a female walking along the fence.
               I exited my patrol car and asked the female why she was walking
               in the roadway. The female, later identified as Riley Paige
               Sorensen 05/25/95, said there was no sidewalk. I asked why she
               did not use the other sidewalk like the signs said. Sorensen
               said she did not see the signs. I had Sorensen walk over to the
               sidewalk so were were out of the street. I asked Sorensen if
               she had her ID with her and she said no. Sorensen provided her
               information verbally. Sorensen identified herself as 18 years
               old. As Sorensen spoke I could smell the odor of intoxicants
               coming from her breath. I asked Sorensen how much she had to
               drink and she said just a little bit. I asked Sorensen if I
               could check her eyes and she said I could. During the HGN test
               I observed, lack of smooth pursuit and distinct and sustained
               nystagmus at maximum deviation. I again asked Sorensen how much
               she had to drink. Sorensen said she was not sure because she
               was drinking off a mixed drink for most of the night. I asked
               Sorensen if she would provide a PBT sample. Sorensen said she
               would and provided a sample of .105. I ran Sorensen's
               information and got no return. I asked Sorensen about her
               information and she said she was an exchange student from
               England. I asked Sorensen what he drinking age in England was.
               Sorensen said it was 18 years old. I asked Sorensen what the
               drinking age in the United States was. Sorensen said 21 years
               old. Sorensen confirmed she knew it was illegal to drink
               alcohol until you are 21 years old. I researched Sorensen's
               name and she has not been arrested or contacted by the Police
               before. I told Sorensen that I would be forwarding charges to
               the prosecutor for MIP Exhibiting. I explained the process to

               Densiel Torres-Sapp 07/31/95, standing between two parked cars
               on Wilson Rd. Sapp appeared to be urinating on the street.
               Sapp's back was towards me while I crossed the street. I walked
               up to Sapp and could see and hear him urinating. I turned on my
               flashlight but Sapp did not notice. I walked towards the side
               of Sapp and Sapp finally noticed me. Sapp quickly stopped
               urinating mid stream and attempted to cover himself. Before I
               could say anything Sapp said he was very embarrassed. I asked
               Sapp why he was peeing on the street. Sapp said he really had
               to pee. I pointed out all the bathrooms surrounding him. Sapp
               said he was not from the area and did not know about the
               bathrooms. I could smell the odor of intoxicants coming from
               Sapp's breath and asked him how much he had to drink. Sapp said
               he had two Corona Beers. Sapp provided his WADL that identified
               him as 18 years old. I told Sapp that I would not be arresting
               him for MIP Exhibiting but he would be receiving a citation for

               a patient refusal and we all cleared. Nothing follows. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 6th day of April, 2014, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 04/06/14 at approximately 0237 hours
               I was driving westbound on Colorado Street near the Soccer
               Field when I noticed a tan Mazda sedan heading eastbound on
               Colorado Street towards me. The vehicle appeared to be
               traveling faster than the posted 20 MPH zone. I activated my in
               car moving radar (vehicle 16) and obtained a reading of 34 MPH.
               When the car passed me, I turned around and initiated a traffic
               stop at Colorado St and Bohler Gym. I contacted Valdillez and
               explained why I had stopped him. Valdillez said he was trying
               to get his friends home. I asked Valdillez if he had his
               driver's license with him. Valdillez said no and his driver's
               license was suspended. As I stood at the car I could smell the
               strong odor of intoxicants coming from the car. There were
               three other occupants in the car other than Valdillez. I asked
               Valdillez to come talk to me outside of the car. Valdillez
               exited and walked over to the sidewalk. Once outside of the car
               Valdillez provided his information verbally. When I was talking
               to Valdillez I could clearly smell the odor of intoxicants
               coming from his breath. I asked Valdillez how much he had to
               drink tonight. Valdillez said he had been day drinking but
               "that was it." Valdillez said he stop drinking around 2100
               hours. I asked Valdillez to provide a PBT sample which he did.
               I asked Valdillez if he had taken a PBT test before and he said
               yes about a year ago. I asked about the circumstances regarding
               him taking a PBT a year ago. Valdillez said it was from a DUI
               arrest. I asked Valdillez if he was suspended from that DUI and
               he said yes. Valdillez provided a PBT sample of .097 after only
               about a half of a full sample. I asked Valdillez if he was
               willing to do some voluntary field sobriety tests. Valdillez
               said he would. The tests were conducted on a level and paved
               sidewalk on the eastside sidewalk of Colorado Street. Valdillez
               was wearing a button up shirt, jeans, and penny loafer styled
               shoes at the time of the tests. The sidewalk was lit by street
               lights, patrol car spot light, and personal flashlight. I
               explained to Valdillez that I would be evaluating him on how
               well he followed my instructions as well as how well he
               performed the tests. The first test I administered was the HGN

               test. I instructed Valdillez to stand with his heels and toes
               together and keep his arms at his sides. I told Valdillez to
               remain in that position while I administered the test.
               Valdillez stated he understood. I told Valdillez to follow the
               tip of my pen with his eyes only and not to move his head. I
               held my pen approximately 12-15 inches away from Valdillez's
               head. During the test I observed, equal pupil size, equal
               tracking, lack of smooth pursuit, distinct and sustained
               nystagmus at maximum deviation, and onset of nystagmus prior to
               45 degrees in both eyes. Valdillez eyes were bloodshot and
               watery. During the test Valdillez was guessing where my pen was
               going to go instead of following it as instructed. I had to
               tell Valdillez several times to follow the pen. The next test I
               administered was the walk and turn. I told Valdillez to place
               his left foot on an imaginary line before him. I then
               instructed Valdillez to place his right foot heel to toe in
               front of his left foot and keep his arms at his side. Valdillez
               got into the starting position as instructed. I told Valdillez
               to remain in that position as I gave further instructions. I
               told Valdillez, when I tell you to begin, don't begin until I
               tell you, you will take a series of nine heel to toe steps down
               the line, with your arms at your side, looking down at your
               feet, and counting your steps out loud. Once you reach your
               ninth step leave your lead foot planted and with your rear foot
               take a series of small steps until you are facing where you
               came from and again take nine return heel to toe steps. I
               demonstrated the test for Valdillez. I reminded Valdillez to
               keep his arms at his side, count his steps out loud, look down
               at his feet, and do not stop the test until he had completed
               it. I asked Valdillez if he understood and Valdillez said he
               did. I told Valdillez he could begin as soon as he was ready.
               Instruction Phase: No errors observed. First Nine Steps:
               Valdillez was not looking down at his feet on steps 1 through
               3. Return Nine Steps: No errors observed. The next test I
               administered was the One Leg Stand. I instructed Valdillez to
               stand with his heels and toes together and keep his arms at his
               side. I told Valdillez to remain in that position while I gave
               him further instructions. I told Valdillez, when I tell you to
               begin, don't begin until I tell you, you will raise either leg
               of your choice and raise it six inches off the ground. You must
               point your toe so the sole of your shoe is parallel with the
               ground. While pointing your toe, keep your arms at your side,
               leg straight, look down at your foot and count out loud, one
               thousand one, one thousand two, one thousand three, and so on
               until I tell you to stop. If at any point you put your foot
               down, go ahead and pick it right back up and continue counting
               where ever you left off. I demonstrated the test and asked
               Valdillez if he understood and he stated yes. I told Valdillez
               to begin whenever he was ready. As soon as I told Valdillez to
               start he raised his foot only about 2 inches off the ground and
               was pointing his toe towards the sky. After 2 seconds Valdillez
               lost his balance and put his foot down. Valdillez picked up his
               foot and again started counting. When Valdillez reached 1009 he
               next counted 1006, 1010, 1011. Throughout the test Valdillez
               was swaying side to side struggling to keep his balance. While

               I was conducting the SFST's, Intern Wolff ran Valdillez through
               dispatch. Dispatch confirmed that Valdillez's driver's license
               was suspended in the 3rd degree through Washington. I told
               Valdillez that he was under arrest for DUI and driving on a
               suspended license. I handcuffed (D/L) Valdillez and advised
               Valdillez of his right to counsel. At my direction, Intern
               Wolff searched Valdillez incident to arrest. Nothing of
               evidentiary value was found. I placed Valdillez in the back
               seat of my patrol car. I told Valdillez that his vehicle was
               going to be towed and wanted to know if there was anything in
               the car he wanted out of it. Valdillez said no. Ofc. Boyd
               stayed with the vehicle and I transported Valdillez to Pullman
               Police Department for BAC. Upon arrival I checked the
               Datamaster and found it working properly, with the RFI antenna
               attached, the mouth tube warm to the touch, and a temperature
               within ranges. At 0306 hours I checked Valdillez's mouth
               finding no foreign substances. I read Valdillez his
               Constitutional Rights at 0308 hours. Valdillez stated he
               understood his rights and signed he understood his rights and
               decided not to exercise his rights. I read Valdillez the
               Implied Consent Warning for Breath. After reading the warning I
               asked Valdillez to sign the line that states, "I have read or
               had read to me the above statement(s)." Valdillez said, "I
               refuse." I asked Valdillez if he was refusing to sign and he
               said yes. I wrote "refused to sign" on his spot. I asked
               Valdillez if he was refusing to sign because he did not
               understand the implied consent warning for breath. I told
               Valdillez that I could read the implied consent again for him.
               Valdillez said, "I understand, I just... " and shook his head.
               I asked if he just did not want to sign and Valdillez said yes.
               I next asked Valdillez to check the yes or no box if he was
               willing to provide a breath sample. Valdillez said no. I asked
               Valdillez if he was saying no he would not check the box or if
               no he would not provide a breath sample. Valdillez said no he
               would not check a box. I told Valdillez that I needed a yes or
               no answer to if he was willing to provide a breath sample.
               Valdillez said "no" that he would not provide a breath sample.
               I told Valdillez that I would be applying for a search warrant
               for his blood. Valdillez was placed in a holding cell as I
               applied for the blood warrant. I applied for and was granted a
               blood search warrant by Judge Robinson. At approximately 0440
               hours I read Valdillez a copy of the warrant. About this time
               Pullman Fire Medics arrived for the blood draw. I provided
               paramedic Blake Richards with the blood draw kit. I watched as
               Richards swabbed the crook of Valdillez's left arm with Iodine.
               I watched as Richards drew blood the blood into the two grey
               top vials. Richards turned over the blood vials to me and I
               initialed both vials. The blood kit was later logged into
               evidence and marked to be sent to the state crime lab for
               analysis. I provided Valdillez a copy of the following
               documents: Driver's Hearing Request, Fee Waiver form, tow and
               impound form, and the refusal breath test document. Per RCW
               10.31.100.2d anybody who has had any prior DUI offenses in the
               last ten years are subject to booking. I transported Valdillez
               to the Whitman County Jail where he was booked on his DUI and

               DWLS charges. Valdillez's vehicle was impounded by Myers'
               Towing for 12 hours. Pending the results of the blood sample,
               charges of DUI and DWLS 3rd degree will be forwarded to the
               prosecutor. My VieVu camera footage was uploaded to the
               department's computer. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
