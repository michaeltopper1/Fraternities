               received a report of a school bus stop violation from Pullman
               School District #267. According to the report the violation
               occurred on Thursday, April 17, 2014 at about 1548 hours at the
               bus stop on Forest Way at the Yakima Village school bus stop.
               The OSPI School Bus Stop Violation report form has been added
               to the case file. Daniel P Jernigan was operating bus #2, a
               fully marked Pullman School District #267 school bus. The bus
               was stopped in the roadway to discharge school children using
               the red lights and stop paddle for traffic control. Jernigan
               writes that the suspect vehicle "Pass my bus opposing me. I
               attempted to get their attention with my air horn, but they did
               not slow or stop." Jernigan described the vehicle as being blue
               in color, Dodge, Caravan with Washington license plate AOT9520.
               Jernigan describes the driver as being a male with short hair.
               The vehicle license returns to a Alhardi, Salman Mohammad S.
               with an 880 NE Providence Court, Apt N101 address. The vehicle
               and driver were not found in Spillman. I mailed the registered
               owner a letter notifying them of the violation. The letter has
               been scanned into the case. No infractions or citations issued.
               The OSPI form has been filled out and returned to the Pullman
               School District as well as scanned into the case. No further
               investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 21st day of April, 2014, in

               was dispatched to people using chalk to draw on Terrell Mall. I
               responded to the area where I located four (4) female WSU
               Students near the Terrell Mall and Library Rd intersection. The
               females said the art work belonged to them. They wanted to
               raise awareness about the sweat shops in Bangladesh. I talked
               to them about drawing on the mall and gave them a better option
               of using the chalk board at the Fine Arts Plaza. All four
               females were appologetic and said they didn't realize they were
               causing any problems. They said it will not happen again. I
               spoke with them about their cause and told them they can always
               stop by the police department to inquire if their protest or
               ways to raise awareness are allowed. As I was talking with them
               rain began to fall lightly. The forecast calls for rain tonight
               and tomorrow. The rain will wash away the chalk. There is no
               damage to any WSU property. No further investigation. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.

               STUDENT: ____YES ____NO OTHER UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 042114
               at approximately 1625 hours I was dispatched to a Fraud. I
               called the RP, Melinda A. Lee (121692), and left her a message
               as she had requested phone contact. I called her a few minutes
               later and got hold of her. Lee stated that she had bank
               documents showing the fraud. I told her it would be best if we
               met. She agreed to meet with me, so I retrieved, her from
               Regents and returned to the station with her. On 041914 at
               approximately 1738 hours, Lee received a text message on her
               cell phone stating her WSECU card had been deactivated and to
               call 360-552-411. Lee call the number and reached an automated
               answering service that requested her card number, security
               number, and PIN. The original text had been made from number
               206-604-0138. Lee showed me a spreadsheet of transactions. The
               columns are not fully opened so some information is hard to
               interpret but it appears that at least $2000 has been removed
               from the account. It looks like the withdrawls and purchases
               were made in Mesa and Tempe, AZ. There appears to be 2 ATM
               withdrawls that could have camera's on them. There is also a
               Walmart (Store #2768) listed twice. These transactions took
               place on 041914 and 042014. I provided Lee with her case number
               and requested she contact her bank to gain more information on
               her spreadsheet. I told her I would contact Mesa PD to see if
               they were aware of this activity. Lee's card has been cancelled
               and WSECU is apparently aware of the fraudulent activity of
               this scam. I informed Lee that if she needed emergency funds
               that the Dean of Students may be able to help. Lee left and I
               called Mesa PD. I was directed to the voicemail of their Fraud
               Sgt, a Tony Hibbings. I left a message for him to call me back.
               Case pending information from Lee and Mesa PD. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               04/21/14 at approximately 2244 hours, I was dispatched to a
               drugs call at Waller Hall room 42. The reporting party, Timothy
               E. Martin, stated the odor of marijuana was coming from room 42
               in Waller Hall. I remembered that Officer Boyd had just taken a
               drugs call at room 42 on 04/19/14. Upon arrival I noticed the
               hallway smelled of burnt marijuana. When I reached room 42 I
               smelled the door crack but did not smell the odor any stronger
               than what was present in the hallway. I knocked on the door and
               Trevor Eugene Vaught 04/13/95 opened the door. I explained the
               reason I was at his room and Vaught said he did not have any
               marijuana. Vaught said he had not smoked since Saturday when he
               was contacted by Ofc. Boyd. When I was standing at Vaught's
               door I could not smell the odor of marijuana coming from the
               room. I asked Vaught if he had smoked elsewhere and then come
               back to his door causing the odor to follow him. Again, Vaught
               said he had not smoked. I asked if I could look around his room
               to support his claim that he had no marijuana. Vaught said he
               did not want me to come in. I told Vaught that he would be
               referred to student conduct for this case. While I was speaking
               with Vaught, Cpl. Daniels was watching Vaught's window from the
               exterior of the building. Cpl. Daniels said when I left
               Vaught's room, Vaught started to quickly move things around his
               room as if he was trying to hide something. What he was trying
               to hide is unknown. Nothing further. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               alarm was for motion sensors activated in the gallery. I
