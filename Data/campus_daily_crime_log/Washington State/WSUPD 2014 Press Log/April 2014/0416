               ____NO OTHER UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 04/16/14 at
               approximately 1330 hours I met with the reporting party, Omar
               Rubio, in the lobby of the WSUPD. Rubio wanted to report a hit
               and run collision. I asked Rubio where the collision occurred.
               Rubio explained that the collision occurred on the 2nd floor of
               the CUE parking garage, on 04/09/14 between 1200-1400 hours.
               Rubio said he was parked near the elevators. I asked Rubio
               where the car was and he said it was now back in Pasco and
               explained that he had borrowed it from his brother in law. I
               asked Rubio if he had any pictures of the damage and he said he
               had them on his phone. Rubio said there was white paint
               transfer to the front passenger side of the car. I asked Rubio
               to email me the photos. I gave Rubio my business card with the
               case number. Rubio later sent me two photos of the damage to
               the vehicle. Looking at the pictures it is my opinion, as well
               as several other department members, that the damage was caused
               by a concrete or cement object, such as a pillar. The pictures
               show what appears to be scratches consistent with hitting a
               pillar, based upon my training and experience, as well as paint
               missing from the area. However, I did not see the vehicle first
               hand and over a week has gone by since the collision occurred.
               I called Rubio and asked him to meet me in the parking garage
               so he could show me the exact spot he was parked in when it
               happened. Rubio took me to stall #278, which was consistent
               with what he explained to me. I asked Rubio if he was sure it
               happened in the garage and he said he was. Rubio said that he
               did not initially notice the damage, but he dropped a friend
               off on his way home and they pointed it out. I thanked Rubio
               for his time. Due to the fact the collision was reported over a
               week after it occurred and I did not personally see the car I
               can not confirm or deny the facts that were provided to me. I
               saved the pictures to the case. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               Cpl Kuhrt and I were dispatched to a report of a possible
               domestic in progress at 775 SE Forest Wy in apartment 643. As
               we were en route to the location we were told the reporting
               party could hear what sounding like something being slammed or
               throwing within the apartment. Kuhrt and I contacted the
               occupants inside of the apartment the male, later identified as
               Michael E Boudar (071180), was asked to come outside and speak
               with me while Kuhrt spoke with the female inside. Upon speaking
               with Boudar I asked him what had been going on and he explained
               that an argument had ensued over the date he was scheduled to
               return to Houston Texas for work. He explained to me that his
               wife, identified by Kuhrt as Alicia Y Sanmiguel (110483), had
               been trying to change the date of his departure on three
               occasions and he was sick of it. Boudar continued and explained
               that they had not been getting along for some time and Alicia
               had been stressed over her Phd program, which just made things
               worse. We spoke about this at which point I asked him what had
               happened prior to our arrival. He told me the argument had
               become heated quickly at which point a box had been thrown
               followed by him knocking a container of pens off of the
               counter, causing it to hit the wall before falling to the
               floor. I asked him if there had been any contact between him
               and Alicia and was told there wasn't . He went on to explain
               that immediately following this incident he had picked up the
               baby and headed upstairs, which was where he was prior to our
               contacting him. Around this point Kuhrt came out of the
               apartment where he and I spoke about what we had learned. Kuhrt
               told me the information he had obtained from Alicia matched
               what I had learned from Boudar. Shortly after speaking with
               Kuhrt I returned to speak with Boudar, while Kuhrt returned to
               speak with Alicia. Boudar and I discussed different options on
               how to deal with the tension in the house to include counseling
               services. He told me that was one of his conditions before he
               was going to return from Texas, but that Alicia's schedule had

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 041614 around 2235 hrs Ofc Chamberlin
               of the Pullman Police Department was dispatched to a report of
               a hit and run collision on Colorado St near Munchyz. The
               vehicle which had left the scene was described as a White
               Mitsubishi Lancer and was said to have been heading towards
               Stadium Wy. Sgt Griffin and I located a vehicle (Wa AOR7591),
               which matched the suspect vehicle, on Stadium Way near Wilson
               Rd. I turned around and began to follow the vehicle Southbound
               on Stadium Way and was told the vehicle had backed into a
               parked vehicle before leaving. As I looked at the vehicle I
               could not see any obvious signs of damage and followed the
               vehicle before it stopped in the Chevron gas station on East
               Main St where I contacted the driver. I asked the driver, later
               identified as Megan A Loman (012895), if she had been on
               Colorado St a short time ago. Loman was visibly nervous and
               would not look at me as I was talking to her. She told Griffin,
               who had also arrived around this point, that she had been on
               Colorado St near Munchyz. Before I could ask her anything else
               Loman told us she had backed into a vehicle at that location.
               She went on to tell us she had been scared and didn't know what
               to do before leaving. She continued and explained that she had
               recently had someone hit her vehicle, which was how the paint
               on the rear bumper had been chipped, and her boyfriend had just
               broke up with her. While I was talking to Loman, Griffin
               advised Whitcom that we had located the vehicle and Ofc Lambley
               responded a short time later. Before Lambley arrived I asked
               Loman for her drivers license, registration, and proof of
               insurance. Loman did not have her drivers license on her, but
               showed me her WSU Student ID card, and I obtained the necessary
               information from her to check her drivers status. She also
               provided me with her current registration and proof of
               insurance. Lambley arrived around this point and Griffin and I
               told her what we had been told. I gave her Loman's registration

               were dispatched to assist Pullman Police with a burglary in
               progress. Dispatch advised that Puffin Glass on South Grande
               had been broken into and the owner was watching, via security

               Pullman officers knocked and announced, but no one came out.
               They announced over the vehicle PA several times, but no one
               responded. After several hours the Whitman County Regional SWAT
               Team responded. They entered and searched the building. No one
               was found inside. At approximately 0820 hours we were released
               from the scene. Nothing further............... I certify and
