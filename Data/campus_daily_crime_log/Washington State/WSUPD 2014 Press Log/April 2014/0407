               Boyle (12/09/59). Boyle told me someone had struck the man lift
               with an unknown piece of construction equipment. The incident
               happened between March 14, 2014 and March 24, 2014. Boyle
               reported the damage to the general contractor, Hoffman
               Construction. He said his insurance company needed a police
               report for the incident. Boyle showed me the damaged basket.
               One side of the basket supports were bent. There was an obvious
               dented area where it was struck. I photographed the basket.
               Boyle said damage is estimated at $9600.00. It is unknown who
               or what damaged the man lift. The man lift is owned by Inland
               Glass Glazing Contractors. Boyle is the Glazing Manager for the
               company. Boyle provided me an electronic copy of his incident
               report that he filled out for Hoffman Construction. I have
               attached it to the case. The lift is described as: MODEL: A60J

               at approximately 1657 hours I was en route to another call when
               Ofc. Olmstead informed me that a suicide attempt was in
               progress at Perham Hall. I diverted and headed to Perham Hall.
               RED Hoodless was calling in saying Kuiokalani K. Hug (120994)
               was intoxicated and suicidal. Hug had apparently exited the
               building and was in front of the Hall. Ofc. Olmstead and I
               arrived and saw Hug dressed as described and he looked
               inebriated. He swayed as he stood and had droopy eyes. Hug
               appeared to be under 21. I approached him and asked him to sit
               down and he slurred that he wanted to be arrested. I asked him
               what he had done and he said he was an alcoholic. He was
               detained and placed in handcuffs. I advised him that he had the
               right to an attorney and that he did not have to speak with us.
               He was sat down on the grass. When I asked him what the problem
               was he said "I hate life". I then read him his Miranda rights
               and he said he understood them. He provided a breath sample of
               .234 on my PBT. Hug stated "I hate my life, I want to kill
               myself, let's go". He stated the date was 10-9-2007. I informed
               him he was in protective custody. Medics arrived and I informed
               them he was in protective custody. Medics got him into the
               ambulance and onto a gurney. He was restrained as he became
               uncooperative and attempted to bite a medic. I informed Hug we
               were being recorded. I rode with Medics to PRH. During the ride
               Hug was verbally abusive of the medics. Hug repeatedly said he
               wanted to kill himself. He asked me to "stab him with a knife".
               He told one medic "I'll fuck you up". To the same medic he said
               he would kill him one day. Hug stated he had been trying to
               committ suicide since he was 6 years old. Hug told me he wanted
               to "fucking beat your (my) ass". We arrived at the hospital and
               he was placed in restraints. He continued to be verbally
               abusive to staff. I completed the Protective Custody form and
               had Dr. Bergman sign it. I made a copy and left PRH the
               original. I later returned to the station and scanned a copy of
               the Protective Custody form. It is in the Files of this case.
               Ofc. Olmstead spoke with both the Hall Director and Hug's
               mother. See he supplement for details. I emailed day shift to
               see if they could go by Hugs room in the morning to talk to his

               ____NO OTHER UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 01-31-2011 at about 1616
               hrs I was dispatched to a burglary alarm at Holland Library,
               located at 1400 NE Terrell Mall. The alarm location was
               described as basement door, north stairwell. Based on the alarm
               information, it appears that a library patron had attempted to
               exit the library through the door and activated the alarm. I
               responded to the outside of the building near the exit door,
               but did not observe any suspicious activity. I called the
               library circulation desk and inquired about the alarm. I was
               told that library staff had already checked the area, and the
               alarm had been reset. No further law enforcement assistance was
               needed, and I cleared the scene. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this ____ day of
               _____________, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.
