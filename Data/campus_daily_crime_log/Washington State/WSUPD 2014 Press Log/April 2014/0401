               approximately 1025 hours, I was dispatched to a report of
               Malicious Mischief to the Hillside Cafe lanudry room window.
               Upon arrival, I contacted Jeff Wold who showed me the window in
               the laundry room leading to the Wilmer Davis courtyard. I
               noticed that the window was broken from the hinges, but the
               glass was not broken. I checked the window from the outside and
               saw a large paver concrete block laying on the ground outside
               the window. I noticed it appeared it was thrown into the window
               two times, denting the window sill and scratching the glass. I
               took photographs of the damage and estimated the cost to repair
               the window at approximately 700.00. It didn't appear that the
               person gained access to the building because there were no
               marks in the dust on top of the washers and driers inside the
               window. While checking on the window in the courtyard, I was
               contacted by Hannah T. Stewardson who lives in Wilmer Hall. She
               told me that between 0130 and 0200 hours, she woke to some loud
               banging outside her window in the courtyard. She looked outside
               and saw a single male running from the courtyard in a hooded
               sweatshirt. She told me she didn't see his face. Stewardson was
               unable to identify the male. Case inactive pending further
               leads. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the
               laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 1st day of April, 2014, in Pullman,

               the intersection of Stadium Way and NE N. Fairway Drive.
               Gabriela Godinez was transported to PRH for possible injuries
               to her head and right arm. NARRATIVE: On 040114 at
               approximately 1135 hours, I was dispatched to an injury
               collision at the intersection of Stadium Way and NE N. Fairway
               Drive. Upon arrival, I found two vehicles had collided in the
               middle of Stadium Way at the intersection of NE N. Fairway
               Drive, and several people were standing around a female who was
               laying on a bench near the sidewalk of the intersection. I
               contacted Gabriela Godinez-Castillo who was laying on the
               bench. Godinez told me she hit her head and she couldn't feel
               her right arm. I kept talking to Godinez and she told me she
               couldn't remember if she was wearing her seatbelt or not.
               Pullman Fire Department responded and placed Godinez on a
               stretcher. I contacted Iobani Godinez who told me he was
               driving Gabriela to school. She was in the front passenger
               seat. They were stopped on NE N. Fairway Drive waiting to make
               a left turn onto Stadium Way. Iobani told me he saw a Pullman
               Transit Bus approach the intersection signalling to make a
               right hand turn onto NE N. Fairway Drive from the outside NB
               lane of Stadium Way. Iobani told me he forgot that Stadium Way
               was a 4 lane road and pulled out to make the left turn as the
               bus was turning right onto N. Fairway Drive. As he pulled out,
               he pulled in front of Jasper Chamber's Dodge Pickup traveling
               NB in the inside lane of travel on Stadium Way. Iobani told me
               he was wearing his seatbelt, and that he wasn't sure about
               Gabriela. I contacted Chambers and his front passenger, Justin
               Kimsey. Chambers and Kimsey told me that they were driving in
               the inside lane of travel and as the bus began its right turn,
               Chambers told me he slowed down to approximately 20 MPH. As he
               passed the bus, he saw Iobani's blue car pull out. Chambers
               stated he slammed on his brakes, but was so close to Iobani's
               car, the brakes did little to slow his pickup before impact.
               All parties provided me with their driver's license,
               registration and insurance and I completed an information
               exchange process in Sector for Iobani and Chambers. I also
               completed an infraction for Iobani for failing to yield to the
               right of way of Chambers causing a collision. I explained the

               photos of the scene and attached them to the case. Both
               vehicles were towed from the scene. Iobani's vehicle was towed
               to Myers Auto Rebuild and Towing and Autobody Supercenter towed
               Chamber's pickup. Nothing further. I certify and declare under

               them. At approximately 1600 hours, Kurle told me he thought he
               removed all the fliers. Nothing further. I certify and declare

               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: SYNOPSIS: Subjects vehicle was struck
               while parked in the lower level of the Holland Library Parking
               garage between 0800 and 1300 hours on 3/31/14. NAME/DOB:

               WSU STUDENT: ____YES ____NO OTHER UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On
               4/1/14 at about 1510 hours Abigail Anderson came to the station
               to report her vehicle, OR/299BZP, had been struck while parked
               unoccupied. Anderson said she parked her vehicle in the lower
               level of the Holland Library parking garage on 3/31/14 at about
               0800 hours. At about 1300 hours Nathaniel Lucier, a friend,
               drives Anderson's vehicle to Anderson's apartment in Providence
               Court. At 1400 hours Lucier returns to the Holland Library
               parking garage to pick up Anderson, and this is when Anderson
               sees the damage to her vehicle's left rear passenger door. The
               damage appears to be a ten inch dent with a small scrape, and
               white paint transfer. The damage was viewed from pictures
               Anderson had taken with her phone. Anderson had not brought the
               vehicle to the station. Anderson seemed positive the damage
               occurred in the Holland Library parking garage. She said she
               was sure the damage was not there when she parked her vehicle
               in the garage at 0800 hours. When her friend, Lucier, drove the
               vehicle back to her apartment he parked in her assigned spot
               which has posts on both sides of it which would have prevented
               the damage from occurring there. Lucier, who had came to the
               department with Anderson, stated he had not parked Anderson's
               vehicle any other place other than her Providence Court
               assigned parking spot. Anderson said she did not report the
               damage earlier because she had been to busy. It was not until
               she talked to her Mom it was decided to report it to the
               police. At this time there are no suspects or leads. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.

               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W1267 SYNOPSIS: A male WSU student
               was taken into Protective Custody and transported to Pullman
               Regional Hospital for a Mental Health evaluation. NAME/DOB:

               ____NO OTHER UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 04-01-14, at
               approximately 1823 hours, I was dispatched to Olympia Hall for
               a Suicidal subject. The "On Call" RED for Olympia Hall, Sarah
               Alrashoodi, called Whitcom stating she had been contacted by a
               female WSU student stating her ex-boyfriend left her a note
               leading her to believe he was going to commit suicide. The male
               in question was Joshua M. Watkins (04-27-94). Watkins was
               described as being 6 feet tall and weighing approximately 160
               pounds. He was said to have been wearing a black t-shirt and
               black pants when he left Olympia Hall. It was unclear as to
               where he was going. I responded to Olympia Hall while Officer
               Petlovany attempted to contact Verizon Wireless to see if they
               could track Watkins' cell phone. When I contacted Alrashoodi in
               Olympia Hall, she showed me a note Watkins had written to his
               ex-girlfriend, Hali Brunck (08-22-95). The note led me to
               believe Watkins intended to end his life as he and Brunck had
               apparently broken up. As I was speaking to Alrashoodi about the
               incident, an unidentified male came into the office stating he
               had just received a text from Watkins stating he was sitting on
               a bench, near the art, on Stadium Way. I relayed this
               information to Officers Welter and Petlovany. A few moments
               later, Officer Petlovany called out with Watkins. Officer
               Welter checked out with Officer Petlovany a few moments later.
               I informed Alrashoodi Officers had found Watkins and I would be
               responding to their location. She asked we call their Hall
               Staff when Watkins was released. I responded and met Officers
               Petlovany and Welter. Officer Petlovany informed me Watkins had
               told him he intended to hurt himself. I explained to Watkins
               after reading the note he wrote to Brunck he intended to hurt
               himself. He initially said he did not want anyone to help him,
               but eventually agreed to go the Pullman Regional Hospital for a
               Mental Health evaluation. I transported Watkins to the Hospital
               without incident. Watkins was seen by Tim Freson, who works for
               WSU Health and Wellness Services. Freson said he is concerned
               for Watkins, but he does not meet the criteria to mandatorily
               admit him into the Hospital. He said he and Watkins came up
               with a 48 hour safety plan in which Watkins promised not to

               harm himself. Watkins told Freson he would go to the WSU
               Counseling and Testing Services Center as well as WSU Health
               and Wellness Services on 04-02-14. Once Watkins was released I
               gave him a courtesy transport back to Olympia Hall. I walked
               him to his room and asked his roommate, Andrew M. Slattery (05-
               17-95). I told Slattery I could not tell him exactly what was
               going on with Watkins, but asked him if he planned on being
               home all night. He said he did so I asked him if he would be
               willing to keep an eye on Watkins. I said he was having a hard
               time dealing with the brake up of he and his ex-girlfriend. I
               asked him to please call 911 if he became concerned about
               Watkins and he said he would. I called Alrashoodi and informed
               her Watkins was back in Olympia Hall. Once back at the WSU
               Police Department I scanned the "Release of Adult Protective
               Custody" form and the note Watkins wrote to his ex-girlfriend
               into the WSU Police Computer System and attached it to the case
               file. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 1st day of April,
               2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 04/01/14 at approximately 1945 hours
               I was working at the CUB senior ball room for the Paradiso
               concert when Intern Sorensen radioed he needed an Officer at
               the Men's bathroom for an issue concerning drugs. I walked over
               to the bathroom and saw Intern Sorensen and a male, later
               identified as Yazdanmehr Ovissi 04/03/94, exiting the bathroom.
               Intern Sorensen had a small ziplock bag containing one capsule.
               Inside the clear capsule was a white powder. Intern Sorensen
               stated that he was checking the bathrooms when he saw three
               males standing next to the sinks. The three started to leave
               the bathroom and he saw Ovissi had a plastic bag in his hand.
               Intern Sorensen asked Ovissi what he had in his hand. Ovissi
               opened his hand and showed Intern Sorensen the ziplock bag
               containing the one capsule. I asked Ovissi what was in the
               capsule. Ovissi said he found the pill on the dance floor. I
               asked Ovissi why he picked it up and went to the bathroom with
               it. Ovissi said he did not know. I again asked what was in the
               pill. Ovissi said, "it's probably molly." Ovissi did not have
               his ID with him but provided his information verbally. I
               confirmed Ovissi's information thought dispatch and told him
               that I would be sending the capsule off to the state crime lab
               for analysis. Assuming that the capsule contained a controlled
               substance, I would be forwarding charges to the prosecutor.
               Ovissi said he understood. I told Ovissi that he was being
               trespassed from the CUB for the remainder of the night but he
               was free to return in the morning. I walked Ovissi out of the
               CUB. The capsule was logged into evidence and marked to be sent
               to the crime lab. Pending the results from the lab, charges of
               possession of a controlled substance will be forwarded to the
               prosecutor. Intern Sorensen filled out a statement form that
               was added to the case file. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the

               NARRATIVE: On 04-01-14 I was dispatched to an Others Call. The
               R/P a Miranda Samberg wanted phone contact concerning a Kacey
               Martinelli. I called her and she told me the following. She
               stated that last year she and a Kacey Martinelli had a
               disagreement. There was a report filed Case #13-W4344. When she
               filed the report she was told to call if she saw Marinelli on
               campus. She stated that she thought she saw Martinelli on
               campus today. She went to her residence hall and spoke to hall
               staff. They told her to call the police so she did. I asked her
               if Martinelli spoke to her and she said "No, I dont even know
               if it was her. It just looked like her." Samberg said she had
               heard rumors that Martinelli is living in Stimson Hall with her
               boyfriend, but doesn't know his name. I told Samberg that if
               she found out the name or where she was located to let me know
               and I would advise Stimson Hall Staff. She thanked me and we
               ended the call. I checked Zussis and Martinelli is not a
               current student. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this ____ day of _____________,
               2014, in Pullman, Washington.
