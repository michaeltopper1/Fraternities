               (06-16-94) came to the WSU Police Department stating either she
               or her friend turned a Human Development text book in to the

               OTHER UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 04-29-14, at approximately 1539
               hours, Oletta N. Adjetey (06-16-94), came to the WSU Police
               Department to report he Human Development text book had been
               stolen. She apparently told Cpl. Edwards two different versions
               of what occurred. She originally stated her friend turned the
               text book in to the CUB Information Desk approximately 1 month
               ago (03-29-14). She said she went to the CUB Information Desk
               today (04-29-14) to retrieve the text book and was told it was
               not there. She then apparently changed her story stating SHE
               had turned the text book in to the CUB Information Desk
               approximately 1 month ago because her hands were full. She said
               she told the CUB staff she would be back to retrieve the text
               book the next day and said she did not have time. Cpl. Edwards
               was scheduled to end her shift at 1600 hours, so she came to
               brief Swing Shift regarding the case. As I was about to go to
               the Police Department lobby to contact Adjetey, I got a phone
               call from our front desk stating she had left because she
               apparently had class. On 04-29-14, I called the WSU book store
               to see if I could get a copy of the text books Adjetey had
               purchased and/or sold back to the book store as of 04-29-14. I
               was told the book store had recently transferred to a different
               software system so they were not sure if the requested
               information could be gathered. I was told they would research
               the information and get back with me. More to follow. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.

               NARRATIVE: On 04/29/14 at approximately 2313 hours I was parked
               against the southern curb of Terre View Drive facing eastbound
               monitoring traffic. I noticed a white Lexus sedan heading
               southbound down the hill of Northwood Drive. The Lexus appeared
               to be traveling faster than the 25 MPH zone and I activated my
               handheld radar (Decatur Scout 2013). I obtained a reading of 36
               MPH. Once the Lexus reached the intersection of Northwood and
               Terre View, the Lexus turned right onto westbound Terre View.
               Once the Lexus passed me, I turned around and initiated a
               traffic stop. I contacted the driver, Zijue Wang 03/22/93,
               identified myself, informed the driver I was recording, and
               asked the driver if he knew why I had stopped him. Wang said he
               did not and I explained the reason for the stop. I asked Wang
               for his driver's license, vehicle registration, and proof of
               insurance which he provided. I returned to my patrol car and
               ran Wang through dispatch. Dispatch stated that Wang was
               suspended in the 3rd degree through Washington. I walked back
               up to Wang and asked him to exit his car which he did. I told
               Wang that he was under arrest for driving on a suspended
               license and handcuffed (D/L) him. I advised Wang of his right
               to counsel. About this time Ofc. Petlovany arrived on scene. I
               searched Wang incident to arrest and found no weapons or
               illegal items. I placed Wang in the backseat of my patrol car
               and asked Wang if it was ok with him if Ofc. Petlovany adjusted
               his car so it would be legally parked. Wang said that was fine.
               Ofc. Petlovany parked Wang's car and secured the car. I
               transported Wang to the Pullman Holding Facility where he was
               fingerprinted and photographed. I issued Wang Sector citation
               4Z0407195 for RCW 46.20.342.1C driving while license suspended
               in the 3rd degree. I explained the citation to Wang and
               provided him with his copy. Wang was released from custody and
               I cleared. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 30th day of April,
               2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               NARRATIVE: On 042914 at approximately 2334 hours I was driving
               westbound on Grimes Way near the fuel pumps when I saw a female
               walking on the sidewalk with a longboard. It seemed odd that
               she would be heading out that way at that time of night. I
               continued on and when I got the intersection of Stadium Way I
               saw a male on a longboard in the Fine Arts garage. I then saw 3
               more males eziting the garage carrying or pushing longboards. 3
               of the males were Ivan Sanchez Velazquez (062695), Jesus M.
               Mora Zambrano (120190), Juan A. Aguilar Quintero (092592). The
               other was unidentified. I got out and contacted them, informing
               them they could not longboard/skateboard in the parking garages
               and that they had to be on the sidewalks. Mora Zambrano
               appeared to be offended that I told dispatch that I was with
               skateboarders and not longboarders. I cleared and saw the group
               head east down Grimes on the sidewalk. It occurred to me that
               maybe the female I had seen earlier was heading to the east end
               of Grimes to ride in the roadway and that these 4 were going to
               meet her. I looped around to the east end of Grimes and parked
               at the Cattle Feed Laboratory. Shortly after I saw the light of
               Aguilar Quintero's longboard coming down the road, not on the
               sidewalk. I then saw other riders weaving back and forth in the
               roadway. Then I saw the headlights of a vehicle behind them. It
               appeared to be moving very slowly. I called for another unit
               and drove forward to contact them. I stopped at the crosswalk
               by Food Services with my emergency lights activated. The
               vehicle continued by me and stopped a short distance away. The
               3 longboarders, Ivan Sanchez Velazquez (062695), Jesus M. Mora
               Zambrano (120190), Juan A. Aguilar Quintero (092592), were
               getting onto the sidewalk. I began to explain again that they
               had to be on the sidewalk and not in the roadway. I asked for
               Aguilar Quintero's identification and he asked why. Mora
               Zambrano was questioning why bikes could be in the roadway and
               why he could not be. I explained that he was considered a
               pedestrian. He asked for the RCW and I told him I did not know

               the number off the top of my head but instructed him on how he
               could Google it. I went to address Aguilar Quintero and Mora
               Zambrano turned and walked away towards the vehicle. I said
               "Hey come here, I told you to come here right now". He
               continued walking to the vehicle. He asked if he was detained
               and I told him he was. I told him to come back over to the area
               where his friends were as the vehicle was still and unknown to
               me. I warned him he was about to be arrested for obstructiong.
               Ofc. Kirshner arrived on scene just as this was happening. I
               told him to get on the ground repeatedly. I had my hand on his
               left arm as I was about to effect an arrest. He then complied
               and sat on the ground. He asked why he was being detained and I
               reiterated the issue. Mora Zambrano then said that whenever he
               interacts with the Police that we always "hammer" him. He said
               we never contact anybody else, only him. I then identified Mora
               Zambrano and had Ofc. Kirshner do the same for the others. None
               of them provided an issued identification. They were confirmed
               with either last 4 of SSN or knowledge of their license.
               However, Mora Zambrano refused to confirm his SSN. He felt that
               when I asked for his last 4, which is a common practice, I was
               asking for other reasons. I learned that the vehicle was driven
               by one of their friends and I told the driver he could wait
               down the road for them. He complied. I explained to them that
               the vehicle seemed to be a willing participant in the activity
               and they would not be charged with Disorderly Conduct. Mora
               Zambrano asked if I had wanted to punch him. He then insinuated
               that every time he engages with the Police he gets punched. He
               continued to talk about how a Police Officer "almost pulled a
               gun" on him. I highlighted the difference in his behavior and
               that of his friends. He did not understand the "concept". I had
               seen Aguilar Quintero had been recording us and tried not being
               obvious. I told him he was fine to record as I was too. Mora
               Zambrano said that we would take our recording and "just muffle
               it out in the back room". I told him he could believe what he
               wanted to. Mora Zambrano then said he would not argue with me
               anymore as it was "apparent" and repeated it. He would not
               elaborate. I told Mora Zambrano he would be referred to Student
               Conduct. They were free to go and we cleared. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               30th day of April, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.
