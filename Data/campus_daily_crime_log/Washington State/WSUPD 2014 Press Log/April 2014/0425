               was investigating a graffiti trail in the area of Gannon Hall
               when I noticed more graffiti that was unrelated to the original

               paint on the walls on the 5th floor north stairwell of Gannon
               Hall. The graffiti read, "#same love, #5th Hash Rules, # Tag, #
               Swag, and some illegible spray paint graffiti. I took pictures
               of the damage. I have no idea who may have caused the damage.
               The last time I know there was no damage to the walls of Gannon

               at approximately 1515 hours Assistant Chief Hansen came upon a
               non-injury collision on NE Stadium at NE Wilson Rd. Ofc. Jones
               and I responded. Upon arrival Ofc. Jones photographed the scene
               and I interviewed the drivers. Cameron Radka said he was
               stopped at the intersection of Stadium Way and Wilson Rd facing
               southbound in the inside lane (closest to center). Radka said
               his light had changed green, but there were still pedestrians
               so he did not drive forward. Radka said he was rear ended by
               the car behind him driven by Aaron Line. Radka said he was not
               injured. I spoke with Line and he told me he was traveling
               southbound on Stadium Way at Wilson Rd. Line said he was
               looking out his driver's side window at the carnival on Wilson
               Rd. Line said he did not see Radka stopped in front of him and
               rear ended him. Line said he was not injured. Line had a
               passenger, Francisco Perez Jimenez, who also stated he was not
               injured. There was extensive damage to the front of Line's
               vehicle and it had to be towed from the scene (owner preference
               Auto Body Super Center). I facilitated an exchange of
               information. I completed a PTCR and Ofc. Jones saved the photos
               to the case. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 26th day of April, 2014 in

               NARRATIVE: On 04/26/14 at about 0012 hrs I heard Cougar
               Security advise of a possible fight in progress at Streit Hall.
               As I was responding Cougar Security said they saw two of the
               subjects go inside Streit Hall. The third subject was still
               standing outside the building. As I arrived the third subject,
               later identified as Stuart L. Pritchard (012395), flagged me
               down. I asked what was going on and he said " I almost got my
               ass whooped by some homies". When I asked who they were he said
               "I'm not trying to rat them out like that". I asked why he was
               flagging me down if he didn't want to tell me what happened and
               who was involved and he said because they just left. I asked
               who and he said he was not going to tell me. All he would say
               was there was a previous fight a couple weeks prior between the
               same two people and he (Pritchard) got his "shit rocked". He
               said both fights were due to "drunk bullshit". As I was
               speaking to Pritchard I could smell the odor of intoxicants on
               his breath and noticed he had bloodshot and watery eyes.
               Pritchard had some small abrasions on his left forearm and I
               could see several small drops of blood on his shirt. Pritchard
               said he was ok and was not in need of medical attention. I told
               Pritchard if he changed his mind and wanted to tell me more
               about what happened or who was involved to call the police
               department. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 26 day of

               NARRATIVE: On 04/26/14 at about 0047 hrs I was driving
               eastbound on Colorado St. when I noticed a female who was
               walking eastbound along Colorado St. She caught my attention
               because she appeared to be under the age of 21 and was having
               difficulty walking, stumbling side to side. I also noticed she
               had dirt smeared down her right arm as well as a small amount
               of blood on her right knee, indicating she fell down at one
               point. I initially pulled into the lower Interfaith House
               parking lot off Colorado St. but when the female, later
               identified as Raina H. Lemire (092795), saw me turn into the
               parking lot she crossed Colorado St. and started walking down D
               St. I drove down D Street and contacted Lemire next to the
               lower soccer field. I asked Lemire where she was going and she
               said home. I asked if she was ok because it looked like she
               fell down and she said she was fine and did not need any
               medical attention. As I spoke to Lemire I could smell the odor
               of intoxicants on her breath. I asked how much she had to drink
               and she admitted to having had a couple beers. I asked how old
               she was and she said 19. She provided me with her name and date
               of birth because she did not have ID with her. I confirmed the
               information through dispatch. I asked Lemire if I could check
               her eyes to see how much alcohol was in her system. She agreed
               and I administered a horizontal gaze nystagmus test on her. I
               observed a lack of smooth pursuit and a distinct and sustained
               nystagms at maximum deviation in both eyes. I told Lemire I
               would be forwarding the incident to student conduct. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 26 day of April, 2014, in Pullman,

               hours, I was traveling west bound on Colorado St when I
               observed a group of males walking on the south side sidewalk. I
               observed one of the males, later identified as Aman Afework,
               carrying a beer in his left hand. As I began to pass the group,
               Aman appeared to be trying to hide the can. I pulled into the
               Old Bookie parking lot off of Colorado St and as I did, I saw
               Aman toss the can into the grass. I exited my vehicle,
               activated my Axon camera, and told Aman I would like to speak
               with him about the can he just threw in the grass. I advised
               the other males they could leave and they did. I asked Aman
               about the beer and he denied having it and began to argue with
               me for a minute. I advised him I saw him carrying it and
               watched him throw it to the ground. I asked him for his
               identification and he provided a KS Driver's License. I asked
               him if he was from Pullman and he said no. He advised me he was
               attending Bellevue College. I asked him to provide me his
               address and he did. I asked him why he was walking around with
               an open container and he said he had just left one place and
               was going to another. I explained open container laws to him as
               well MIP to him and he stated he understood. I had him go back
               to the can and pour out the contents. The can seemed to be
               about 1/4 full of Busch Light beer. I advised him I would be
               forwarding charges to the PA's office and it would be up to
               them if he was charged. He stated he understood. I had him
               throw the beer can away in a garbage can. I cleared. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the

               limit. I activated my police traffic radar unit (VH 7) which
               emitted a high pitched audio doppler tone that was increasing
               in pitch. I observed a top speed of 37 MPH before the vehicle
               began slowing down abruptly, presumably because they saw my
               vehicle approaching. The suspect vehicle was the only moving
               vehicle in the radar field at the time of the speed readings.
               The calibration of the radar unit was checked both before and
               after the stop by the use of factory certified tuning forks.
               The radar unit was found to be in proper working condition. I
               turned around and initiated a traffic stop on the vehicle,
               turning on my overhead lights. The vehicle stopped on Colorado
               St. near Bohler Gym. I contacted the driver, later identified
               as Ernesto Orozco Gonzalez (021294), and told him the reason
               for the stop and the stop was being recorded. I asked Orozco
               Gonzalez for his vehicle registration, proof of insurance, and
               driver's license. He provided the requested information. I
               noticed Orozco Gonzalez's driver's license indicated he was
               under the age of 21. As I spoke to Orozco Gonzalez I could
               smell a strong odor of intoxicants emitting from the vehicle. I
               asked him to exit the vehicle and move to the sidewalk so I
               could speak with him and he did so. I asked Orozco Gonzalez how
               much he had to drink and he admitted to having had 2 or 3
               beers. I asked if he would be willing to perform some voluntary
               field sobriety tests so I could make sure he was not impaired
               and he said he would. The tests were administered on the
               sidewalk near Bohler Gym. The area chosen was straight and
               level. Orozco Gonzalez was wearing tennis shoes, jeans, and a
               sweatshirt. The approximate temperature was 41 degrees. I told
               Orozco Gonzalez I would be evaluating him based on how well he
               performed on the tests as well as how well he followed my
               instructions. The first test I administered was the horizontal

               gaze nystagmus test. I told Orozco Gonzalez to stand with his
               feet together and his arms at his sides. I told him to follow
               the tip of my pen with his eyes only and not to move his head.
               He said he understood. I confirmed Orozco Gonzalez's pupils
               were of equal size and his eyes tracked equally. I observed
               Orozco Gonzalez had bloodshot and watery eyes, a lack of smooth
               pursuit, a distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum
               deviation, and an onset of nystagmus prior to 45 degrees. The
               second test I administered was the nine step walk and turn. I
               told Orozco Gonzalez to imagine a straight line down the
               sidewalk. I told him to place his left foot on the line and
               then put his right foot in front of his left, touching heel to
               toe. I told him to keep his arms at his sides and to remain in
               this position while I explained the rest of the test. I told
               him not to begin the test until instructed to do so. Orozco
               Gonzalez said he understood my instructions. I told Orozco
               Gonzalez to take nine steps, touching heel to toe down the
               imaginary straight line. I told him to look at his feet the
               entire time, count each step out loud, and keep his arms at his
               sides. I told him once he reached his ninth step to leave his
               front foot in place and to take a series of small steps with
               his back foot to turn around. I told him to take nine more
               steps back down the same imaginary straight line. I reminded
               Orozco Gonzalez to keep his arms at his sides, look at his feet
               the entire time, count each step out loud, and to touch each
               step heel to toe. I told him it was a continuous test and once
               he started not to stop until he completed the test. I
               demonstrated the test and Orozco Gonzalez said he understood.
               As I was explaining the test Orozco Gonzalez was unable to
               maintain his balance and stepped out of the starting position
               once. During his first nine steps he stepped offline to his
               right on step 5/6 and raised his arms for balance. He took 10
               steps in his first nine steps. Orozco Gonzalez moved both feet
               to turn. He stepped offline to his left on step 9/10 during his
               second nine steps and took 10 steps in his second nine steps.
               The third test I administered was the one leg stand. I told
               Orozco Gonzalez to stand with his feet together and his arms at
               his sides. I told him to remain in this position while I
               explained the test and not to begin until instructed to do so.
               I told him when instructed to begin to choose one foot,
               whichever he was most comfortable with, and lift it so his toe
               was approximately six inches off the ground. I told him to
               point his toe so the bottom of his foot was parallel with the
               ground and to keep both legs straight. I told him to keep his
               arms at his sides and to look at his toe. I told him to count
               out loud by 1000's (1001, 1002, 1003 and so on) until
               instructed to stop. I told him if at any point in time he put
               his foot down to pick it right back up and continue where he
               left off. I demonstrated the test and Orozco Gonzalez said he
               understood my instructions. Orozco Gonzalez chose to stand on
               his right foot, raising his left. He put his foot down on his
               count of 1002. On his count of 1005 I reminded him to look at
               his toe because he was looking into the distance. On his count
               of 1010 he raised his arms and used them for balance throughout
               the rest of the test. He counted to 1023 in 30 seconds. I asked

               Orozco Gonzalez if he would be willing to provide a voluntary
               breath sample on a PBT. He began rambling about how he was
               concerned he might get kicked out of school etc and never gave
               me an answer. I told Orozco Gonzalez he was under arrest for
               minor operating a motor vehicle after consuming alcohol and
               placed him in handcuffs (double locked). I advised him of his
               right to remain silent and his right to an attorney. Orozco
               Gonzalez gave permission for his vehicle to be moved to a legal
               parking spot. I transported Orozco Gonzalez to the Pullman PD
               holding facility. I read him his Constitutional Rights from the
               DUI packet at 0127 hrs and he signed stating they were read to
               him. He also signed stating he was waiving his rights. I began
               reading him his implied consent warning for breath and he had
               several questions about how being arrested related to school. I
               offered to contact an attorney for him and he said that would
               be good. I contacted the on call public defender and allowed
               Orozco Gonzalez to speak with him until I saw he hung up the
               phone. I checked Orozco Gonzalez's mouth at 0144 hrs and found
               no foreign substances. I read Orozco Gonzalez his implied
               consent warning for breath at 0147 hrs and he signed stating
               so. I asked if he would submit to a breath test and he said
               "Yes". I had him initial next to the yes box on the DUI packet.
               I asked if he was confused by the implied consent warnings and
               he said "No". I had him initial next to the no box on the DUI
               packet. I asked Orozco Gonzalez the questions from the DUI
               packet. He told me he had been drinking beer at a friends
               apartment. He admitted to drinking 2 or 3 beers starting at
               1245 pm and finishing at 1230 pm. When asked if he believed his
               ability to drive was affected by his alcohol usage he said,
               "No". I waited for the 15 minute observation period to pass. I
               checked the Datamaster Instrument and found it in proper
               working order with the RFI antenna attached, breath tube warm
               to the touch, and temperature display showing 34.00 degrees.
               Orozco Gonzalez provided a breath sample of .167 at 0205 hrs
               and a second sample of .169 at 0207 hrs. The breath test was
               administered in accordance with the methods approved by the
               Washington State Toxicologist pursuant to the Washington
               Administrative Code. I provided Orozco Gonzalez with a copy of
               the following documents: driver's hearing request, notice of
               hearing/conditions of release, and breath test document. I
               placed him in a holding cell while I completed paperwork. I
               later returned and issued criminal citation #4Z0436956 for DUI.
               I explained the citation to him, he received his copy, and was
               released. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 26 day of April,
               2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               to Perham Hall for the report of a female having a window
               punched into her face. The suspects had left the area and the
               female was in her room on the first floor. I arrived and took
               photographs of the window which had been broken. It was on the
               west side of the building near the rear entrance off of the
               parking lot in the back of the building that leads into the
               hallway attaching Perham Hall to the main complex. The window
               was approximately 6 feet in height by 3 feet in width. I took
               photographs of the window while Ofc. Boyd attempted to contact
               the victim/reporting party. As I was taking pictures, a male
               identified as Jordon Gerry, advised me he was hall staff and
               had witnessed the incident from his 4th floor room window. He
               stated he heard people arguing and after a few minutes, he
               looked out his window to see three females outside in a verbal
               altercation with some males inside the building. He said two
               subjects had also began walking towards the door from the
               parking lot. He said he stepped away from the window for a
               minute and then heard the glass break. When he stepped back to
               the window he saw the two who had just walked up, walk away and
               the female who had been yelling also walked away followed by
               one of the other females. He stated he heard the names Alyssa
               and Demetrius yelled during the incident. He said another
               female got into a vehicle and drove away. I thanked him for his
               information and I went up to Ofc. Boyd's location. When Ofc.
               Boyd was about to contact the female RP, he was summoned down
               the hall by hall staff who were with another female who was
               vomiting in the hallway. I checked to see if he needed any
               assistance and he said no. I had Whitcom contact the Housing
               Trouble Shooter to deal with the broken window. I then went
               down the hall to contact the RP and met with a female
               identified as Danielle Broussard by her Military ID. I asked
               her if I could record our conversation and she said yes, and I
               activated my Axon camera. Broussard stated she had been with

               her friend, Alyssa, when they came to the building. She said
               Alyssa had lost her card and they saw some people on the ground
               floor study and asked them to let them in. Alyssa knocked on
               the window and asked if they could let them in. She said one of
               them walked towards the door like they were going to open it
               and then they didn't. She said they began playing around and
               taunting them. Alyssa was yelling at them saying things like,
               "are you really not going to let us in". One of the males came
               up to the window and said you guys don't want to come in
               because, "we will beat your ass". She said there was a lot of
               "smack talking" going back and forth. Broussard said she
               believed there was four males and two girls inside. The girls
               had been in the lounge and it was mostly the males taunting
               them. At this point, Alyssa was close to the window and the
               male punched the window breaking into the Alyssa's face. The
               verbal argument continued and more threats were made by the
               male. He then punched what was left of the window, again in the
               direction of Alyssa. Broussard said she had been trying to get
               Alyssa to walk away while also trying to get another friend who
               was in her room to come open the door. The threats from the
               males continued and at one point one of them call Alyssa a
               "cunt". She said the females told them they needed to leave
               because the male would assault them. Alyssa eventually walked
               away, and the other female with them walked away with Alyssa,
               but Broussard didn't know if she went with Alyssa or went home.
               She said the group inside then stated they were leaving to go
               get something to eat. Broussard tried to ask them to not come
               outside until they had left. She said they continued to
               threaten to fight with them. I asked her to describe the male
               who hit the window and she said he was black and was wearing a
               red and gray sweatshirt. Tayvada Olson was in the hallway while
               I was speaking to Broussard. She stated she had come down to
               let Broussard and Alyssa in and found the group by the door.
               She said the male who Broussard said punched the window was
               extremely agitated and angry. She said she had just woken up
               and when she let Broussard inside and the male had spoken to
               her, but she wasn't really paying attention to him. She said
               she did not get his name, but he was very angry and was
               yelling. Alyssa then came up the hallway and I told her I was
               recording the conversation and asked her if that was okay and
               she said yes. I then spoke to Alyssa and she gave a similar
               account of the incident. She stated she had gotten verbal with
               the subjects and wasn't going to back down. I observed Alyssa
               was fairly intoxicated. We discussed better ways of handling
               the situation and she stated she understood. I looked at her
               injuries which were very small pinpoint spots on her forehead
               and cheek. I asked her if she wanted medical attention and she
               said no. As I was leaving I drove around the north side of
               Perham Hall and observed a group of subjects walking up to the
               door near the elevator. I observed one of the males was dressed
               exactly as described by Alyssa and Broussard. I exited my
               vehicle and asked the group to come talk to me. They looked at
               me and then began walking very quickly to the doors. I yelled,
               "Stop Police" and they began running. I attempted to catch up
               to them and the door shut before I could reach it. The intern

               with me, stated the group had gone up the stairs. I entered the
               building and started up the stairs, but there was no one in the
               stairwell. I was unsure where they had gone. As I was running
               up to the outside door, I could smell a strong odor of
               marijuana and continued to smell it in the stairwell, but it
               quickly dissipated. I was unable to find the group that ran. As
               I was looking, Whitcom advised the RA on duty was on 911
               stating she saw a female who had been with the group running
               from me, and with the male who punched the window earlier,
               running near the Beasley foot bridge. Ofc. Boyd went that
               direction to find the female. He caught up to her near Martin
               Stadium on Stadium Way. I responded to his location and
               activated my Axon camera. The female had told Ofc. Boyd she
               didn't have any identification and had identified herself as
               Mariah Warrick. I advised Warrick I was recording our
               conversation and she stated she understood. I could smell a
               very strong odor of intoxicants emitting from her breath as she
               spoke and her speech was slurred. Her eyes were also bloodshot,
               watery, and appeared sleepy. I advised her of her Miranda
               Warnings which I read from my department issued card. She
               stated she understood and would be willing to speak with me. I
               asked her MORE TO FOLLOW I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this ____ day of

               floor of Perham Hall to contact a possible witness in a
               malicious mischief case. When I arrived on the 1st floor hall
               staff flagged me down because there was a female, later
               identified as Tatianna M. Dixon (092695) who was passed out in
               the hallway. I could see Dixon was laying face down in the
               hallway with vomit around her head. As I approached Dixon tried
               to stand up and walk away. I could see she also had vomit on
               her shirt. I directed Dixon to sit down because she was having
               difficulty standing on her own. I asked Dispatch to send an
               ambulance to evaluate Dixon because she had been vomiting and
               was highly intoxicated. Pullman Ambulance personnel arrived and
               evaluated Dixon. It was determined she could stay with her
               sober friends. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 26 day of

               April 26, 2014 at about 0659 hours WSU Police were toned out to
               a burglary alarm at the WSU Fine Arts Museum. I responded to
               the building. There have been multiple false alarms at this
               location in the past day. The alarms have been caused by a
               moving art exhibit. I checked the museum, nothing was found.
               The art exhibit was moving causing the alarm to activate. I
               asked Whitcom to contact a responsible for the alarm. Whitcom
               called all the responsible's, but nobody answered their phones,
               messages were left. I was unable to reset the alarm as I didn't
               have the code and neither did Whitcom. I left the building and
               locked the doors. No further investigation. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               26th day of April, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.
