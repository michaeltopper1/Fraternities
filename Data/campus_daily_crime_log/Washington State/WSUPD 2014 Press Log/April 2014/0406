               NARRATIVE: On April 6, 2014 at about 0922 hours I was
               dispatched to Stephenson East for broken glass on the ground
               floor. I responded to the building where I found the main
               ground floor door damaged. The glass in the entry door had been
               broken sometime in the early morning hours on this date. The
               door is a double glass door. The door on the left or the north
               door had the damage to the glass. This is the main entry area
               where the card reader is located for Stephenson East. There was
               a rock lying on the ground near the the door. The brown rock
               was about the size of a baseball. It had sharp edges on it. I
               noticed brown discoloration on the impact areas of the clear
               glass door. It is plausible that an unknown person(s) used the
               rock to break the glass. The glass had shattered, but it did
               not fall out of the door frame. WSU Housing Maintenance had
               been called prior to my arrival. I photographed the damage. I
               estimate damage to be $500.00. According to the complainant
               Colby B.P. Cavanaugh (06/07/94). The door was intact at about
               0200 hours this morning. He received a text message at about
               0900 hours this morning notifying him that the glass was
               broken. Cavanaugh is an Resident Advisor for the building.
               There are no cameras in this area. At this time it is unknown
               who broke the glass and why they did it. There are no suspects,
               witnesses, or leads at this time. No further investigation. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 6th day of April, 2014, in Pullman,

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 04-06-2014 at about 1659 hrs I was
               dispatched to a report of malicious mischief at Daggy Hall,
               located at 1060 NE College Avenue. Dispatch advised that an
               exterior window in room #3 had been broken. I arrived on scene
               and located the broken window, which was at the south end of
               the long hallway outside room #3. I observed a small hole in
               the window and saw that the window pane was cracked. A
               rectangular section of the glass on one side of the hole had
               fallen to the ground. The glass around the puncture was pushed
               slightly inward, and it appeared as if a pointed object had
               struck the window pane with a high degree of force. I located a
               metal door latch (similar to a latch from a bathroom stall) on
               the floor underneath the broken window, along with glass
               fragments from the window pane. The latch was of the correct
               size and weight, that if thrown at the window, would have
               caused similar damage. Based on the positioning of the latch on
               the floor and the damage to the window, it is likely that the
               latch was thrown at the window, and the impact from the latch
               caused the damage to the glass window pane. I checked the
               hallways, bathrooms, and classrooms near the area of the broken
               window, but I could not determined where the door latch came
               from. I attempted to obtain latent fingerprints from the door
               latch, but was unsuccessful. The incident was reported by a WSU
               custodian working in the building. I determined that the window
               was broken on 04-06-2014 sometime between 0200 hrs and 1600
               hrs. The damage is estimated to be $800.00. I photographed the
               scene, and the photographs have been downloaded into Spillman.
               WSU Facilities Operations was advised of the damaged window. No
               suspects or leads were identified. No further action at this
               time. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under penalty of

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 040614 at approximately 1715 I was
               dispatched to a drugs call at 438 Perham Hall. I responded and
               met with RED Mitchell who informed me she believed the room to
               be occupied. There was a feint odor of marijuana in the area. I
               knocked on the door and eventually Ishiah L. Belle (121593)
               answered the door. He had no idea why I was there. I had him
               get his roommate, Udenze O. Okoli (112394). I asked if either
               of them were medicinal marijuana patients and they confirmed
               they were not. Belle said I could search their room and look.
               Okoli denied say anything. I had them both come out into the
               hall. They denied smoking in the room. I asked if there was
               anything in the room that they should not have. Belle said
               there was alcohol. We entered the room and I told them they
               could restrict, revoke, or outright deny me permission to
               search. Okoli retrieved a joint and a small amount of
               marijuana. Belle retrieved some Bombay gin which he claimed. I
               looked in 2 drawers. Both subjects disposed of their
               contraband. I informed them that they would be referred to
               Student Conduct. I cleared. Nothing follows. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               6th day of April, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               NARRATIVE: On 04/07/14 at approximately 2314 hours I was
               driving on Merman Drive heading to the Magpie Forest as part of
               my routine patrols when I saw a vehicle parked at Magpie
               Forest. It is out of the ordinary to see a vehicle at Magpie
               Forest at night. I drove up to the vehicle and exited my patrol
               car. As I was walking up to the car the driver got out of the
               car and walked towards me. The driver, later identified as
               Bryce Jackson Stewart 01/18/90. I told Stewart why I was
               stopping to check on him and asked if he had his ID with him.
               Stewart said no. Stewart leaned into his car and told his
               passenger, Casey David Zimmerman 12/29/91, and told Zimmerman
               to give his ID to him. Stewart handed me Zimmerman's ID. I
               found this odd since I never asked for Zimmerman's ID. I ran
               Zimmerman's ID and he came back with a valid return. I asked
               Stewart how he was going to drive if he did not have his
               driver's license with him. Stewart said he was just hanging
               out. I noticed several flakes of marijuana on the center
               console of the car. I asked Stewart how much marijuana was in
               the car. Stewart said he only had a few "nugs." Stewart grabbed
               two small buds of marijuana from his center console and showed
               me. I again asked if Stewart had his ID. Stewart said he did
               not. Stewart provided his information verbally. Stewart
               identified himself as being 24 years old. I ran Stewart's
               information through dispatch and they stated Stewart was
               suspended in the 3rd degree through Washington. I asked Stewart
               how long ago did he come to the Magpie Forest. Stewart said
               they got up to the Magpie Forest just a few minutes ago. I
               asked Stewart where he started driving from. Stewart said he
               started from Larry Street where he lives. I again confirmed
               that Stewart had drove by saying, so you drove from Larry to
               here. Stewart said yes. I told Stewart that his license was
               suspended. Stewart said, "are you fucking kidding me." I told
               Stewart that I was not kidding and that he was under arrest for
               driving on a suspended license. I handcuffed (D/L) Stewart and
               advised him of his right to counsel. Stewart was searched
               incident to arrest and no weapons or items of evidentiary value
               were found. About this time Ofc. Petlovany arrived on scene.

               Ofc. Petlovany told Zimmerman that he was free to go. Using
               Stewart's cell phone, I attempted to call the owner of the car.
               There was no answer and I left a message on the cell phone
               informing the owner where the car was located. I locked up the
               car and gave Stewart the key. I transported Stewart to the
               Pullman Holding Facility where he was fingerprinted and
               photographed. Stewart was issued Sector citation 4Z0410285 for
               RCW 46.20.342.1C DWLS 3rd Degree. I explained the citation to
               Stewart and provided him with his copy. Stewart was released
               from custody and I cleared. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
