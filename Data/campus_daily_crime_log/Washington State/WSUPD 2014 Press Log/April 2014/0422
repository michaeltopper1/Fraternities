               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 042214 at approximately 0947 hours, I
               was dispatched to a report of a hit and run at the Southside
               Dining Center parking lot. Upon arrival, I contacted Donald M.
               Brabb (082558) who told me the following. On 041514 at
               approximately 1400 hours, he used the 2002 Dodge Caravan that
               was parked in the parking lot of the Southside dining center.
               On 042114 at approximately 2000 hours, one of his student
               employees went to use the vehicle and noticed that the front
               passenger side quarter panel had been damaged. Brabb has no
               idea who may have hit the vehicle. I checked the caravan and
               noticed that it was parked in a hall director parking space
               along the curb near the loading dock. I noticed there was a
               large dent and paint scratches along the front passenger side
               quarter panel and fender. I estimated the damage to the vehicle
               at approximately $1800.00. Brabb told me that he had no idea
               who may have caused the damage to the vehicle. He stated that
               trucks and vans are constantly unloading food and supplies to
               the dining center and it could have not been noticed by a
               driver of one of those vehicles. I took photographs of the
               damage and cleared shortly after. No suspects or leads. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 22nd day of April, 2014, in Pullman,

               NO OTHER UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 042214 at approximately 1301
               hours, I was dispatched to a report of a burglary in Albrook
               Hydraulics Laboratory. Upon arrival, I contacted Sheri M.
               Glaesman who told me the following. On 041814 at approximately
               1630 hours, she left her office (Rm 205) and left a key labeled
               vehicle 197 on her desk. On 042114 at approximately 0800 hours
               she returned to work and noticed the key was missing from her
               desk. She went to the vehicle (197) and noticed that a black
               and yellow roller cart was missing from the vehicle. Glaesman
               valued the cart at approximately $150.00. Glaesman told me that
               over the past year, their office has had several issues with
               items coming up missing or damaged, and she told me that
               sometimes she comes to work and the heater has been turned up
               to 85 degrees in her office. I asked her if there are any
               disgruntled employees and she told me that they are the
               internal affairs office for their department and so there are a
               large number of people who could be upset with their office. I
               asked her how many keys to the doors there were, and she told
               me there is an uncountable number of keys. I explained that due
               to the problems happening in their office, I would suggest they
               rekey the door, and get card swipe access to the office for all
               employees to maintain accountability and to attempt to stop the
               problems. Glaesman told me she would look into getting a card
               swipe access point set up with WSU Cougar Cards and change the
               lock to the room. I advised her that when the lock is changed,
               she needs to make sure that Fire Services gets the new key to
               add to the knox box. Case Inactive pending further
               investigative leads. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 22nd day of April,

               station on the 2nd floor West,SW had been pulled. I arrived and
               Pullman Fire indicated that there was no inidication of any
               fire emergency. I went to the Department of Accounting Office
               on the 2nd floor to ask if their department had any exams. The
               Accounting 231 Professor, Jean Beaulieu, said that he was about
               to give an exam on the 1st floor (room 130) when the alarm
               sounded. Beaulieu has 150 students in his class. I then went to
               the School of Hospitality and Business Management on the 3rd
               floor. They were not giving any exams today. I also visited the
               school of Management Information Systems on the 4th floor and
               they were going to check with some of the instructors to see
               whether an exam was going on during the time the alarm was
               pulled. I could not determine why the fire alarm was pulled,
               but that it is possible that it had something to do with an
               unprepared student. Nothing further at this time. MFL/313 I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this ____ day of _____________, 2014, in

               042214 around 1748 hrs I was dispatched to a request for a
               welfare check on James Bradwell, who resides in room 429 of
               Gannon Hall. I contacted the reporting party, later identified
               as Erin K Ponti (060886) and was told the following. Ponti
               explained that neither her nor the mother of James Bradwell had
               been able to reach him and were concerned. According to Ponti,
               Bradwell had received some bad news and was not taking it well.
               I asked what the news was and she told me he was not going to
               be able to graduate this spring and had been upset over the
               news. When asked about being depressed Ponti explained that
               Bradwell does take medication to help with managing his
               depression, but that he had not made any direct threat to take
               his life. I told her I would try and contact Bradwell and would
               let her know what I found. We concluded our conversation a
               short time later and I attempted to contact Bradwell and left
               him a message to call me. A short time later I received a call
               from Ponti explaining that she had spoken with Bradwell and
               there was no longer a need to pursue the welfare check on him.
               Shortly after hearing this I received a phone call from
               Bradwell. He explained that he had been tired and had turned
               his phone off to sleep. When he turned his phone back on he
               realized that he had several missed calls and text messages
               from Ponti and his mother expressing their concern. While we
               spoke Bradwell did not seem depressed and I asked him if
               everything was ok. He told me he was fine and before concluding
               our call I gave him several options if he felt he couldn't deal
               with the issues he was processing. He thanked me and we
               concluded our call a short time later. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 04/22/14 at approximately 2219 hours
               I was driving southbound on Spokane Street when I came upon a
               grey Jeep Cherokee in the northbound lane of travel next to
               Dana Hall. The Jeep had it's hazard flashers on. When I pulled
               up to the car I saw no one in the driver's seat. I pulled
               behind the car and turned on my emergency light to warn traffic
               since the Jeep was blocking the northbound lane of travel. When
               I walked up to the vehicle I found nobody inside or around the
               vehicle. I also noticed flakes of marijuana on the center
               console of the Jeep. I ran the Jeep's license plate and found
               the name Antonio Apostle as the driver. Antonio is 63 years old
               and has an address listed in the city of Puyallup, WA. Knowing
               that most students at WSU drive vehicle that are registered to
               their parents, I researched the last name of Apostle in Zzusis.
               I found a student named Elena Mae Apostle 06/27/94 who had the
               same address as Antonio. I located a cell phone number for
               Elena and called her. Elena answered the phone and I asked if
               she drove a Jeep Cherokee that was currently located on Spokane
               Street. Elena said she did. I asked Elena why it was parked in
               the middle of the roadway. Elena said her Jeep had broken down
               and she called AAA. Elena stated that AAA said it would be two
               hours before they could have a tow truck to her. Elena said
               locked her Jeep and walked home to her apartment on C St. while
               waiting for AAA to arrive. I asked Elena to return to her car
               and she said she would be right over. In the mean time Ofc.
               Petolovany and I set up cones directing traffic around the
               blocking Jeep. Once Elena arrived she stated that AAA had just
               called her telling her that they were 5 minutes away. I again
               asked Elena why she thought it was a good idea to leave her car
               blocking traffic. Elena said that her Jeep had broken down
               about a week ago and AAA told her to lock the car up, leave the
               keys under the wheel of the car, and she could leave. I told
               Elena that her car was blocking traffic and she could not leave
               it. I asked Elena why she did not call the Police to notify
               them and see if something other than just leaving the Jeep

               could be done. Elena said she did not think of that. I asked
               for Elena's driver's license which she provided. I noticed
               Elena was 19 years old. I asked Elena about the flakes of
               marijuana on the center console. Elena said it was not hers. I
               asked if the car was hers and Elena said her and her sister
               share the Jeep. Elena stated her sister was over 21 years old.
               I told Elena that if she is the only person in the car and
               there is marijuana present then she could be arrested for
               possession of marijuana. I told Elena that I would not be
               arresting her for the marijuana in her car but it would be a
               good idea to vacuum up the flakes of marijuana. About this time
               Classy Towing arrived to tow Elena's Jeep. I issued Elena a
               Sector NOI for 46.61.570.1A illegal stopping that blocked
               traffic. I explained the NOI to Elena and provided her with her
               copy. Elena asked if she was free to go and I said she was.
               Once Classy Towing had the Jeep, I picked up all the cones and
               cleared. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 23rd day of April,
               2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               Foreman (073095) for following too close and for his use of

               042214 at approximately 2256 hours I was northbound at Stadium
               Way and Vogel, speaking with Ofc. Westerman. We both heard a
               southbound vehicle with studded tires. I turned around
               southbound. There was one vehicle between me and the vehicle
               with studded tires (WA/736xdg). I was in the #1 lane (closest
               to the curb) and the other 2 vehicles were in the #2 lane. The
               vehicle without the studded tires, a Subaru (WA/U545WSU), was
               so close to the car in front of it that I was concerned that
               when I activated my emergency lights that it could cause a
               collision. I waited until they separated a bit more and
               activated my emergency lights. The Subaru pulled into the CUE
               parking area and I pulled in behind the vehicle with the
               studded tires. As I approached the vehicle, I noticed the
               Subaru was turning around to exit the CUE Parking area. I told
               the driver I had stopped to wait in her car and I walked
               towards the Subaru to warn the driver about following too
               close. From approximately 15 feet away from the Subaru I could
               smell the odor of marijuana. At the car I saw it was occupied
               by two males who appeared to be under 21 yoa. I informed the
               driver, Andrew J. Foreman (073095), that he could have been
               stopped for following too close and then I asked how much
               marijuana was in the car. He said there was not any in the car
               and that he had smoked in the car a few days earlier in the
               car. I requested Ofc. Westerman respond to my location and he
               arrived shortly after. I had Foreman give me his license while
               I walked back to the original vehicle and warned her for her
               tires. The license plate in the radio history does not match
               the vehicle and will not be added to involvements. She was free
               to go. I returned to Foreman. I had him speak with me outside
               of his vehicle. He eventually admitted sometime during the
               afternoon. I had him stick his tongue out and I observed a
               milky white film on it. His pupils were dilated. Foreman said I
               could search his vehicle. I told him he did not have to give me
               permission, he could restrict where I looked, and he could
               rescind his permission. I stated he would stand by Ofc.
               Westerman in case he needed to do so. I had the passenger,

               Nicholas J. Riggio (102794), exit the vehicle, and wait with
               Ofc. Westerman as well. In the vehicle I found a number of
               loose white pills in the center console. Foreman said they were
               allergy pills. I stood with him while Ofc. Westerman checked
               the pills on his vehicle's computer. Riggio asked if he could
               go sit in the car as I had told him he was free to go. I told
               him he could get in the car and he did. Foreman then refused
               voluntary SFST's. I then realized I had not taken all of the
               pills from the console and I had not yet confirmed if they were
               contraband. I had Riggio exit the vehicle again. As I did so, I
               could smell the odor of intoxicants coming from him. He
               initially denied drinking but then admitted to drinking Admiral
               Nelson Rum. I could smell the odor of intoxicants on his
               breath. He provided a breath sample of .042. Ofc. Westerman
               confirmed the pills were not a controlled substance. I told
               both Foreman and Riggio that they would be referred to Student
               Conduct. Both had dealt with Student Conduct before. I also
               told them that neither of them could drive. Ofc. Westerman
               parked Foreman's vehicle and they were free to go. We both
               cleared. Nothing follows. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 23rd day of April,
               2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               ____NO OTHER UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 04/23/14 at
               approximately 2356 hours I was driving westbound on Stadium Way
               near Lybecker St when I noticed a Toyota 4Runner heading
               eastbound on Stadium Way. The 4Runner had only one head light
               working. When the 4Runner passed me, I turned around an
               initiated a traffic stop. The 4Runner pulled into the
               Presbyterian Church parking lot. I contacted the driver,
               Juliana Morgan Thomsen 02/13/95, identified myself, informed
               Thomsen I was recording and explained the reason for the stop.
               I instantly recognized Thomsen because I had arrested her for
               MIP about two weeks earlier. I asked Thomsen for her driver's
               license, vehicle registration, and proof of insurance. While
               Thomsen was looking for her documents, I noticed a red glass
               bong sitting on the rear driver's side seat. I asked Thomsen if
               she could hand me the bong in the backseat and she did so.
               Thomsen said it was not her bong and someone must have left it
               in her car. The bong smelled of burnt marijuana however the car
               did not prior to me smelling the bong. I asked Thomsen when the
               last time was she smoked and she said about 2 weeks ago. I did
               not notice any signs of marijuana use with Thomsen. I asked
               Thomsen to speak with me outside of the car. Once outside I
               asked Thomsen how much marijuana was in her car. Thomsen said
               there was none. I told Thomsen that the bong had a very small
               amount of marijuana in it. As long as there was no other
               marijuana in her car I would not be charging her with the small
               amount of marijuana in the bong. Thomsen seemed to like that
               option. I told Thomsen that if I did find more marijuana in the
               car she would be charged with it. I advised Thomsen of her
               Ferrier warnings and Thomsen said she still consents to the
               search having the Ferrier warnings in mind. I searched
               Thomsen's car as she stood next to Sgt. Griffin. During the
               search I found no additional marijuana or smoking devices. I
               told Thomsen that I would not be arresting her for the bong but
               rather she would be referred to student conduct. Thomsen said
               she understood. Once back at the station, the seized bong was
               logged into evidence and marked for destruction. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
