               there was a strong language barrier. The RP could not be

               but the call was dropped. Sgt. Jacobson and I responded to
               McCroskey Hall where we found both the occupants of rooms 118

               from China. The other, Mohammed K. Kaabar (122891), had a
               mother who was in Dubai. Kaabar stated he had recently changed
               his sim card and had not communicated with his mother. He
               contacted his mother while we were there. Kaabar was not having

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 04/21/14 at approximately 0041 hours
               I was sitting at a red light at B St and Stadium Way. There was
               a silver 2004 Cadillac CTS in front of me waiting for the light
               to turn green. I ran the license plate on my MDC. The vehicle
               returned to Mahmood A. Almakhamil 10/22/92. I recognized
               Almakhamil's name because I had arrested him for DUI on
               02/21/2014. I ran Almakhamil's name and his return showed a
               misdemeanor warrant for failure to appear for a hearing
               regarding his DUI. By the time dispatch had confirmed the
               warrant, Almakhamil had pulled into the Summerhill Apartments
               off Merman Drive. Almakhamil drove next to the 20 building and
               pulled into a parking stall. I parked about 5 cars away from
               Almakhamil and turned off my headlights. I walked up to
               Almakhamil's car for a social contact. As Almakhamil exited his
               car I instantly recognized the driver to be in fact Mahmood A.
               Almakhamil 10/22/92. I asked Almakhamil if he remembered me and
               he said he did. I asked him if he went to court for his DUI.
               Almakhamil said he had sent off paperwork to postpone his
               court. I told Almakhamil that the Judge had issued a warrant
               for his arrest because he did not show up for court. I told
               Almakhamil that he was under arrest for his warrant and
               handcuffed (D/L) him. I also advised Almakhamil of his right to
               counsel. I searched Almakhamil incident to arrest and found no
               weapons or illegal items. I transported Almakhamil from the
               Summerhill Apartments to the Whitman County Jail. Once at the
               Jail, I read Almakhamil a copy of the warrant. I signed a the
               arrest warrant and turned Almakhamil over to the jail staff. A
               scanned copy of the warrant was added to the files folder.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 21st day of April, 2014, in
               Pullman, Washington. _______________________________________
