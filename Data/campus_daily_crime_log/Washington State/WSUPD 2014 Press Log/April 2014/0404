               YES XXNO OTHER UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 040414 at
               approximately 0854 horus, Hannah M. Mitchell (Stevens Hall
               Director) called advising that she heard from some residents in
               Stevens Hall that Cory R. Guffin was going into some of the
               resident's rooms in Stevens Hall over the March 29th and 30th
               weekend and they felt awkward about his entry in their rooms.
               Mitchell told me that Guffin has since left Pullman, and his
               girlfriend was talking about him being trespassed from WSU
               Campus to some of the residents of the hall. I asked Mitchell
               if all the residents knew who Guffin was and she thought they
               didn't really know him. I asked Mitchell if she would be
               willing to arrange a meeting with all the residents who had
               Guffin enter their room during my work schedule next week to
               figure out what happened and make sure he was the subject that
               was here this weekend. Mitchell told me she would make the
               arrangement for next week sometime, and have each of the
               residents in question write me a statement about their
               particular experiences with him. I checked Spillman for Guffin
               and determined that he was trespassed from WSU on 030414 at
               approximately 0008 hours in McEachern Hall room N515 by Ofc.
               Erik Welter. I advised Mitchell that he was in fact trespassed
               from WSU Campus. I thanked her and ended the call. I did a
               spillman search for people of similar physical characteristics
               of Guffin and created a photo montage from their DOL photos for
               the meeting next week. Case pending further investigation to
               contact the residents of Stevens Hall I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               NARRATIVE: On 04/04/14 at approximately 1530 hours I was
               dispatched to a theft that occurred 30 minutes prior at the
               Stephenson Market. I responded and met with the two witnesses,
               Kymberli Conger & Mytintie Gebregiorgis. Conger explained that
               she was in the market (as a customer although she works there)
               and noticed a male subject, later identified by Cougar Card as
               Alexander Hill, in the "chip aisle". Conger said she noticed
               Hill was bent down and it appeared he was putting items in his
               backpack. Conger walked to the front of the store and watched
               Hill in the two mirrors at the back of the store and it
               appeared he was putting items into his pockets as well. Conger
               said Hill began to walk to the entrance of the store and
               Gebregiorgis (who was working the front desk) confronted Hill
               and told him he had to pay for the items. Hill removed a Caesar
               Salad, a bottle of milk, 2 Franz Muffins, and 2 Protein bars.
               Hill gave Gebregiorgis his cougar card, which did not have any
               funds on it. Hill left the items on the counter and left the
               store. Brian Keithley (Dining Services Manager) was on scene
               and I told him I would contact Hill and follow up with him. I
               responded to Stephenson East Room 605. I activated my VieVu
               camera. I knocked on the door and it was answered by a male
               subject, identified as Alexander Hill. I told Hill that I was
               recording and asked if he wanted to go some where to talk. Hill
               indicated he was fine talking in the hallway. I asked Hill if
               he knew why I was there. Hill said he did and that he took a
               salad, milk, muffins, and protein bars. I asked Hill what he
               took from the store that the employee didn't know about. Hill
               said he left with a box of Cheez-Its. I asked Hill if he opened
               the box and he said no. I asked Hill if he would retrieve the
               box, which he did. I asked Hill why he took the items. Hill
               said he did not have any money on his Cougar Card. I asked Hill
               if he talked with his parents about not having money. Hill said
               his Mom didn't have any money either. I asked Hill how many
               times in the past he has taken items from the market and he
               said twice. I asked Hill if it was for the same reason and he
               said it was. I provided Hill with my business card and on the
               back I put the room number at Lighty for him to inquire about

               the food bank. I explained to him that the University has
               resources for students in his situation and suggested he use
               those resources instead of stealing items. I explained to Hill
               I would be forwarding the case to student conduct. I returned
               the box of Cheez-Its to the Market and called Keithley and
               advised him of my findings. Keithley said he wanted Hill
               trespassed from the markets on Campus and to encourage him to
               use his Cougar Card at dining centers and his money would go
               further. On 04/05/14 at approximately 1200 hours I spoke with
               Hill and advised him of the trespass. Hill said he understood
               and would not steal again. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 5th day of April,
