               14 at about 0838 hours I was dispatched to the report of a cold
               hit and run collision. The RP, Wendy J.C. Hutchins, was
               requesting phone contact. I called Hutchins and she told me
               that she was reporting the incident for insurance purposes. She
               explained that sometime between 11am and 4pm on March 13th she
               was on the WSU Campus and her car was damaged. She told me that
               she had parked in many different parking lots and did not see
               the damage until she got home, so she is unsure of where the
               collision actually occurred. Hutchins told me that she could
               send a picture of the damage that was on the passenger side to
               the front of the front door. I gave her my email address to
               send the picture to me. Hutchins does not live in Pullman and
               does not have an estimate of the damage. I gave Hutchins the
               case number. As of 1200 hours I have not received an email from
               Hutchins with the picture. **ACCESS was down on 04-02-14 and I
               could not get the vehicle return.** I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 2nd day of
               April, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               NARRATIVE: On 04-02-14 at about 1304 hours I was dispatched to
               the report of a theft that occurred at about 1130 hours. The
               RP, Zach A. Lawrence, was in the WSUPD lobby for contact. I
               contacted Lawrence and he told me the following; he said that
               he was in the basement of Terrell Library and he went to the
               food mart to get a snack, leaving his belongings on the table
               where he was studying. He said that when he returned all of his
               things were gone. Lawrence told me that he had a brown leather
               messenger bag that contained his laptop, laptop charger, a
               flashdrive, a calculator and his wallet. Lawrence told me it
               was a Dell Inspiron 15.5" black laptop. He said he had the
               charger with it and it is password protected. He told me the
               flashdrive was a 4GB but could not specify a brand and that the
               calculator was a TI83. Lawrence said his wallet was brown and
               contained two credit cards, his driver's license, WSU Cougar
               Card and his WSU Vet school ID card. Lawrence told me that he
               was working on getting his credit cards cancelled. He also said
               that he would try to get the laptop serial number to me, which
               was at his home on the westside. I asked Lawrence for his WSU
               network ID which he provided; zach.lawrence. He told me that
               the only other device he uses on the WSU wireless network is
               his iPod. I gave Lawrence my business card and the case number
               and asked him to email the serial number to me. He said he
               would. I later sent an email to WSU IT security with the
               information from the laptop requesting they have it flagged in
               their system. No suspects or leads at this time. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               was contacted by Asst Chief Hansen regarding a possible sex
               offense which had occurred on campus. Hansen asked me to
               contact Daniel T Maher (042353) and told me he had the
               information related to this case. I contacted Maher a short
               time later and was told the following. Maher explained that he
               had received a voice mail message from Diane L Decourcy
               Pickford explaining that she had been sexually violated on
               campus and that she wanted us to do something about it. The
               message did not explain when this incident took place or have
               any further information other than her name. I asked Maher to
               forward the message to me, which he did and after speaking with
               him I cleared. I returned to the WSU Police Department where I
               looked up Decourcy Pickford's information and tried to call her
               for further information. I was unable to reach her and left her
               a message for her to give me a call. Around 1840 hrs, after not
               being able to reach Decourcy Pickford by phone I drove to her
               apartment, 1645 NE Merman Dr; A302, and attempted to speak with
               her. Upon reaching her residence I found a box outside of the
               door addressed to her and knocked. Nobody was home and I
               cleared a short time later. Around 2000 hrs I tried to contact
               Decourcy Pickford again by phone and was not able to reach her.
               I will attempt to reach her again on 040314 to try and obtain
               further information on her complaint. Prior to clearing this
               call I reviewed the call from Maher and after recording it
               downloaded it to this case. Investigation continues. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.
               Dated this 2nd day of April, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.
