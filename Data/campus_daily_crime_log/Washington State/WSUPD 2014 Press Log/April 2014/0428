               reported he believes someone is sleeping in room 401 of Bryan
               Hall. Room 401 is a storage area. Harris told me there were
               sleeping pads laid on the floor as if someone was using them
               for a bed, and there was a extension cord ran to the same area
               as if they were using it for a light or heater. Harris said he
               was up in the room about a week ago and items were not arranged
               as found today. Harris also said he found the room locked and
               it is normally kept locked, but he added there are numerous
               keys out for the room. As far as Harris could tell there is
               nothing missing from the room. Harris was not identified. The
               room was checked out and found as Harris described it. The area
               in question is just to the right as you enter the door. An
               extra patrol request will be put out to Swing and Graveyard

               NARRATIVE: On April 28, 2014 at about 1129 hours I was
               dispatched to a parking problem behind Waller Hall. I responded
               to the area and contacted the complainant, Cody C. Hauff
               (06/09/95). Hauff told me he parked his truck on April 27, 2014
               at about 1600 hours. When he returned this morning, April 28,
               2014 at about 0900 hours he discovered a scratch on the
               driver's side of the truck bed. He said he just purchased the
               truck and has not noticed that scratch before. His dark colored
               truck was dirty and I could see where someone had wiped the
               dirt off of the scratched area. The scratch was about 4 inches
               long. Hauff first thought maybe the vehicle parked next to him
               illegally in a motorcycle space was to blame. After further
               analysis it appeared that the vehicle was just illegally
               parked. I issued it a parking ticket. I photographed Hauff's
               vehicle and provided him a case number. It is unknown where or
               when the scratch was done to his vehicle. I estimate the damage
               at $100.00. There area no suspects, witnesses, or leads at this
               time. No further investigation. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 28th day of

               rear quarter panel. 2 ft scratch. $300 WITNESS(ES): Unknown
               NARRATIVE: On 042814 at approximately 1618 hours I was
               dispatched to a cold noninjury collision at the Commons
               Building parking lot. I arrived on scene and spoke with Anne M.
               Pinard (043056) who works for Capital Planning and Development.
               She informed me that one of their interns, Jessica E. Brewer
               (112684), had struck a parked Ford (WA/439YAI) earlier in the
               day. Brewer was returning to the area. I met with the daughter
               of the owner of the Ford, Chyna L. Wagoner (112292). She had
               parked the vehicle and spoken with Pinard after the incident.
               Wagoner showed me the damage to her vehicle on the driver's
               rear quarter panel. There was a 2 ft long scratch. Below the
               scratch was a collection of scratches about 3" by 3". I asked
               if they were new and she said yes. They were not consistent
               with the damage I later saw on the striking vehicle. Wagoner
               provided me with her insurance, identification, and
               registration. The insurance was expired. Brewer showed up and
               explained that while trying to park she adjusted the
               positioning of the vehicle and her mirror scratched the
               unoccupied Ford. She said there was no airbag deployment and
               that she was wearing her seatbelt. Brewer showed me the Toyota
               Prius she had been driving. There was a 1.5" scratch on the
               passenger side mirror. This appeared to be the only point of
               contact between the two vehicles. I completed a Sector exchange
               of information. I explained to Wagoner that WSU was self
               insured and I put Rick Fadnes's name and number in the
               exchange. Pinard was also provided a copy to complete their
               accident report form. I later emailed Fadness to notify him.
               They had no further questions. I cleared. Pictures were
               downloaded of both vehicles. Nothing follows. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               28th day of April, 2014 in Pullman, Washington.

               ____NO OTHER UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 27 April 2014 at about
               1650 hours, Karissa M. Wolfson came to WSU PD to report she was
               sexually assault. She stated she was at 1205 McGee Way when the
               assault occurred. Wolfson said on October 27, 2013 and Taylor
               Penny went to 1205 McGee Way in Pullman. Upon arriving Taylor
               Penny and Edward went into the kitchen to make drinks. Wolfson
               stated she finished the drink when Matt Simmons came over and
               poured a drink into her cup and held it up to her mouth and
               forced her to drink. She stated after this she felt her lips go
               numb and parts of the night went blank. She believes Simmons
               carried her down to his room later in the night. Wolfson
               remembers being in Simmons bed and him walking away for a short
               time. Wolfson remembers Simmons on top of her and she was
               unable to move. She remembered him trying to force his penis
               into her vagina, but he was struggling. He grabbed some
               lubricant and used it to make it easier for him to force
               himself inside of her. Once he succeeded, She felt him on top
               of her moving back and forth as he penetrated her vagina. When
               Wolfson woke up she had blood all over her inner thighs and
               pelvic area. She also had dried semen all over her abdominal
               area and a lot of pain in her pelvic area. She had bruising in
               her pelvic region for quite some time after the assault.
               Wolfson said Penny woke her up in the morning so they could go
               to class. Wolfson went home and showered before going to class,
               after class she went to the Women's Clinic at Health and
               Wellness. Were she was provided Plan B. Matthew Simmons came to
               WSUPD. I read Simmons his Miranda warnings and he signed he
               understood them and wished to waive them. Simmons stated
               Wolfson came over to his house with Taylor Penny. He stated
               they drank and got a little drunk. Simmons said Wolfson came
               onto him and wanted to go downstairs with him. He said when
               they got to his room she took here cloths off. He went to the
               restroom and when he came out Wolfson was naked she told him to
               "come fuck me." So he got in the bed with her and they had sex.
               After sex Wolfson got out of bed and asked to use his favorite
               shirt and shorts to sleep in. Wolfson said he woke up to her

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 042814 at approximately 1933 hours I
               was dispatched to the report of someone stealing a book from
               Holland Library. The person in question, Kelsey K. Flones
               (050292), was still on scene. I arrived at the front desk of
               Holland Library and met with Teresa R. Prow (110158). Prow told
               me that Flones had walked through the detector and tripped the
               alarm. Prow had Flones go back through the detectors 3 times to
               verify. According to Prow, Flones denied having any books in
               her backpack. Prow even asked if she had any books from the
               Bookie and Flones denied having any books. Prow asked to look
               in Flones' backpack as her laptop may have tripped the alarm.
               As soon as Flones opened her backpack to show Prow, Prow
               recognized a WSU book that had external WSU markings. The book
               was "Getting The Buddha Mind" by Master Sheng-yen. The value of
               the book according Prow is $125 as that would be what would be
               charged to a student not returning it. Prow retrieved the book.
               I took pictures of it and left it with Prow. Prow also pointed
               out that the bar code in the back of the book had been ripped
               out. She stated that students generally do that in an attempt
               to bypass security but that is not the actual security feature.
               Flones admitted to taking the book but said she did not remove
               the barcode. She said that she was no longer a student and did
               not think she could check books out. She said she intended on
               bringing the book back. Prow stated that Flones had been with
               other students who could have checked the book for her. Flones
               confirmed she was with WSU students. Prow stated that she would
               like to see Flones given a "ticket" for taking the book. I
               briefly explained the only option would be an arrest and she
               indicated that was what she desired. I placed Flones under
               arrest for Theft 3rd, placed her in handcuffs, and read her
               Miranda. I took her out my patrol car and placed her in the
               back seat. I then completed Sector citation number 4Z0321325
               and issued it to her. She was released. I cleared. Nothing
               follows. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 28th day of April, 2014, in Pullman,

               he heard them laughing, but he wasn't sure. I walked around the
