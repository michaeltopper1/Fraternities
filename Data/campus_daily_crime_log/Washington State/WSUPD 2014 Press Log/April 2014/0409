               reported that Corey J. Sullivan was looking at her public
               social media pictures and it scared her. I contacted Sullivan
               and he advised that Polson suffers from schizophrenia and he
               has not had contact with her since January. Sullivan told me he
               would respect her wishes and not contact her anymore. NAME/DOB:

               was dispatched to the lobby of WSUPD regarding a harassment
               report. Upon arrival, I contacted Angela C. Polson who told me
               the following. Corey J. Sullivan and her were classmates last
               semester. Polson told me that since they had class together,
               Sullivan has been sending her emails and text messages about
               random things. He would also go onto her social media sites and
               look at her pictures. Polson told me that she wanted him to
               stop contacting her and looking at her pictures which are
               shared publically on various social media sites. I explained to
               Polson that if she shares her pictures publically, she has no
               expectation of privacy. I explained that Sullivan hasn't done
               anything criminal, but that I would contact him and ask him to
               stop contacting her. She thanked me and left. I contacted
               Sullivan and he told me that he and Polson were classmates last
               semester. He stated they became friends and went out to lunch
               sometime around December or January of 2014. Sullivan told me
               that they hadn't talked since and a couple of weeks ago, he was
               curious how she was doing because she suffers from
               schizophrenia so he texted her and emailed her without a
               response. I explained to Sullivan that she didn't want contact
               with him anymore. He told me that he would respect her wishes
               and not contact her. Unfounded Case closed I certify and
