               Bagby reported the pad lock securing the 1st floor men's shower
               room in McAllister hall had been broken. Bagby said the
               custodian observed the lock broken sitting open in place on the
               door on Friday night mid-night, 4/4/14. The first floor of
               McAllister is all offices, and the shower room has been locked,
               and unused, for a number of years. The room was found to be
               dust covered and undisturbed. The only thing that appeared to
               be damaged was the pad lock itself. The shackle was broken
               where it enters the case (shackle toe). The pad lock did not
               appear to have any marks on it where it may have been struck to
               break the shackle. The hardware connecting the lock to the door
               was not bent, or damaged, either. Bagby did say that Fac Ops
               may have broke the lock to get into the room. A call has been
               made to Fac Ops to check on this possibility. More to follow. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and

               at approximately 2200 hours, he parked his car in the Stimson
               Hall parking lot. When he returned on 040814 at approximately
               1300 hours, he noticed that "FAG" was etched into the hood of
               his car and there was an approximate 5 foot key scratch
               spanning from the front driver's side fender to the rear
               driver's side door. I estimated the damage to his car at
               approximately $2000.00. Cho told me he has no idea who may have
               caused the damage to his car. I took photographs of the damage
               and asked him to contact me if he learns of any potential leads

               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W1388 SYNOPSIS: A WSU female
               student is reporting a possible domestic dispute which
               allegedly occurred on 04-05/06-14 on the WSU campus. The

               ____NO OTHER UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 04-08-14, Theresa K.
               Fitzgerald (11-30-94), called Whitcom wanting to report a
               domestic dispute which she said occurred between 2330 hours on
               04-05-14 and 0100 hours on 04-06-14. She said the dispute
               occurred between she and Bryce L. Davidson (06-01-93). She said
               she and Davidson had been in a dating relationship for
               approximately 6 months and had been having a difficult time for
               the last 2 weeks. She decided to go out with some girl friends
               on 04-05-14 and said Davidson followed her. She said she ran
               into Davidson at approximately 2330 hours near Stadium Way and
               Lake Street. She said Davidson began yelling at her saying
               things like "I saw you grinding up against other guys while you
               were out, you are a slut, and you are a whore". She said this
               continued down Stadium Way as she was walking to Goldsworthy
               Hall. Fitzgerald said she had been staying and sleeping in
               Fitzgerald's room with him during their relationship. She said
               she felt like he was going to try to enter his room and slam
               the door in her face. She said she thought this based upon his
               body language. She said they argued once they were in the Hall
               and said Fitzgerald pushed her shoulder blades on two separate
               occasions. As the door opened she said he pushed her back
               against the door jam and then grabbed the back of her head at
               her hair line. She said he then twisted her head around and
               threw her toward his bed. She said she got up, quickly gathered
               a few of her belongings, exited his room and went to her room,
               110 Goldsworthy Hall. I did not see any bruising on her body.
               Fitzgerald said she keeps approximately $400 in cash with her
               in a tampon box that she keeps taped up. She said Davidson
               knows the box is where she kept her money and wanted to get the
               box out of his room so he did not take the money. She said she
               took the box to her room, took the cash out of the box and put
               it in her freezer. She said she had given her room keys to a
               mutual friend, Tristan C. Dournaux (04-22-93) and believes
               Davidson had been in her room. She said she returned to her
               room and found the tampon box open on her bed and the money
               missing from her freezer. She believes Davidson took her money
               as he was the only person who knew she kept her money in the

               tampon box. Fitzgerald said she is not afraid for her safety
               and said she does not believe Davidson would physically hurt
               her. I advised her to call 911 immediately if things became
               heated again between she and Davidson. I gave Fitzgerald my
               business card with her Police case number on it as well as
               several statement forms. She said she would like to be able to
               take them back to her room and take her time filling the
               statement forms out. I told her that was fine. I told her she
               could either contact me when she was done filling them out and
               I could come get them or she could drop them by the WSU Police
               Department. I contacted Davidson in his room, 118 Goldsworthy
               Hall, and asked him if he would be willing to speak with me. He
               said he would so we went to the hall staff office in the main
               lobby. I asked Davidson to tell me what happened regarding he
               and Fitzgerald. Davidson said he and Fitzgerald had been in a
               dating relationship for approximately 6 months and she had been
               staying in his room for most of the semester. He said she had
               recently been diagnosed with depressing and prescribed some
               medication for the depression. He said she had taken the
               medication for a while, but stopped because she didn't like the
               way it made her feel. He alluded to the fact Fitzgerald was on
               other drugs and mentioned ecstasy. He said she went out on 04-
               05-14 with some girl friends as they had an argument earlier in
               the day about her not taking her prescribed medication. He said
               he had gone out as well with some guy friends. He said
               Fitzgerald ran into him while they were out and began yelling
               obscenities at him. He said he walked home and she kept yelling
               at him all the way home. He said he went to enter his room and
               did not want Fitzgerald to come into the room. He said when he
               opened his door she tried forcing her way in. He said he had
               his arm out blocking the doorway, but she kept pushing and
               began yelling. He said he did not want to create a scene so he
               let her in, grabbed a few of his things, and left the room for
               the night. He said he never pushed Fitzgerald. He also said he
               had nothing to do with taking her money. I asked him if he
               would be willing to write a statement for me and he said he
               would. I left several statement forms with him and told him how
               he could get them back to me when he completed them.
               Investigation continues. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 9th day of April,

               08-14, I responded to Goldsworthy Hall and met with the first
               floor Resident Advisor Theodora A. Kasper (08-13-93). Kasper
               told me she had become aware Tristan C. Dournaux (04-22-93) had
               been staying with students in Gannon and Goldsworthy Hall for
               the past two weeks. Kasper said she had called the Residential
               Educational Director for the building, Sara Al Rashoodi, and
               asked her to meet us on the 1st floor of Goldsworthy Hall. We
               walked to room 110 Goldsworthy Hall and knocked on the door. A
               white female, later identified as Theresa K. Fitzgerald (11-03-
               94) opened the door. When Fitzgerald opened the door I saw a
               white male in her room. The male was identified as Dournaux. I
               asked Dournaux if we could talk to him in the staff office in
               the main lobby. He said "Sure" and followed Al Rashoodi. Al
               Rashoodi asked him how long he had been staying in
               Gannon/Goldsworthy and he said for the past two weeks. She
               explained he was only allowed to stay up to three consecutive
               nights. He said he understood. I informed him he was trespassed
               from Gannon and Goldsworthy Hall and told him if he was found
               in either building again he was subject to arrest for Criminal
               Trespass. He said he understood. I walked him back to 110

               at approximately 2048 hours Pullman Fire was dispatched to a
               delta response for a gas leak near Abelson room 226. I
               responded and could smell a gas. I found room 235 was
               conducting lab experiments with bunsen burners. The room's fire
               door had been propped open and the room has no hoods to handle
               fumes. The lab had apparently been running all day. Fire
               responded and could not detect any traceable levels. Captain
               Reiber said he would forward on fire safety concerns. We all
               cleared. Nothing follows. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 8th day of April,
               2014, in Pullman, Washington.
