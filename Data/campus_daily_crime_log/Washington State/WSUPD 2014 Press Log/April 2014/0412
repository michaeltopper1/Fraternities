               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 04/12/14 at approximately 2247 hours
               I was driving eastbound on Colorado St near Northside Hall when
               I noticed a red Nissan Altima trying to leave the access road
               that leads to Regents Hall. There was a red Lincoln Navagator
               in front of the Altima when I passed. I saw the Altima's head
               lights were turned off and the Altima has it's left turn signal
               on. I pulled into the Streit Perham turn around to wait for the
               Altima to pass me. The Altima turned left onto Colorado St and
               came to a stop at the intersection of Colorado and Stadium Way.
               The Altima still did not have it's head lights on. The Altima
               turned left onto Stadium Way and finally turned on it head
               light. I initiated a traffic stop at Stadium Way and the St.
               John church. I contacted the driver, identified myself,
               informed the driver I was recording and explained the reason
               for the stop. I asked the driver for his driver's license and
               he said he did not have it. I asked the driver if he had a
               driver's license and he said no. I asked the driver why he was
               driving and he stated he was just running to the gas station
               real quick. I asked who's car it was and the driver said it was
               his girlfriend's car who was sitting in the passenger's seat.
               The passenger/girlfriend was later identified as, Erica
               Preshona Turner 09/10/91. The driver verbally identified
               himself as Antonio Green 05/10/90. I asked green if he has ever
               had a state issued ID card. Green said no. Green said he was
               from Ohio and has only lived in Washington for about 2 years. I
               ran Green through dispatch and dispatch stated there was no
               return. I asked Green to step out of the car and he did. I told
               Green he was under arrest for driving without a license and
               handcuffed (D/L) him. I advised Green of his right to counsel.
               Green was searched incident to arrest and no weapons or items

               of evidentiary value were found. I placed Green in the backseat
               of my patrol car. I recontacted Turner who was still sitting in
               the car. I asked Turner if she had her ID. Turner said no but
               she provided her information verbally. I asked Turner, "what is
               Antonio's last name." Tuner said "Green." I asked Turner what
               Green's date of birth was. Tuner said it was 05/10/90. I asked
               Turner if Green had ever had an ID before. Turner said no. I
               asked Turner if Green has ever been arrested before. Turner
               said, "that I know of, no." Green asked to speak to his
               girlfriend, Turner. Turner spoke to Green through the window of
               my patrol car. While Turner was talking she got a phone call
               from Green's mother. Green said his mother would confirm his
               identity. I spoke to Green's mother who identified herself as
               Qualia D. Green 02/23/73. I asked Qualia about her son's
               information. Qualia said her son is, "Anthony A. Green
               05/10/90." I asked Qualia if Green has ever had a state issued
               ID. Qualia said she did not know. Qualia provided a phone
               number so I could call her if I had any other questions. I
               later called the phone number Qualia provided and it was not a
               working number. I transported Green to Pullman Holding
               Facility. Once at the Holding Facility I asked Green why his
               mother said his first name was Anthony. Green said he goes by
               Antonio because its shorter than Anthony. I asked Green what
               was printed on his birth certificate. Green said his name is
               Antonio Anthony Green. Green was fingerprinted and
               photographed. I issued Green Sector citation 4Z0138561 for RCW
               46.20.005 no valid driver license without ID. I explained the
               citation to Green and provided him with his copy. I
               photographed Green's numerous tattoo's that were uploaded to
               Spillman under his name number. Green was released from
               custody. On 04/14/14 I went to WHITCOM to research Green's
               information. Using Linx Northwest Dispatcher Sandness was able
               to find a Seattle PD case that Green's girlfriend, Turner had
               been contacted in. When contacted by SPD Turner was also with a
               male named, Julius Antonio Sims 05/10/90. The Antonio and date
               of birth matched up to what Green had provided as his name.
               Again using Linx Northwest, Dispatcher Sandness was able to
               locate several Seattle PD cases where Julius Antonio Sims
               05/10/90 had been arrested. One of the cases had a booking
               photo of Sims. The photo of Sims was a 100% exact match for
               Green. It was determined that Green is actually Sims. There is
               no doubt in my mind that Green is in fact Julius Antonio Sims.
               Dispatcher Sandness ran Sims and located several felony
               warrants for Sims arrest. Sims is also suspended in the 3rd
               degree through Washington. I attempted to locate the Altima
               that Sims had been driving but was unsuccessful. I also
               contacted Ruchell D. Jack who lives at Chief Joseph Apartments,
               E2. Jack stated that he last saw "Antonio" last night at a
               party but was pretty sure that "Antonio" had already left town.
               I called Turner's cell phone and nobody answered. I also called
               Qualia's phone number but the number had been disconnected. I
               ran Sims criminal history. Sims has been convicted for 4
               felonies, 7 gross misdemeanors, and 1 misdemeanor. According to
               the criminal history, Sims has been arrested for a total of 26
               times in the last 9 years. Sims arrests include, robbery 2nd,

               at 434 Regents Hall. I met with the RED Ross McClure. He stated
               he believed the room to be occupied. I knocked on the door
               several times and quite loudly. Eventually, Ciara N. Becker
               (061595) answered the door. The odor of marijuana I had smelled
               in the hall increased when she opened the door. Her boyfriend,
               Avery J. Hutchison (071595), was also in the room. Both were
               under 21 and neither had a medicinal marijuana card. I had them
               step out into the hallway. The smell of marijuana lingered on
               them. They admitted to smoking marijuana off campus. They both
               had dilated pupils and a milky film on their tongues which
               indicated they had smoked marijuana. They initially denied
               having any marijuana but when I had them get their
               identification, Becker retrieved a small amount, less than 10
               grams, of marijuana. She disposed of it. I told them they would
               be both referred to Student Conduct. Hutchison was not too
               concerned as he said he would be leaving WSU at the end of the
               semester. I then informed him about his non-extraditable
               warrant. I cleared. Nothing follows. I certify and declare

               activated my police traffic radar unit (vh 7) which emitted a
               high pitched audio doppler tone that was steady in pitch. I
               observed a display on the radar unit of 33 MPH. The vehicle was
               the only moving vehicle in the radar field at the time of the
               readings. The calibration of the radar unit was checked both
               before and after the stop by the use of factory certified
               tuning forks. The radar unit was found to be in proper working
               order. I turned around an initiated a traffic stop on the
               vehicle, turning on my overhead lights. The vehicle stopped in
               the McDonalds parking lot off Stadium Way. I contacted the
               driver, Cindy K. Gleesing (041456), and told her the reason for
               the stop and the stop was being recorded. As I spoke to
               Gleesing I could smell the odor of intoxicants emitting from
               the vehicle and noticed a nearly empty bottle of wine on the
               rear floorboard. I asked Gleesing for her driver's license,
               vehicle registration, and proof of insurance. Gleesing provided
               the requested information. I asked Gleesing how much she had to
               drink earlier in the night and she admitted to having had a
               couple beers. I asked her if I could check her eyes to see how
               much she had to drink and she agreed. I attempted to administer
               a horizontal gaze nystagmus test on her in the vehicle but she
               was unable to turn far enough toward me to avoid a positional
               alcohol nystagmus. I asked Gleesing to step from the vehicle
               and she did so. I asked if she would be willing to perform some
               field sobriety tests so I could make sure she was not impaired
               and she agreed. I had her move to the sidewalk near the
               McDonalds building. The area chosen was straight and level.
               Light was provided by my flashlight and lights from the
               building. The temperature was approximately 40 degrees.
               Gleesing was wearing a jacket, jeans, and close toed dress
               shoes. I told Gleesing I would be evaluating her based on how

               well she performed on the tests as well as how well she
               followed my instructions. She said she understood. The first
               test I administered was the horizontal gaze nystagmus test. I
               told Gleesing to stand with her feet together and her arms at
               her sides. I told her to remain in this position while I
               explained the test. Gleesing said she understood. I told
               Gleesing to follow the tip of my pen with her eyes only and not
               to move her head. Gleesing said she understood. I held my pen
               approximately 12-15 inches from her face, slightly above eye
               level. I confirmed her pupils were of equal size and her eyes
               tracked equally. As I spoke with Gleesing I could smell the
               odor of intoxicants on her breath. I observed Gleesing had
               bloodshot and watery eyes, a lack of smooth pursuit, and a
               distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation. Gleesing
               moved her head side to side numerous times during the test. At
               one point she had her hands on her cheeks to hold her head
               still at was still unable to follow my pen without moving her
               head. Due to her head movement I was unable to determine if she
               did or did not have an onset of nystagmus prior to 45 degrees.
               The second test I administered was the nine step walk and turn.
               I told Gleesing to imagine a straight line down the middle of
               the sidewalk. I told her to put her left foot on that line and
               to place her right foot in front of her left, touching heel to
               toe. I told her to keep her arms at her sides and to remain in
               this position while I explained the rest of the test. I told
               her not to begin the test until instructed to do so. Gleesing
               said she understood. I told Gleesing when instructed to begin
               the test to take nine steps, touching heel to tow down the
               imaginary straight line. I told her to look at her feet the
               entire time, touch each step heel to toe, count each step out
               loud, and keep her arms at her sides. I told her once she
               reached her ninth step to leave her front foot in place and to
               take a small series of step with her back foot to turn around.
               I told her to take nine more steps back down the same imaginary
               straight line. I reminded Gleesing to look at her feet the
               entire time, touch each step heel to toe, and count each step
               out loud. I told Gleesing it was a continuous test and once she
               started not to stop until she completed the test. I
               demonstrated the test and Gleesing said she understood my
               instructions. Gleesing started by counting the starting
               position as her first step. She stepped offline to her left on
               step 3/4 and used her arms for balance. Due to her improper
               start she only took 8 steps in her first 9 steps. Gleesing
               moved both feet while turning. Gleesing stopped after turning.
               She stopped after step 2 and used her arms for balance. The
               third test I administered was the one leg stand. I told
               Gleesing to stand with her feet together and her arms at her
               sides. At about this time she told me she has bad balance and
               can't stand on one leg in the shower to shave her legs. I told
               her I would take that into account. I told Gleesing when
               instructed to begin the test to raise one foot of her choosing
               so that toe was approximately six inches off the ground. I told
               her to keep both legs straight and her arms at her sides. I
               told her to look at her toe and to count out loud by 1000's
               (1001, 1002, 1003 and so on) until instructed to stop. I told

               her if at any point her foot touched the ground to pick it
               right back up and continue where she left off. I demonstrated
               the test and Gleesing said she understood my instructions.
               Gleesing chose to stand on her right foot raising her left.
               Gleesing put her foot down on her count of 3-1000. She picked
               it back up and started counting at 1001 again. She put her foot
               down again on her count of 1011. Gleesing used her arms for
               balance throughout the test. At this time it was my opinion
               that Gleesing's ability to drive a motor vehicle was impaired
               by alcohol. I asked Gleesing if she would provide a voluntary
               breath sample on a PBT. Gleesing thought about it for quite a
               while before saying she did not wish to provide a sample. I
               advised Gleesing she was under arrest for DUI and placed her in
               handcuffs (double locked). Intern Fairbanks searched Gleesing
               incident to arrest. I transported Gleesing to the Pullman PD
               holding facility. Upon arrival at the holding facility I
               checked the datamaster instrument. I found it in proper working
               order with the RFI antenna attached, the breath tube warm to
               the touch, and the temperature display showing a temperature of
               34.00 degrees. I asked Gleesing if she would like to speak with
               an attorney and she said she would. I contacted the on call
               public defender and allowed Gleesing to speak with him until I
               saw her hang up the phone. I read Gleesing her Constitutional
               Rights at 0132 hrs and she signed stating they were read to
               her. She also signed stating she was waiving her rights. At
               0133 hrs I checked Gleesing's mouth and found no foreign
               substances. I read Gleesing her implied consent warning for
               breath at 0136 hrs and she signed stating it was read to her. I
               asked if she would submit to a breath test and she said, "Yes".
               I checked the yes box on the DUI packet and had her initial
               next to it. I asked if she was confused at all by the implied
               consent warnings and she said, "No". I asked Gleesing the
               questions from the DUI packet. She told me she is not on any
               medications and does not take/use any drugs. She admitted to
               drinking about 2.5 beers between 9pm and 11pm. Gleesing
               provided a breath sample of .034 at 0152 hrs and a second
               sample of .032 at 0155 hours. At this time I had no indication
               of any drug use by Gleesing. I asked her several more times if
               she was on any medications and she said no. With no other
               indications she consumed any impairing substances my opinion
               became that Gleesing had enough alcohol in her system for me to
               detect during the SFST's and coupled with an abnormally high
               lack of balance/coordination led me to a reasonable belief she
               was impaired by alcohol. I told Gleesing the same and as such
               would not be charging her with any crimes. I provided Gleesing
               with her copy of the vehicle/tow impound form and explained to
               her where her vehicle could be picked up. I provided Gleesing
               with a courtesy transport to her son's residence. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 13 day of April, 2014, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 041314 at approximately 0114 hours I
               was driving westbound on NE Colorado St near the Scott-Coman
               construction site. The sidewalk has been removed on the north
               side of the road. A sidewalk exists on the south side of the
               road and crosswalks are signed and placed to allow pedestrians
               to legally access the southern sidewalk. As I drove I
               encountered Khalil De Shawn Pettway (030394) walking in the
               westbound (north) lane. As he passed by I turned around and
               parked my vehicle. I then contacted Pettway. I told him I had
               to speak with him about being a pedestrian in the roadway. When
               I spoke with Pettway I could smell the odor of intoxicants on
               his breath and he had bloodshot watery eyes. I saw a lack of
               smooth pursuit in both eyes. He provided a breath sample for my
               PBT of .170. Pettway was cooperative and polite. I warned him
               about being in the poorly lit roadway and for MIP-Exhibiting. I
               told him I was only going to refer him to Student Conduct and
               instructed to go home. As I was dealing with Pettway 2 more
               males walked eastbound in the roadway and I contacted them (see
               case 14-W1459). Pettway was free to go and I met with 2 new
               people. Nothing follows. I certify and declare under penalty of

               at approximately 0117 hours I was talking with a subject from

               and Austin J. Melhart (090194), walking in the westbound
               (north) lane of NE Colorado. I was standing just to the east of

               northside of the road had been removed. Crosswalks and signage
               were present to enable pedestrians to gain access to the
               southern sidewalk. As the two approached, I observed that they
               both appeared to be under 21 and had watery eyes. I instructed
               them to wait by the fence while I finished with my subject from

               individually smell the odor of intoxicants coming from their
               breath. Each of them displayed a lack of smooth pursuit in each
               eye and they admitted to consuming alcohol. They had been
               drinking "jager-bombs". Jacobson provided a breath sample of
               .137 for my PBT. He thought he would be the most intoxicated of
               the two. Melhart provided a breath sample of .132 for my PBT.
               They were both polite and cooperative. I counseled them on
               walking in the roadway. I told them I would refer them to

               hrs I was driving southbound on Stadium Way passing North
               Fairway Rd. when I noticed a vehicle that was driving
               northbound on Stadium Way. The vehicle, WA AKU8235, caught my
               attention because it appeared to be traveling faster than the
               posted 20 MPH speed limit. I activated my police traffic radar
               unit (VH7) which emitted a high pitched audio doppler tone that
               was increasing in pitch. I observed a display on the radar unit
               of 28 MPH that was increasing. The vehicle passed my location
               and I activated the rear radar cone in the vehicle. I observed
               a peak speed of 30MPH for the vehicle before turning around to
               make a traffic stop on the vehicle. The vehicle was the only
               moving vehicle in the radar field at the time of the readings.
               I turned around and initiated a traffic stop on the vehicle,
               turning on my overhead lights. The vehicle stopped on Stadium
               Way near Beasley Colisseum. I contacted the driver, later
               identified as Marci L. Hanan (061864), and told her the reason
               for the stop and the stop was being recorded. I asked Hannan
               for her driver's license, vehicle registration, and proof of
               insurance. She provided the requested information. As I was
               speaking with Hanan I could smell the odor of intoxicants
               emitting from the vehicle. I asked Hanan how much she had to
               drink and she said about three drinks. I asked if I could check
               her eyes to see how much she had to drink and she agreed. I
               administered a horizontal gaze nystagmus test on her in the
               vehicle and observed she had a lack of smooth pursuit and a
               distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation. I asked
               Hanan to step from the vehicle and she did so. I asked if she
               would be willing to perform a series of voluntary field
               sobriety tests so I could make sure she was not impaired and
               she agreed. I told Hanan I would be evaluating her based on how
               well she followed my instructions as well as how she performed
               on the tests. Hanan said she understood. The SFST's were
               administered on the sidewalk near Beasley Coliseum and Stadium
               Way. The area chosen was straight with a slight decline. Light
               was provided by my flashlight and nearby street lights. The
               approximate temperature was 32 degrees. Hanan was wearing a
               coat, jeans, and dress shoes with tall heels. The first test I

               administered was the horizontal gaze nystagmus test. I told
               Hanan to stand with her feet together and her arms at her
               sides. I told her to follow the tip of my pen with her eyes
               only and not to move her head. Hanan said she understood. I
               confirmed Hanan's pupils were of equal size and her eyes
               tracked equally. I could smell the odor of intoxicants on
               Hanan's breath as I explained the test and noticed she spoke
               with slurred speech. I observed Hanan had bloodshot and watery
               eyes, a lack of smooth pursuit, a distinct and sustained
               nystagmus at maximum deviation, and an immediate onset of
               nystagmus in both eyes. The second test I administered was the
               nine step walk and turn. I told Hanan if she wanted to take her
               shoes off for this test and perform the test barefoot she
               could. I told Hanan to imagine a straight line down the
               sidewalk. I told her to place her left foot on that line and
               then to put her right foot in front of her left, touching heel
               to toe. I told her to keep her arms at her sides and to remain
               in this position while I explained the rest of the test and not
               to begin until instructed to do so. Hanan said she understood.
               I told Hanan when instructed to begin to take nine steps down
               the imaginary straight line. I told her to look at her feet the
               entire time, touch each step heel to toe, count each step out
               loud, and keep her arms at her sides. I told her once she
               reached her ninth step to leave her front foot in place and to
               take a small series of steps with her back foot to turn around.
               I told her to take nine more steps back down the same imaginary
               straight line. I reminded her to look at her feet the entire
               time, touch each step heel to toe, count each step out loud,
               and keep her arms at her sides. I told Hanan it was a
               continuous test and once she started no to stop until she was
               finished with the test. I demonstrated the test and Hanan said
               she understood my instructions. At this time Hanan chose to
               take her shoes off for the test. Hanan was unable to maintain
               her balance in the starting position and stepped out of the
               starting position once. She also used her arms for balance once
               while I was explaining the test. During her first nine steps
               Hanan used her arms for balance throughout. She counted the
               starting position as step one. She stepped offline to her right
               on step 4/5 and missed touching heel to toe between steps 6/7.
               She only took 8 steps in her first nine steps because of her
               improper start. Hanan moved both feet to turn around. She used
               her arms for balance throughout her second nine steps. Hanan
               stopped after turning. She missed touching heel to toe and
               stepped offline to her right on step 1/2. She stepped offline
               to her left on step 2/3, missed touching heel to toe between
               steps 3/4, stepped offline to her left on step 4/5 and missed
               touching heel to toe between steps 5/6. The third test I
               administered was the one leg stand. I told Hanan to stand with
               her feet together and her arms at her sides. I told her to
               remain in this position while I explained the rest of the test
               and not to begin until instructed to do so. She said she
               understood. I told Hanan when instructed to begin to choose one
               foot, whichever she was most comfortable with and lift that
               foot so her toe was approximately six inches off the ground. I
               told her to point her toe so the bottom of her foot was

               parallel with the ground and to keep both legs straight. I told
               her to keep her arms at her sides, to look at her toe, and
               count out loud by 1000's (1001, 1002, 1003 and so on) until
               instructed to stop. I told her if at any time her foot touched
               the ground to pick it right back up and continue where she left
               off. I demonstrated the test and Hanan said she understood my
               instructions. Hanan chose to stand on her right foot, raising
               her left. Hanan used her arms for balance throughout the test.
               She put her foot down on her count of 1017 twice. She put her
               foot down again on her count of 1022. Hanan counted to 1023 in
               30 seconds. At this time it was my opinion that Hanan's ability
               to drive was impaired by alcohol. I asked Hanan if she would
               provide a voluntary breath sample on a PBT and she refused. I
               advised Hanan she was under arrest for DUI and placed her in
               handcuffs (double locked). I had Intern Fairbanks search Hanan
               incident to arrest. I transported Hanan to the Pullman PD
               holding facility for the breath test. Upon arrival at PPD I
               checked the datamaster instrument and found it in proper
               working order, with the mouth tube warm to the touch, RFI
               antenna attached, and temperature display showing 34.00
               degrees. I asked Hanan if she wanted to speak with an attorney
               right away and she said she wasn't sure. I told her we could
               start the paperwork and if she decided she wanted to speak with
               an attorney she could do so at any time. She said that sounded
               ok. I could not find any of the regular copies of the DUI
               packet at the time so I used the Spanish version, which also
               includes all the English instructions. I read Hanan her
               Constitutional Rights from the DUI packet at 0302 hrs and she
               signed stating they were read to her. I read her the
               constitutional rights waiver statement and she asked if that
               meant she could not speak to a lawyer later because she was
               waiving her rights. I told her all it just meant if she chose
               to answer any questions she was doing so freely without threats
               or promises of any kind. I told her she could choose to
               exercise her rights at any time and not answer any questions
               and could request an attorney at any time. Hanan said she
               understood and signed the form waiving her rights. I read Hanan
               her implied consent warning for breath and at that time she
               said she thought she should speak with an attorney. I contacted
               the on call public defender and allowed her to speak with him
               until I saw she was finished and hung up the phone. I asked
               Hanan if she wanted me to read the implied consent warnings to
               her again and she said she would just look at them herself. I
               allowed her to read over the implied consent warnings and she
               signed stating they were read to her at 0319 hrs. I asked if
               she would submit to a breath test and she said yes. I checked
               the yes box on the DUI packet. When I asked her to initial next
               to it she made a comment about if she refused I would just get
               a search warrant and take her blood. I told her she had the
               right to refuse and if she did I would place her in a holding
               cell and apply for a search warrant, which the judge may or may
               not grant. I told her if the judge was granted then I would
               have a blood draw performed for evidence. She said she was
               going to do the breath test and initialed next to the yes box.
               I checked her mouth at 0319 hrs and found no foreign

               substances. I asked Hanan the questions from the DUI packet.
               She told me she thought it was bout 0200 hrs when it was really
               0324 hrs. She admitted to having 3-4 vodka drinks. She told me
               she started drinking around 7pm and stopped about "2 hours
               ago". I asked if she believed her ability to drive was affected
               by her alcohol use and she said, "No". Hanan provided a breath
               sample of .164 at 0339 hrs and a second sample of .168 at 0342
               hrs. The test was administered in accordance with the methods
               approved by the Washington State Toxicologist pursuant to the
               Washington Administrative Code. I provided Hanan with a copy of
               the following documents: drivers' hearing request form, notice
               of hearing/conditions of release, and breath test document. I
               placed Hanan in a holding cell while I completed paperwork. I
               completed criminal citation #4Z0436955 for DUI for Hanan.
               Officer Westerman went to PPD for me and issued Hanan the
               citation. He advised me he did not see a vehicle tow impound
               form there for her. He released Hanan and I met her outside PPD
               where I provided her with a copy of the vehicle tow impound
               form. I explained when and where she could pick up her vehicle.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 13 day of April, 2014, in
               Pullman, Washington. _______________________________________
