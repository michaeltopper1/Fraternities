               04/26/14 at approximately 1856 hours I was driving southbound
               on North Fairway near the SRC when I noticed two males sitting
               on the retaining wall near the Grey 1 parking lot. As I neared
               the two, they quickly stood up and started walking away from
               me. Both males appeared to be nervous for some reason. One male
               turned into the Grey 1 parking lot and the other kept walking
               southbound on North Fairway. The two briefly looked at each
               other as if each person was walking the wrong way. When I drove
               past the area of the retaining wall I could clearly smell the
               odor of burnt marijuana. I drove passed the two and looped
               around into the parking lot that they were now both walking
               through. I pulled up to the two and told them we needed to
               talk. Both males appeared to be of high school age. I asked the
               two, who were later identified as Kyle Van Axel 02/12/96 and
               Cordell John Miller 06/04/95, why they were smoking marijuana
               in public. Miller said they were only smoking cigarettes.
               Miller had a cigarette in his hand. I told both males that I
               knew they were smoking marijuana because I could smell it. I
               asked the two to be more honest and asked how much marijuana
               they had. Axel opened his hand and showed me a half used
               cigarette. Miller handed me two cigarettes filled with
               marijuana he had in his cigarette carton. Miller and Axel
               handed me their marijuana. I asked the two if they had ever
               been arrested before. Both said no. I ran Axel and Miller's
               criminal history and there were no entries. About this time
               Ofc. Petlovany arrived on scene. I told the the two that they
               were under arrest for possession of marijuana. I handcuffed
               Axel while Ofc. Petlovany handcuffed Miller. I advised both of
               their right to counsel and each were searched incident to
               arrest. No weapons or items of evidentiary value was found
               during the search. I told the two that my case would be
               forwarded to the prosecutor with charges of possession of
               marijuana requested. I explained the process to them and told
               them they might have to return for court. I released both males
               from custody and sent them on their way. Once back at the
               station, I NIC tested the marijuana cigarettes. The cigarettes

               NARRATIVE: On 04-26-14 at approximately 2004 hours I was
               traveling on NE Orchard Dr approaching the loading dock
               entrance to the SRC when I observed traffic was slowing down
               and then saw a vehicle with its front end completely crushed in
               the SRC loading dock lot. I pulled up to the vehicle and could
               see it was just involved in an accident. I exited my vehicle
               and contacted the subjects around the vehicle. I asked them if
               they were all ok and they stated yes. I asked if anyone was
               injured and they all said no. I asked Whitcom to advise Pullman
               PD of the incident. One of the subjects told me they had been
               traveling on Orchard coming from Beasley Coliseum. As they
               approached the loading dock parking lot entrance, a vehicle
               quickly pulled out from the lot and attempted to turn left in
               front of them. They hit their brakes, but still collided with
               the vehicle. I asked where the other vehicle was and saw it was
               parked on NE Juniper Way. I confirmed with the two occupants of
               the vehicle that they were both okay and did not need medical
               attention. I advised both drivers they would need their
               identification, insurance, and registrations for the Pullman
               officer when they arrived. I took photographs of the scene and
               assisted with traffic control until I was advised I could clear
               by Pullman PD. I also requested a tow respond at the request of
               the driver of the Toyota. After Myers Towing arrived I cleared.
               I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws
               of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 27th day of April, 2014, in Pullman,

               approximately 2050 hours I was on the floor of Beasley Coliseum
               for the Snoop Dogg Concert. I noticed a male subject, later
               verbally identified as Blake H. Erno 09/10/94, standing
               approximately 10 yards away from me. Erno caught my attention
               because he was holding his phone out from his body and staring
               at it. Erno was swaying severely in a circular motion. I walked
               over to Erno and told him to come talk with me in the tunnel,
               which he did. While Erno was walking he was unsteady on his
               feet. I asked for Erno's name and DOB, which he provided. I
               could smell the odor of intoxicants on his breath as he spoke
               to me. Erno's words were slurred and hard to understand and he
               had a blank stare on his face. I ejected Erno from the coliseum
               and warned him that he would be arrested for trespassing if he
               returned. Approximately 10-15 minutes later I was walking to
               the administrative offices and was stopped by a ticket sales
               person. She handed me Erno's cougar card and a ticket and told
               me the subject said that the police had torn his ticket. I
               walked out to Erno and told him he was under arrest for
               Trespassing and MIP-Exhibiting. I handcuffed (D/L) Erno and
               advised him of his right to counsel. I searched Erno incident
               to arrest, finding no weapons or items of evidence. I walked
               Erno out to Ofc. Petlovany who transported him to Pullman PD.
               Erno was later processed and released. Erno was issued a
               citation for the arrest and provided a copy. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of

               I was asked by Whitcom to respond to back up a WCSO Reserve
               Deputy who had a vehicle fail to yield on SR 270. They stated
               the Reserve was not answering his status check. I responded to
               the area and while in route, I advised the OIC what I was
               doing. I arrived on scene with Deputy Goldsby who also
               responded. The Reserve, Langerveld, stated he had tried to stop
               the vehicle for speed on SR 270 and the driver failed to yield
               and didn't stop until he parked in his garage. Langerveld
               believed the subject was intoxicated. While on scene, a female
               exited the house and asked if she could talk to her husband. I
               advised her to wait inside until we were finished and someone
               would contact her. She complied after being verbally aggressive
               towards Langerveld. I remained on scene to assist with showing
               WSP Trooper Retzer where the residence was located as the drive
               way is difficult to find. After he arrived, I was advised I

               NARRATIVE: On 04/26/14 at approximately 2227 hours I was
               driving soutbound on B St nearing the intersection of B St and
               Colorado St. While approaching the intersection, I watched a
               silver Acura sedan start from a stop and head westbound on
               Colorado. The Acura grabbed my attention because the vehicle
               had a very loud exhaust and was accelerating quickly. I pulled
               behind the vehicle and noticed the driver was swerving from the
               center line to the curb over and over again. When the driver
               reached the intersection of Colorado and Monroe St the driver
               came within about 6 inches of hitting the curb. The car
               continued to swerve side to said and the driver crossed the
               center line. It appeared as if the driver was purposefully
               weaving his car back and forth. I initiated a traffic stop at
               Opal St and Colorado St. I contacted the driver, Mason Michael
               James Cloud 07/04/95, identified myself, informed the driver I
               was recording, and asked Cloud why he was swerving while
               driving. Cloud said his car is lowered and there is a piece on
               his undercarriage that hits bumps so he was swerving to avoid
               bottoming out. I asked Cloud for his driver's license, proof of
               insurance, and vehicle registration. Cloud said he did not have
               his registration because he just bought the vehicle about a
               month ago and still had not transferred the title. I told Cloud
               that I would have to look at the days and see if he was over
               the 45 day limit. I returned to my patrol car to run Cloud.
               Cloud's return was clear. I looked at the vehicle return and
               its stated the car was listed as sold on 03/11/14. I counted
               the days and it had been 46 days since the car was sold. Intern
               Lee stated that when he was standing at the passenger's side
               window he saw a case of beer on the floorboard. I recontacted
               Cloud and told him we needed to talk about the beer on his
               floorboard. I asked Cloud to show me the beer and he picked up
               an 18 pack of Rolling Rock beer. Cloud handed me the beer
               carton which had 9 unopened beers inside. I asked Cloud to exit
               his car. Once outside of the car I told Cloud he was under
               arrest for MIP Possession and failure to transfer title within

               45 days. Cloud was searched by Intern Lee at my direction. No
               weapons or illegal items were found. Cloud asked if there was
               any way not to tow his car. Cloud said he had a friend who
               could drive it for him. Using Cloud's cell phone, we called
               Kenta Matsukawa Hansen 12/28/94. Hansen arrived on scene about
               10 minutes later and provided me with his driver's license.
               Hansen's driver's license was clear and he drove the Acura
               away. I transported Cloud to the Pullman Holding Facility where
               he was fingerprinted an photographed. I issued Cloud Sector
               citations 4Z0459707 and 4Z0459708 for RCW 46.12.650.7 Fail to
               transfer title within 45 days and RCW 66.44.270.2A MIP
               Possession. I explained the citations to Cloud and provided him
               with his copies. Cloud was then released from custody. Nothing

               04/26/14 at approximately 2255 hours I was on the floor of
               Beasley Coliseum working the Snoop Dogg concert. I noticed a
               male subject, later verbally identified as Riley R. Norris
               06/08/95, get onto the stage at the northwest corner. Norris
               was on the stage for approximately 5 seconds before he was
               tossed off the stage by Mr. Dogg's security. CMS brought Norris
               out to the tunnel area, where I directed Ofc. Olmstead to
               arrest him for Trespassing, which he did. In order for Norris
               to get to the stage he had to climb over an approximate 4 foot
               high barricade, or climb down from the general seating (which
               is a 12 foot drop). It was set up very clearly that there is
               restricted access (which Norris did not have) on and around the
               stage. Ofc. Olmstead escorted Norris outside, where I later met
               them. Ofc. Olmstead advised me he told Norris he was under
               arrest for Trespassing as well as advised him of his right to
               an attorney. While searching Norris, Ofc. Olmstead found a
               joint in a container, but also found Norris' medical marijuana
               recommendation. I completed a citation for Trespass I. I
               explained the citation to Norris and provided him a copy. I
               released Norris from custody. Norris did not appear remorseful
               and said this is a tradition and will happen again next year. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 26th day of April, 2014, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer

               approximately 0001 hours, I was on foot patrol near Rogers
               Field when I observed a male who appeared to be under the age
               of twenty one, hanging on two girls. I could clearly see the
               male had a can of unopened beer in his left back pocket. I
               contacted him and asked him how old he was and he just stared
               at me. I could smell a very strong odor of intoxicants emitting
               from him and observed his eyes were glassy, bloodshot, and were
               watery. I also observed he was swaying in a circular motion
               about six inches in each direction. The male's pants were also
               unzipped. I again asked him his age and he stated he was 19
               years old (his ID later showed him to be 18 years old). My Axon
               camera had been activated as I was speaking with him. As he
               spoke, I observed the odor of intoxicants emitting from his
               breath as the odor became stronger. I asked the male for his
               identification and he handed me his debit card. I told him it
               was not what I asked for and he said that it was his debit
               card. I advised him I asked him for his identification and he
               said oh. He then pulled out his WA Driver's License and he was
               identified as Nolan Hoiness. I asked him why he was carrying a
               can of beer in his pocket and he told me he didn't have one. I
               told him he did and he reached behind and grabbed the can and
               explained he was just holding it for a friend. I asked him if
               he was an athlete as there was a dance at Smith Gym being
               sponsored by the football team. He told me he played football
               and when I asked him for his local address, he said he lived in
               Moscow. I asked if he attends UI and he said yes. I asked him
               if he had been previously contacted for MIP and he said yes
               that he was warned. When I did a driver's check on him I asked
               Whitcom to see if he had been previously contacted and there
               was no record of a contact for alcohol. I had him open the can
               of beer and pour out the contents. I observed Nolan was very
               intoxicated. His speech was very slurred, he was swaying in a
               circular motion while standing, and had bloodshot, watery eyes.
               I asked him if he had a friend who could take him home and he
               said he was ok. I explained that due to his intoxication I
               needed a friend to walk him home. I advised him he was under
               arrest and had the right to an attorney. I also advised him I

               understood. He stated he would call his mom and as he was
               looking at his phone, some females he had been with stated they
               would walk him home. I did not identify the females but did
               observe they appeared sober. I advised him he was free to leave

               hrs I was driving westbound on Colorado St. when I noticed a
               male who was walking westbound on Colorado St. The male caught
               my attention because there was a construction zone on the north
               side of the roadway, which blocks the sidewalk. There are signs
               directing pedestrians to cross the street because the sidewalk
               is closed. The male, later identified as Zachary Z. Shuler
               (091895), had disregarded those signs and was walking down the
               westbound lane of travel on Colorado St. He was highly
               intoxicated, staggering side to side as he walked and stumbled
               into the construction fence once. I stopped and contacted
               Shuler at the entrance to the construction zone, where I could
               have him step out of the roadway easily to speak with him. I
               asked Shuler where he was going and he said to his friends. I
               asked why he was walking in the roadway and he said because the
               sidewalk was blocked by the construction zone. I told him that
               was why there were signs directing people to cross the street.
               As I spoke to Shuler I noticed he appeared to be under the age
               of 21. I could smell the odor of intoxicants on his breath and
               noticed he spoke with slurred speech. I asked how much he had
               to drink and he admitted to having had several beers. I asked
               Shuler for his ID and he said he did not have one. I could see
               the bulge from a wallet in his back pocket and told him I
               didn't know many people who didn't carry ID in their wallet. He
               said he did not have ID. Shuler provided me with his name and
               date of birth, which confirmed he was under 21. I asked if I
               could check his eyes and he agreed. I administered a horizontal
               gaze nystagmus test on Shuler and observed he had bloodshot and
               water eyes, a lack of smooth pursuit, a distinct and sustained
               nystagmus at maximum deviation, and an immediate onset of
               nystagmus. I asked if he would submit to a PBT test so I could
               see how much alcohol was in his system and he agreed. Shuler
               agreed and provided a sample of .191 on alco sensor FST #5493.
               I advised Shuler he was under arrest for MIP Exhibiting and
               placed him in handcuffs (double locked). Search incident to

               me. I confirmed through Dispatch Shuler did not have any
               previous contacts/warnings/arrests. I told Schuler I would be
               forwarding charges for MIP Exhibiting to the Whitman County
               Prosecutor. Shuler said he was not currently a student and was
               staying with a friend in Perham Hall. I had Shuler call his
               friend to come get him so he could get back in the building.
               Shuler was released. Nothing further. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of

               ____NO OTHER UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 04/27/14 at
               approximately 0122 hours, I was driving northbound on Thatuna
               Street near Wilmer Davis Hall when I saw a group of about 5
               individuals standing near the northeast entrance into Wilmer
               Davis. One male, later identified as Shawn Joseph Marion
               08/17/95, caught my attention from the rest of the group.
               Marion was very unsteady on his feet. Marion walked up to the
               front door of Wilmer Davis and clumsily leaned onto two of the
               people. Marion stood out from the group because everybody else
               was standing still and not swaying as Marion was. Marion
               appeared to be under the age of 21 years old. I stopped my
               patrol car and walked up to the group. I pointed to Marion and
               told him I needed to speak with him. Marion walked over to me
               and we walked a little bit away from the group. I told Marion
               what I had observed and asked him if he had his ID with him.
               Marion said he did not. Marion provided his information
               verbally. Marion identified himself as 18 years old. I asked
               Marion how much he had to drink tonight. Marion said he had a
               couple of drinks. I told Marion that I believed that he had
               much more to drink than just a few. I asked Marion to think
               about his answer and Marion said he had 6 shots of Vodka and 2
               shots of Tequila. I told Marion that I believed him. I asked
               Marion if this was the normal amount he drinks. Marion said it
               was a little more than normal. I asked Marion if I could check
               his eyes and he said I could. I performed an HGN test on
               Marion. During the test I observed, equal tracking, lack of
               smooth pursuit, and distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum
               deviation. During the test Marion was swaying side to side and
               I had to remind him not to move his head twice. I could clearly
               smell the odor of intoxicants coming from Marion's breath as he
               stood before me. I researched Marion's contacts and he had not
               been arrested before. I told Marion that I would be forwarding
               charges to the prosecutor for MIP Exhibiting. I explained the
               process to Marion. I asked if one of his friends would be
               willing to walk Marion home. Robert James Froembling 06/06/95
               came forwarded and said he would. As I was finishing up,
               Froembling began to argue about why I picked out Marion. After

               trying to explain it to Froembling I told him he was not going
               to be responsible for Marion because of his argumentative
               nature. At that time Jacob Edward Stocklass 05/19/95 said he
               would walk Marion home. I told Marion that he was free to go
               and Stocklass walked him home. Charges of MIP exhibiting will
               be forwarded to the prosecutor. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 28th day of

               04/27/14 at approximately 0423 hours, I was dispatched to a
               Malicious Mischief case in progress at Perham Hall. Dispatch
               stated that a male in a black coat had broke a window that was
               broken out the night before. Upon arrival I had Cpl. Daniels
               respond to the window while I contacted the RA who called. I
               was walking through the Streit Perham lobby when a male in a
               black coat started walking towards me. When I got closer to the
               male I noticed blood along the left side of his face and on his
               hands. The male appeared to be intoxicated and I asked him if
               he was ok. The male, later identified as Henry Owen Quinton
               11/02/94, was bleeding from a laceration on the left side of
               his head. I asked Quinton how he cut his head. Quinton stated
               he did not have his cougar card with him and had no way to get
               into the building. Quinton decided to try and go through the
               broken window on Perham Hall. Quinton said he took off the
               board and tape from the window so he could crawl through it.
               Quinton said he must have cut his head when going through the
               broken window. About this time Ofc. Boyd arrived on scene. I
               had medics respond to evaluate Quinton. I asked Quinton how
               much he had to drink and he said about 7 to 8 beers in the last
               few hours. Ofc. Boyd when to find out what Cpl. Daniels had
               found. Ofc. Boyd radioed for me to ask Quinton if he left
               anything in the hallway. I asked Quinton and he said he had
               left his backpack. Ofc. Boyd brought the bag to Quinton and
               Quinton said it was his. I again asked Quinton why he choose to
               go through the window. Quinton said he had no other way to get
               in. Once medics arrived they evaluated Quinton's head and
               determined that he would need stitches to close the laceration.
               Medics bandaged his head and said he did not need to go to the
               hospital via ambulance however he needed to get it looked at. I
               asked Quinton if his roommate was sober. Quinton said he was. I
               told Quinton I would be forwarding charges to the prosecutor
               for Malicious Mischief. I walked Quinton up to his room since

               he did not have his keys. I spoke to Quinton's roommate, Samuel
               Jacob Dankers 10/22/94, who said he would take Quinton to the
               hospital. I left Quinton in the care of Dankers. I went back
               downstairs and met with the reporting party, Briana Welsh.
               Welsh stated that she had a resident come to her stating that
               someone was breaking into the building through the already
               broken window. At that point Welsh called 911. I waited on
               scene until a housing troubleshooter arrived to secure the
               window. The damage to the window is estimated at $400 dollars.
               Charges of Malicious Mischief 3rd degree will be forwarded to
               the prosecutor. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 28th day of April, 2014, in
               Pullman, Washington. _______________________________________
