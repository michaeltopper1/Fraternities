               04/13/14 at approximately 1600 hours I was dispatched to a
               malicious mischief call in the area of Bailey Brayton field.
               Whitcom said the reporting party was unsure of the location,
               but could explain it over the phone. I called the reporting
               party, Ronald Johnson, and asked where he was. Johnson said he
               was at home in Moscow, but thought that he should have remained
               on scene. I asked Johnson what happened. Johnson said he
               arrived at the baseball game during the third inning and parked
               next to a truck in the Yellow 1 lot between Ferdinands Ln and
               NE N Fairway. Johnson said when he returned to his vehicle
               after the game he noticed someone wrote in the dirt on his car
               "thanks for the door ding". Johnson said when he returned home
               he noticed a "ding" on his passenger front door that he said
               most likely happened from a key. Johnson said he could not say
               for sure it was the car next to him, but assumed it was.
               Johnson described the vehicle that was parked next to him as a
               large black pick up truck, which he referred to as a "monster
               truck". I told Johnson to keep an eye out for the vehicle since
               he informed me he was a season ticket holder. I provided
               Johnson with the case number. Since I did not see the vehicle,
               it is unknown if the damage to the vehicle was caused
               maliciously or by a "door ding". Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               NARRATIVE: On 041314 at approximately 1840 hours I was assigned
               to a found bike case. The call had originally mistakenly been
               assigned to PPD and the wrong address was entered. I found an
               abandoned bike in the northern Steptoe apartments parking lot.
               It was in an unlicensed cargo trailer. I met with the RP, Shane
               Ray McFarland (021985), who told me that he had no idea who's
               bike it was. He said the bike had been put in his trail
               sometime in November, 2013. He knew nothing about it. The bike
               had been in the same spot for approximately 5 months. The bike
               was a Huffy in an unrideable state. McFarland had not done
               anything to the bike. The bike may have been placed in the
               trailer as trash. I ran the partial serial number of
               362669145621f430 as the second to last digit was unreadable.
               The bike was not reported stolen. I confirmed with Cpl. Kuhrt
               that we would not store the bike. McFarland disposed of the
               bike. I cleared. Nothing follows. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 14th day of

               NARRATIVE: On 041314 at apporoximately 1927 hours I was driving
               eastbound on Grimes Way near Wilson Rd when I observed Kyle D.
               Peterson (041295) ride a long board down the middle of Wilson
               Rd towards Grimes Way. I saw Levi R. Laney (040695) and Jake A.
               Johnson (061594) further up the hill preparing to take the same
               line as Peterson. I stopped and parked on Wilson Rd. I called
               after Peterson but he continued westbound on the Grimes Way
               sidewalk. I approached Johnson and Laney and smelled the odor
               of marijuana come down the hill towards me. They appeared to be
               under 21. I explained to them about being in the middle of the
               road versus on the side when no sidewalk is provided as was the
               case at the end of Wilson Rd. The two admitted to smoking
               marijuana off-campus. They thought that was okay since
               marijuana is legal in Washington State. I reminded them that
               they were under 21. Both of them had dilated pupils and a milky
               film on their tongues indicating they had consumed marijauna.
               Their eyes were bloodshot. Johnson refused to allow me to look
               in his backpack. I warned them for their skateboarding and use
               of marijuana. I told them they would be referred to Student
               Conduct. Cpl. Kuhrt had responded and I referred him to look
               for Peterson who Johnson had called and found out was near the
               Observatory. I responded to the Observatory where Cpl. Kuhrt
               was with Pederson. Cpl. Kuhrt had explained about skateboarding
               in the middle of the road. Pederson denied any marijuana
               involvement. His eyes were less dilated than his friends but he
               also had the milky film on his tongue. Peterson offered to let
               me look in his bag. I found a plastic bag with trace amounts of
               green vegetable material (GVM) I recognized as marijuana
               remnants. Peterson said it was not his plastic bag. He said
               Laney may have put it in his bag. I told Peterson I would refer
               him to Student Conduct. We cleared. Nothing follows. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.
               Dated this 14th day of April, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.
