               UNIVERSITY POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W1514 SYNOPSIS: Whitcom
               advised they had received an anonymous call regarding the odor
               of marijuana emitting from within Waller Hall, room 206. The
               anonymous caller also stated they believed the male in room 206
               looked like the suspect in the Puffin Glass Studio burglary
               photos on Krem 2 who was wearing Cougar pants. I responded to
               the door, smelled the odor of marijuana, and knocked on the
               door. No one answered the door. NAME/DOB: Nicholas A. Adams

               NARRATIVE: On 04-17-14, Whitcom asked me to call them. I called
               Whitcom and asked what they needed. I was told they had
               received an anonymous phone call stating there was an odor of
               marijuana emitting from within Waller Hall, room 206. The
               anonymous caller also told Whitcom they thought the male
               suspect seen on KREM 2's web site regarding the burglary from
               Puffin Glass Studio, who was wearing Cougar pants, was in room
               206. I called the "On Duty" Waller Hall staff and asked if they
               could tell me who lived in room 206. I was told Nicholas Adams
               (08-27-94) lived in the room and he did not have a roommate. I
               then logged in to ZZUSIS and obtained a photo of Adams. In my
               opinion, there is a very strong likelihood Adams is the same
               person as the burglary suspect on Krem 2's web site for the
               Puffin Glass Studio. Sgt. Griffin checked in to service at 2100
               and received another "Drugs" call. He and I were the only
               Officers on duty for WSU so I asked Whitcom to see if the City
               of Pullman Police Department had any Officers who could assist
               me with my "Drugs" call. Officers Emerson and Engle said they
               could help me with my "Drugs" call so we met in the old
               Emergency Room parking lot at the Washington Building. We
               walked to Waller Hall, room 206. Upon arrival I could smell the
               odor of marijuana emitting from within the room and could hear
               noises and what sounded like voices coming from within the
               room. I knocked on the door and the room became silent. I
               knocked on the door two more times asking Nick to answer the
               door. No one answered the door so we cleared. Nothing further.
               I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws
               of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 17th day of April, 2014, in Pullman,

               several times, but no one open the door. At this time I cannot

               if he did not come back to her house. Tinajero said she only

               NARRATIVE: On 04/18/14 at approximately 0349 hours, I was
               dispatched to a suicide attempt call at Chief Joseph
               Apartments, unit E21. Dispatch stated Veronica D. Tinajero
               04/17/94 had told her boyfriend, Mahamed A. Madani, that she
               was going to kill herself. Sgt. Griffin and I responded to
               Chief Joseph E21. When we arrived Sgt. Griffin knocked on the
               door without answer. Dispatch stated that they were on the
               phone with Tinajero but she did not want to answer the door.
               Tinajero did open the door after talking to dispatch for a
               little while. I asked Tinajero if we could come in and she said
               we could. Tinajero went to her bedroom to put on some pants
               while we waited in the hallway. When Tinajero came back out of
               the bed room we sat down in the living room to talk. After
               talking to Tinajero I determined the following had occurred.
               Tinajero and Madani have been dating for 2 years. Over the last
               two weeks, the two have been arguing a lot. Last night was
               Tinajero's birthday and she had friends and Madani over.
               Tinajero became upset that Madani did not do enough for her
               birthday party. An argument ensued and Madani left to go back
               to his dorm. Tinajero called Madani and told him he had to come
               back to her apartment. Madani said he was tired and did not
               want to go back to her place, he just wanted to go to bed.
               Tinajero told Madani, "if you don't come back, I'll kill myself
               and make you listen to me die." Madani instantly hung up the
               phone and called 911. I asked Tinajero if she wanted to hurt
               herself and Tinajero said no. I asked Tinajero why she would
               tell Madani that she was going to kill herself. Madani said she
               was upset and thought if she said that Madani would come back
               to her place. Madani also said she had no plan or method to
               hurt herself. Madani said she is not depressed and is a happy
               person other than arguing recently with Madani. Sgt. Griffin
               spoke with Madani via cell phone who confirmed the story. Sgt.
               Griffin also spoke to Tinajero's roommate, Hannah S. Shepard
               09/12/94, who said she would look out of Tinajero for the rest
               of the night. I urged Tinajero to speak with a counselor about

               what was going on with her and told her about WSU's free
               counseling services. I provided Tinajero with my business card
               and the WSU Counseling Services 24 hour hotline. I told
               Tinajero that I would be notifying counseling services of the
               incident and they would be in touch with her. It was determined
               that Tinajero was not serious about hurting herself but rather
               used the threat to get her boyfriend to do what she wanted. I
               emailed my case to WSU Counseling Services on 04/18/14. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 18th day of April, 2014, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer
