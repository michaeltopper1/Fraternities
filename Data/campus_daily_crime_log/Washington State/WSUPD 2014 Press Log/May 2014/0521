               Deparment lobby requesting assistance after having an accident
               on his bicycle. Chief Gardner contacted me and I later
               contacted Merrill who told me the following. Merrill explained
               that he had been riding his bicycle from East Main St up
               Stadium Wy when he noticed a WSU employee on a riding lawn
               mower coming towards him. Merrill told me he stopped and when
               he tried to start again he fell over, which caused him to
               scrape his left finger, left knee, and right ankle. He asked
               for a band-aid after which he told me the bike had not been
               damaged. I gave Merrill a band-aid and some medical aid before
               he left a short time later and I cleared the call. Nothing

               suspicious male in the bushes near the playground of the park
               talking to children playing on the tire swing. I walked to the
               area and contacted Sorin M. Morgan who was fairly deep into the
               bushes, near the tire swing. I asked Morgan what he was doing
               in the bushes and he told me he was looking at the leaves. I
               asked him if he was talking to children in the area. He told me
               that he spoke with a couple of girls who were asking him about
               his stick. He told me they wanted a stick too and he was trying
               to find them one. I noticed that Morgan's pants were partially
               unzipped. I asked him why he was in the park and he told me he
               was just hanging out. I asked him if he was trying to lure the
               children in the bushes and he told me he wasn't. I told Morgan
               that he should probably leave the park before he gets into
               trouble. Morgan told me he would leave and left the area. I
               remained in the park area for a while and then cleared. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 22nd day of May, 2014, in Pullman,
