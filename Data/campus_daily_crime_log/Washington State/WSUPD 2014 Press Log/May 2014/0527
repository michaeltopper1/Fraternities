               27-14 at approximately 0832 hours, I responded to the Old
               Central Stores building for a report of a burglary. I contacted
               the RP, James Stone, who stated that sometime between 05-24-14
               at approximately 1730 hours, and today at 0600 hours, someone
               forced open a window to the old Central Stores and entered the
               building. He stated they found a chair, computer monitor, and a
               cougar head flag missing. They were unable to provide any
               serial numbers for the items. There was also some writing on a
               white board they believe the suspects did. I looked at the
               window and could see it was pulled off the track on the bottom.
               I could not see any fingerprints in the dust covering the
               glass. On the desk inside the window, I could see two separate
               shoe prints. I photographed the shoe prints. I also found a
               shoe print matching one of the ones on the desk, on a chair in
               the main room area. I was told the computer monitor taken from
               one of the rooms was a Samsung, which belonged to Capital
               Planning. They also said the chair taken was identical to the
               one with the shoe print on it. I took photographs of the shoe
               print on the chair and of the writing which was on the white
               board which said, "Adventure is out there!" and had some
               balloons below it. I later searched the phrase on the internet
               and found it comes from the movie Up. I got the information on
               the items taken and spoke to them about options for security. I
               will have swing shift or graveyard shift install some trail
               cameras in an attempt to capture any photos of possible future
               break ins. No leads or suspects at this time. I certify and
