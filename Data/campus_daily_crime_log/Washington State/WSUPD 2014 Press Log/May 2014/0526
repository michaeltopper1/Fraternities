               NARRATIVE: On May 26, 2014 at about 0804 hours Whitman County
               Sheriff's were toned out to a burglary alarm at Stoneway
               Electric Supply on SR 270. Deputy Zehm, who was responding to
               the alarm requested assistance. Officer Olmstead and I
               responded to the business and arrived prior to Deputy Zehm. We
               secured the perimeter. Once the responsible arrived on scene,
               Deputy Zehm and I searched the building. We found nothing
               suspicious or out of the ordinary inside. It is unknown why the
               glass breakage alarm activated. The wind was blowing hard and
               may have been a contributing factor. Officer Olmstead and I
               provided the necessary assistance. No further investigation. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 26th day of May, 2014, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer

    Narrative: RVWD: Asst. Chief: OFC: Olmstead/339 WASHINGTON STATE
               UNIVERSITY POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W2110 SYNOPSIS: I was
               dispatched to a burglary alarm at the Student Recreation

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 05-26-2014 at about 1011 hrs I was
               dispatched to a burglary alarm at the Student Recreation Center
               (SRC), located at 1105 NE North Fairway Road. Dispatch advised
               that the alarm originated from the main entrance doors. Officer
               Jones and I arrived on scene and contacted Saeed Kazemiabnavi
               (DOB 06-18-1990) outside the building. Kazemiabnavi said he
               thought the SRC was open, so he walked to the entrance, opened
               the door, and walked in. He realized it was closed, and he
               exited the building. I checked the main entrance and determined
               that one of the door latches was not working, and the door
               would not lock. Officer Jones and I checked the interior of the
               building and determined that nothing was out of the ordinary.
               Officer Jones and I secured the door, reset the alarm, and
               cleared the scene. I later contacted SRC administration and
               advised them of the malfunctioning door. No further action at
               this time. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this __26__ day of
               ___May___, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.
