               around 0947 hrs I was dispatched to a report of a possible

               identified as Christian M Cuba Torres (010486), by phone. Upon
               reaching Cuba Torres he told me he had received a phone call
               from a company identified as greendot.com asking him to sign up
               for their company and purchase a Moneypak from Walmart. A check
               showed both companies were legitimate but that there have been
               scams associated with them. We spoke about this for some time
               before I told him if he did not want to sign up for the service
               that he did not have to but that I would note the information.
               He told me he wasn't going to sign up for the company and just
               wanted me to be aware of the call. I thanked him for his time
               and after concluding our conversation cleared the call. Noting

               15-14 at approximately 1209 hours, I was contacted by Michael
               P. Amore outside the WSU Police Dept. He wanted to report that
               his WSU Dining Services van had been damaged. I asked him if he
               knew when the damage happened and he said no. He stated he
               noticed the damage around 1000 hours today. I asked when he
               last knew it wasn't damaged and he thought around 1530 hours on
               Tuesday, May 13th. I could see there was damage to the front
               passenger side light assembly and surrounding structure. I
               could also see some white or silver paint transfer. It appeared
               the vehicle was backed into. I took photographs of the damage.
               I asked Michael if he was the only driver of the van and he
               said no. He stated he would be talking to employees to see if
               anyone knew what had caused the damage. We looked in the area
               the vehicle had been parked when he noticed the damage and I
               did not see any pieces of broken lens on the ground to show
               where the damage occurred. I provided him with a business card
               with the case number. I asked if he had any questions and he
               said no. He stated he would contact me if received any further
               information on the damage. I cleared. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
