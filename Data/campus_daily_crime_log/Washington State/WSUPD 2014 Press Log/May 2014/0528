               14 I was given some found property which had been turned in by
               somebody from Wilmer/Davis Hall. No name was put on the
               property sheet. The items were two rings and one necklace. The
               one ring has what looks like a sapphire in the middle and has a
               very small diamond on either side. Scrolled into the band is
               hearts and "2000" on the sides. The other ring is silver and
               has a padlock type charm on it which has "925" etched on it.
               The ring has "T&Co" one side and "1837" etched into the band.
               The necklace is silver with two hearts on it. One heart has
               "please return to Tiffany & Co. New York 925" etched on it and
               the other has a tan color coating on it. I searched Spillman
               property to see if the items had been reported missing and
               could not find anything matching. Items were logged into
               evidence as found property. Photos were taken of the items and
               attached to the Files screen. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 28th day of
               May, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               I was on foot patrol in the 1300 block of Colorado St. (across
               from driveway access between PEB and Bohler) and found the
               cover to the steam tunnel access unsecured. The light was on in
               the steam tunnel and I could see the chain attachment was
               hanging loose. There has been a recent problem with subjects
               going into the steam tunnel, with reports of subjects seen at
               that specific location. I have locked that access twice in the
               last month. The location of the unsecured cover is at a highly
               traveled pedestrian area. There is construction occurring near
               that location and it is unknown if workers are leaving the
               access unsecured, or if subjects are trespassing into the
               tunnel and leaving it unsecured. Case to be forwarded to Fac
               Ops and Risk Management for a resolution. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
