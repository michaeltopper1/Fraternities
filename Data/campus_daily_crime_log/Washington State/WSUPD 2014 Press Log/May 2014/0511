               about 1500 hours WSU Police were toned out to an unknown alarm
               sounding at the Bookie. CUB employees called in the audible
               alarm. Officer Olmstead and I responded. I contacted a CUB
               employee on the ground floor entrance to the Bookie. I saw a
               male inside the store. He walked to the door and told me he was
               the Text Book Manager. The male was identified as Bouchey, Joel
               I (10/05/85). He told me that the alarm company called him
               about a burglary alarm. He responded and checked the store. No
               police were called. Bouchey said we did not need to check the
               store. He went on to say that he thinks he left one of the
               ground floor entrance doors unlocked and someone must have
               pulled it open activating the alarm. The alarm was reset, doors
               were locked and we all cleared the scene. No further

               05/11/14 at approximately 1837 hours I was monitoring traffic
               on Terre View from the drive way of 2850 NE Terre View Drive. I
               saw a white Chevrolet Camaro with orange racing stripes heading
               eastbound on Terre View. The Camaro appeared to be traveling
               faster than the posted 35 MPH zone. I activated my handheld
               radar (Decatur Scout 2013) and obtained a reading of 45 MPH.
               The driver of the Camaro saw me sitting on the side of the road
               and quickly started slowing down. When the Camaro passed my
               location I initiated a traffic stop at Terre View and Old
               County Road. I contacted the driver, Di Wang 05/05/94,
               identified myself, informed Wang I was recording, and explained
               the reason for the stop. I asked for Wang's driver's license.
               Wang said he was waiting for it to arrive in the mail. Wang
               stated he had already passed his written and practical driver's
               test. Wang provided me with a piece of paper that stated he had
               passed his written test in Moscow, ID. I returned to my car and
               ran Wang's information. Dispatch stated that Wang was suspended
               in the third degree through Washington and expired through
               Idaho as of December 2013. Dispatch also advised that Wang's
               Camaro had expired in December 2013. I went back up to Wang and
               asked him if he had any forms of ID with him. Wang provided a
               University of Idaho student ID card. The photo matched up to
               Wang. Wang was also able to correctly tell me the address on
               the Idaho return. I asked Wang to exit his car and he did. I
               told Wang that he was under arrest for driving on a suspended
               license. I handcuffed (D/L) Wang and advised him of his right
               to counsel. Wang was searched incident to arrest and no weapons
               were found. With Wang's permission I moved his Camaro onto the
               dirt road of Old County Road so it was out of the way. I issued
               Wang Sector citations for DWLS 3rd, Speeding, and tabs expired
               over two months. I explained the citations to Wang and provided
               him with his copies. I released Wang from custody. Wang said he
               would have a friend help him get the car home. Nothing further.
               I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws
               of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and

               NARRATIVE: On 05/11/14 at approximately 1928 hours I was
               driving southbound on North Fairway near the SRC when I noticed
               a red Ford Mustang heading northbound on North Fairway towards
               me. The Mustang appeared to be traveling much faster than the
               posted 20 MPH zone. I activated my in car moving radar (vehicle
               7) and obtained a reading of 38 MPH. When the Mustang passed me
               I turned around and initiated a traffic stop at North Fairway
               and the SRC. I contacted the driver, Mohammad Mahdi Khatam
               01/06/95, identified myself, informed Khatam that I was
               recording, and asked him if he knew why I had stopped him.
               Khatam said yes that it looked like he was speeding but that
               was because his check engine light was on and it shows
               different speeds. I asked Khatam if he noticed the radar sign
               that displayed his speed when he drove past it. Khatam said it
               said "speeding." I told Khatam that it displayed his speed in
               numbers. Khatam said it said, "30 something." I asked for
               Khatam's driver's license, proof of insurance, and vehicle
               registration. Khatam provided his Oregon driver's license,
               Oregon vehicle title, and an expired proof of insurance. When I
               asked about his insurance, Khatam said he needed to renew his
               policy. I returned to my patrol car and ran Khatam through
               dispatch. Dispatch stated that Khatam was suspended through
               Oregon for failure to appear for a hearing. I walked back up to
               Khatam and asked him to exit his car. Khatam did and I told him
               he was under arrest for driving on a suspended license. I
               handcuffed (D/L) Khatam and advised him of his right to
               counsel. Khatam was searched incident to arrest and no weapons
               were found. With Khatam's permission, Ofc. Kirshner parked
               Khatam's car in a parking stall. Ofc. Kirshner locked the
               Mustang and turned the keys back over to Khatam. I transported
               Khatam to the Pullman Holding Facility where I fingerprinted
               and photographed Khatam. I issued Khatam Sector citations for
               DWLS 3rd degree, speeding, and no proof of insurance. I
               explained the citations to Khatam and provided him with his
               copies. I provided Khatam with a courtesy transport from PPD
               back to the SRC. Once at the SRC I again told Khatam that he
               was not allowed to drive and if he was found driving again he

               would be taken to jail. Khatam argued with me for a while about
               this but eventually walked away. I believe that Khatam will
               continue to drive regardless of his suspension. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under

               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W1973 SYNOPSIS: I responded to

               NO OTHER UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 051214 at approximately 0105
               hours, I heard PPD dispatched to a fight at Zeppoz. Ofc. Engle
               requested assistance from WSUPD and I responded. Upon arrival,
               I contacted Cody K. Dietrich who was highly intoxicated and
               bleeding from his mouth and right elbow. Dietrich told me the
               following. He is a bouncer for the ZZU Bar and Grill and
               sometime the previous week he kicked a black male out of the
               ZZU for being too intoxicated. Tonight he walked out of Zeppoz
               into the parking lot when he was approached by three black
               males. Dietrich didn't really recall what conversation took
               place, and the next thing he knew, one of the males in a grey
               shirt and red sweat pants punched him in the face twice.
               Dietrich told me the male ran toward a white sedan parked in
               the parking lot and got inside it. Dietrich chased after the
               male in the red sweats and jumped on the hood of the car. He
               stated they were yelling at each other and then friends and
               Zeppoz staff broke up the fight. Dietrich told me that he
               doesn't know the suspect's name, but he is a regular at the ZZU
               bar. I told Ofc. Engle what Dietrich told me. I checked Zeppoz
               for the black male suspect and was unable to locate him. I
               cleared shortly after. Nothing further. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               12th day of May, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.
