               05-2014 at about 0821 hrs I was dispatched to a report of a
               burglary at the Old Central Stores Building, located at 1945 SE
               Quad Services Road. I arrived on scene and contacted the
               complainant, James M. Stone (DOB 10-27-1976). Stone is an
               employee of Washington State University Capital Planning and
               Development (WSUCPD). Stone advised that the building had been
               converted into a construction office for Skanska Construction.
               Also at the scene, I contacted Jed Tsai (DOB 09-28-1983). Tsai
               is a Senior Project Engineer for Skanska Construction. Stone
               and Tsai reported that four computer monitors had been taken
               from inside the building over the weekend. They estimated that
               the theft occurred sometime between 1700 hrs on 05-02-2014 and
               0700 hrs on 05-05-2014. Two of the monitors were the property
               of Skanska Construction, and the other two monitors were the
               property of WSUCPD. Stone and Tsai advised that the building
               was secured over the weekend, and it was unknown how someone
               could have accessed the building. The exterior of the building
               was checked, and no signs of forced entry were identified. I
               noticed that the building was an older style structure with
               multiple potential entry points. Stone and Tsai said the
               building contained other valuable items and expensive equipment
               in plain view, but nothing else was missing or disturbed. I
               photographed the scene, and the photographs were downloaded
               into Spillman. The stolen computer monitors were described as:
               Item: (1) flat screen computer monitor Make: ViewSonic Model:
               unknown Serial #: unknown Description: 22-23 inch monitor,

               did not mention any disgruntled employees and have not observed
               any suspicious activity at the construction site. No physical
               evidence was identified at the scene. No suspects or leads were

               05-2014 at about 1118 hrs I was dispatched to a report of lost
               property near the Veterinary Animal Holding / Track Barn,
               located at 2205 SE Olympia Avenue. I contacted the complainant,
               Fred A. Loaiza (DOB 05-22-1957), on the telephone. Loaiza is
               the Animal Care Facilities Manager for the Washington State
               University College of Veterinary Medicine (WSUCVM). Loaiza
               reported that the daily documentation sheet from Bighorn Sheep
               Pen #1 was missing. This pen is located southeast from the
               Veterinary Animal Holding / Track Barn and near the east side
               of the Hitchcock Equine Track. Loaiza was not sure if the sheet
               blew away in the wind or was lost by a staff member. Loaiza
               estimated that the documentation sheet was lost sometime
               between 0900 hrs on 05-03-2014 and 0900 hrs on 05-04-2014.
               Loaiza explained that each sheep pen has a unlocked box on the
               outside that contains daily documentation sheets. The sheets
               are filled out each time WSUCVM personnel visit the pens. The
               feeding, watering, general condition of the animals, and staff
               member initials are recorded on the documentation sheets.
               Loaiza said the documentation sheets do not contain any
               confidential or important information about WSUCVM operations.
               Loaiza decided to report the missing documentation sheet to the
               police department because it was somewhat unusual for one of
               them to be missing. No further action at this time.
