               approximately 0802 hours, I was dispatched to Motor Pool to
               speak with Dennis Rovetto. Dennis was requesting I administer
               an employee a PBT test. I contacted the employee in the wash
               rack area. He was identified as Taylor L. Cernich. While
               speaking with him, I could detect an odor of intoxicants
               emitting from his breath as he spoke. I also observed his eyes
               were bloodshot, watery, and appeared sleepy. I asked him if had
               been drinking alcohol earlier and he said last night. I asked
               him how much he had and he stated he and friends had shared a
               1/2 gallon of alcohol. I asked when he thought he had his last
               drink and he stated around 0300 hours. I asked him if I could
               look at his eyes and he said yes. I observed both eyes had a
               lack of smooth tracking and distinct and sustained nystagmus at
               maximum deviation with onset prior to 45 degrees. I asked him
               if he would be willing to take PBT test and he said yes. I
               asked him what he thought it might say and he said around a
               .04. I administered the test with PBT 049029 which was in
               normal operating range. A reading of .098 was observed which I
               showed to him. I asked if he had driven to work this morning
               and he said no. Dennis was with us and was aware of the results
               of the PBT. He advised Taylor he was being released from his
               position. Taylor said he understood, and he left he premise. I
               cleared. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 7th day of May, 2014, in Pullman,

               NARRATIVE: On 04-21-14 I received an email from Ben Clarke of
               WSU Athletics regarding a complaint they had received regarding
               Mitchell Nelson. The email was from Andrew Crookston who
               addressed several observations and incidents he had witnessed
               regarding Nelson. The email was forwarded to me and it reads:
               Hi Mr. Clarke, I was referred to address this concern to you by
               somebody in the Athletic Department about a fan issue at
               Women's Basketball games. If this is not an issue of you
               concern, could contact me or send it to the proper place. Thank
               you. I am usually not one to write letters of complaint or
               concern to the Athletic Department about issues and the way
               that things are being done. I love sports, they are meant to be
               fun, and the Athletic Department does a great job of making
               events enjoyable attend. However, as a member of the WSU
               community and graduate student that has been active in working
               with programs such a Green Dot on campus to promote safety and
               awareness to forms of interpersonal violence and threats. The
               particular issue that I want to bring to your attention, and I
               believe has come to your attention in the past, involves a
               certain fan that is known for attending Women's Basketball
               games over the course of several years who I know as "Mitch."
               While I do not know Mitch's last name, I think he is very
               easily identifiable and known by the coaching staff, players,
               and other personnel associated with WSU's Women's basketball
               team. I believe he has season tickets and commutes to the games
               from somewhere in Spokane County. I also know that he has
               received special permission from the athletic department to
               enter the games through the tunnel rather than the concourse at
               Beasley. A few fans have brought to my attention that Mitch has
               been a problem at Beasley in the past. And, I believe it has
               come to the attention of the Athletic Department. I was not
               aware of all of this, but a series of events over the course of
               the season a series of incidents that culminated in an incident
               in which he approached me in a threatening manner when I was
               leaving the WNIT game in Missoula, MT with my six year old son
               has led me to write this letter. As I mentioned, I barely
               became acquainted with Mitch this season as he would come and

               sit by my female friend and I at women's basketball games. He
               seemed a little "off" in his personality, but I it took me
               several games to realize that he is somebody that seems to make
               others around him uncomfortable, which may include coaches and
               players, and is prone to volatility. Below, I will list several
               incidents that I observed over the course of the season that
               have drawn my concern. I am not seeking any specific solution,
               but I do feel that the Athletic Department does need to look
               further into this matter and can hopefully provide assurance
               that nobody else is put in a situation of feeling uncomfortable
               or threatened, if that is indeed what is going on. Incident 1:
               The first incident that clued me in that something is not right
               with Mitch occurred after the Cougars home victory over UW this
               season at Beasley. Obviously, it was a huge victory for the
               team and several students flooded the court after the victory.
               I know "court storming" is a spontaneous, but not desirable,
               situation that can occur with the student body gets excited
               about big wins. Several members of the Zzu Cru did run onto the
               court and towards the players after the win. So did Mitch. As
               excited as I was for the players, I also have a filter in my
               head that tells me I can't run towards a group of college aged
               women. Mitch does not have that filter. I noticed a few players
               seemed to have expressions of discomfort when seeing his
               presence on the court. I didn't interpret this as bad or
               address it at the time, because I sort of saw Mitch as being
               innocuous (even if off keel). Now I feel that there is a much
               clearer context based on the knowledge I have now to think that
               was not alright at all and a cause for concern. Incident 2: I
               arrived early for a Women's game and met with my female friend
               to attend an event Coach Daugherty was speaking at before the
               women's game at Oregon. When I met my friend on the concourse,
               she was approached by her mother and was clearly concerned
               about the somebody that was present at the game and she wanted
               to avoid. I asked her if she was alright, but didn't probe much
               further. We attended the event and Mitch came and sat next to
               me at the game at the half where he always switches sides and
               comes to our section. During the course game, he barked
               incessantly at the officials in an extremely petulant manner
               that did not even follow the course of the game. Mitch's
               behavior was highly inconsistent with the WSU's and the Pac-
               12's sportsmanship initiative that is promoted at all athletic
               contests. His constant yelling went right into my ear and I
               grew agitated as the game moved along, but did not say
               anything. I then began to piece together that he was not as
               innocuous as he seemed and might be the reason E seemed
               concerned prior to the game. Incident 3: Prior to the next
               game, I confronted my female friend about the situation from
               the previous game and whether Mitch was the one that was making
               her feel uncomfortable. I told her that he had made the
               previous game entirely unenjoyable for me the half that he came
               and sat by us and that I didn't want him to sit by us again the
               next game. She confirmed to me that it was Mitch that was
               making her feel uncomfortable, but expressed that she did not
               want to deal with it at that game because he had a history of
               volatile episodes at Beasley in the past and it was the final

               game of the season. I told her that I would respect that for
               that game, but that the coming season it would be made clear
               that he is not to sit by her or myself under any circumstances.
               As usual, he came and sat by us again in the second half and
               made the entire half unenjoyable. I was more demonstrable in my
               agitation towards him during the game and he glared at me
               angrily as my friend and I were leaving the game. Incident 4:
               As mentioned above, I attended the WNIT game in Missoula
               travelling from Pullman with my six year-old son to support the
               team. I met up with some fans there and unfortunately we
               happened to be seated right in front of Mitch. I indicated to
               some fans near me to say something if he was bothering him. He
               was his usual self during the game and I asked him very
               politely to stop yelling directly in my ear to which he
               replied, "I don't care!" When the game was over and I was
               walking out with my son and not saying anything to Mitch or
               provoking him in any way, he literally leaped over the seat I
               was in at the game, turned extremely red, and pointed directly
               at me "To shut my mouth" and that "he would 'cheer" any way he
               wanted to." Several people witnessed the event. One gentleman
               placed his hand on his shoulder in a restraining way because he
               did seem highly volatile. I left the game very uncomfortable
               and had several fans comment to me how he was irritating them
               after the game. I was shocked that somebody would respond like
               that at a college event, let alone with somebody that was not
               provoking them unreasonably and was with a small child. Again,
               I am sorry for having to take your time to address this
               concern, but I do feel this is something that needs to be
               looked into. I think that you may already have had to address
               issues related to Mitch in the past and it might be time to
               look at those. I also think that coaches and players should be
               addressed to see if they have been made to feel uncomfortable
               or have perceived any issues with him. If it's just a matter
               between my friend and I, then I want to be assured that he does
               not approach us in any way at any future games. However, my
               past experience and a series of other observations that I
               cannot spell out as concrete evidence above leads me to believe
               that this is not the case. I do see this as a safety issue and
               want some sort of precaution taken by WSU and the Beasley
               staff. My past experience has taught me that a lot of people
               can be made to feel uncomfortable by an individual, before
               somebody takes the initiative. Unfortunately, I feel that has
               to be me in this situation. If this is an isolated issue
               between E. myself, and Mitch, then I can accept that and he
               only needs to be made aware that he is not to sit by us or
               approach us in any way at future games. If it goes beyond that,
               then I do hope WSU and Crowd Management will take the proper
               steps to ensure everybody's safety. I also ask that we are
               granted as much anonymity as possible in this situation, but I
               would be glad to meet with anybody to discuss these issues in
               more detail if need be. Thank you for your time and
               consideration to this matter. Sincerely, Andrew Crookston I
               advised Clarke I would have someone follow up with Crookston
               regarding the email and document in a police report. On 05-07-
               14 at approximately 1300 hours, I met with Crookston at WSU

               Police Dept. I advised him I would be documenting the complaint
               and thanked him for sending it to Athletics. We discussed
               options he had for dealing with Nelson if he encountered him
               again. He also told me the first name of the friend he referred
               to in the email. I have seen her sitting near Nelson during
               events and know her by her nickname, but do not have her full
               name. I asked him to speak with her and see if she wanted to
               talk with me about any of the concerns she has with Nelson. He
               stated he would call her and let her know. Documentation for
               Athletics only. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 7th day of May, 2014, in

               approximately 0255 hours I was dispatched to the 4th floor of
               Streit Hall for a noise complaint. I responded and found random

               hallway. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
