               POLICE DEPARTMENT ** COLLISION REPORT ** CASE #: 14-W1884
               SYNOPSIS: Report of a vehicle which had backed into a light
               pole. DRIVER 1: Id. Ackley, James C (080757) VEHICLE 1: Wa.
               RS09286 INSURANCE: City of Pullman, Self Insured DAMAGE: $50.00
               Property: Light Pole DAMAGE: $4000.00 WITNESS(ES): NARRATIVE:
               On 050814 around 0940 hrs I was dispatched to a report of a non
               injury collision involving a Pullman Transit van (Wa.
               RS09286and a light pole. Upon my arrival I contacted the
               driver, later identified as James C Ackley (080757), who told
               me the following. Ackley explained that he had been backing up
               the Pullman Transit van when he struck a light pole, which was
               knocked to the ground. I looked at the light pole, which had
               been busted off at its base. The pole still has its wires
               connected and WSU Facilities Operations was on scene to
               disconnect the wires and remove the pole. I photographed the
               vehicle and pole before allowing Facilities Operations to
               remove the pole. At this point I returned to speak with Ackley
               and walked over to look a the damage to the vehicle. Ackley
               pointed to an area along the passenger side rear bumper which
               had a small amount of damage. I estimated the damage to the van
               to be around $50.00 and the pole to be around $4000.00. I
               provided Ackley with my business card along with the case
               number before clearing. Nothing further. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               ____ day of _____________, 2014 in Pullman, Washington.

               WSU STUDENT: ____YES ____NO OTHER UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On
               05/08/14 at approximately 1320 hours I was called at home by
               Washington State Patrol (WSP) dispatch, who requested I respond
               to SR 195 at Carothers Rd. for a collision. WSP dispatch said
               the trooper on scene requested a DRE respond to the collision.
               I responded to WSU PD to retrieve items. I was called by Sgt.
               Scott Davis (WSP) who asked that I respond to Pullman Regional
               Hospital (PRH) to evaluate the driver that was transported
               there. I responded to PRH and noticed the subject I was
               requested to evaluate (Ryan Tritten) was in exam room 1. I saw
               Deputy McMurray was just leaving the room. I saw Dr. Bergman
               attending to Tritten. When Bergman left the room I asked him if
               I would be able to speak with Tritten and he said I would. I
               asked Bergman if any medication had been administered and he
               said no. I introduced myself to Tritten and explained my role
               as a DRE. Tritten was laying on a hospital bed, and appeared to
               still be attached to a back board (although I was not for
               sure), with his head strapped into a head/neck restraint. I
               explained to Tritten that I would like to do a few evaluations
               on him to include looking at his eyes and getting vital signs.
               Tritten said I could do that. I read Tritten his Constitutional
               Rights, which he said he understood and would waive. Tritten
               asked if he was under arrest and I told him no (he asked in an
               inquisitive/concerned voice). I checked Tritten's eyes and
               noticed they tracked equally and his pupils were equal in size.
               I did not see resting nystagmus in either eye. I saw no signs
               of nystagmus during the HGN tests. I did not see a lack of
               convergence in either eye. Tritten also crossed his eyes when I
               asked if he could. Tritten said he wore contact lenses. I
               noticed Tritten's eyes were watery. I checked Tritten's pupils
               size in room light and direct light and noted the following
               results: Tritten's Left Eye: 5.0 mm room light 3.0 mm direct
               light Tritten's Right Eye: 5.0 mm room light 3.0 mm direct
               light Both measurements were within average ranges for DRE
               purposes. I did not see rebound dilation or pupillary unrest.
               Tritten's eyes had a normal reaction to light. I asked Tritten
               when the last time he used an illicit drug was and he said he
               had never used one. I noted Tritten's vitals from the monitor.
               Pulse rate 98bpm and Blood Pressure 124/82. Tritten's pulse

               rate was slightly elevated and his blood pressure was within
               average ranges for DRE purposes. While speaking with Tritten I
               did not any out of the ordinary with his speech pattern
               (slurred, unintelligible, etc.). I did not smell any odor of
               alcohol or marijuana on Tritten. Tritten appeared to be in a
               large amount of pain while I was talking with him. Tritten said
               his chest was painful and it hurt to talk, so I kept my
               questions to a minimum. I explained to Tritten that based off
               of my observations of him he did not appear to be exhibiting
               the effects of having consumed drugs and/or alcohol, nor did he
               seem impaired. Tritten was very apologetic while I spoke with
               him. I thanked Tritten for his time and I left PRH. I responded
               to the scene of the collision and spoke with Sgt. Davis. Davis
               said the other driver, Norman Druffel, was still on scene.
               Davis asked for me to contact Druffel and do a quick assessment
               on him. I met with Druffel and explained my role as a DRE. I
               asked Druffel if I could do some quick assessments and he said
               I could. I administered the HGN test and did not see any sign
               of nystagmus. Due to Druffel's age (82) and that he had an
               artificial leg I did not feel that field sobriety tests would
               be an accurate display of impairment or non-impairment. Druffel
               provided a PBT sample of .000% (FST # 62324) at 1522 hours.
               Druffel's pulse was 60 BPM at 1523 hours. Druffel answered my
               questions appropriately and he displayed no signs of having
               consumed alcohol and/or drugs. I thanked Druffel for his time.
               I told Davis of my findings on both subjects and I cleared. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 9th day of May, 2014, in Pullman,

               dented is approximately 18" by 12". $500. WITNESS(ES): Uknown
               NARRATIVE: On 050814 at approximately 1725 hours I was
               dispatched to a cold hit and run. I contacted the RP's wife,
               Dana L. Stevenson-Finkle (052571), who said she was at home
               with the vehicle, and I could come look at it. I responded to
               1900 NW Arcadia Dr. and met with Dana. Dana stated she had
               parked her vehicle 4 tiers down on the left side of Blue Lot 1
               on the WSU campus at approximately 0830 hours. Upon returning
               to her car at 1700 hours she discovered her dented rear hatch
               on her minivan. She had no suspects or leads. She stated she
               has not been the target of any malicious behavior. The dent had
               no paint transfer, though it was muddy. I provided Dana with a
               Sector exchange of information sheet as well as my business
               card. I instructed her about contacting her insurance company.
               Photos were taken of the damage. I cleared and went to look for
               any suspect vehicle in Blue Lot one. No vehicle stood out as
               being involved. I cleared. Nothing follows. I certify and

               met with her on the sidewalk. As I spoke with her I could smell

               approximmately 6 shots of tequila over a period of
               approximately 2 hours. I checked her eyes and observed a lack
               of smooth pursuit and distinct and sustained nystagmus in each
               eye. She provided a breath sample of .188. She was oriented to

               05/09/14 at approximately 0225 hours WSU Units were emergency
               dispatched to Scott Coman Hall for a malicious mischief that
               just occurred. The reporting party, Autumn Larson (Resident
               Advisor), heard the sound of glass break and saw three male
               subjects run from the location. I was turning onto NE Colorado
               St when the call was dispatched. I asked for Pullman PD to
               respond to the area of Alfred and Duncan Ln to assist, which
               they did. Upon arrival I found Larson on the phone with
               dispatch behind Scott Hall. I spoke with Larson and learned the
               following. Larson was standing at the top of the stairwell from
               Alfred Ln on the north side of Coman Hall when the incident
               occurred. Larson said she was watching two other subjects that
               were yelling when she heard a male subject ask "should I do it"
               and then heard glass break at the hall director's window of
               Scott-Coman Hall. Larson was approximately 30 yards away when
               this occurred. Larson said three male subjects, one with a red
               hoodie and shaggy hair and facial hair, and two with black long
               sleeved shirts ran from the area where the glass broke, and
               continued to run north down the stairs onto Alfred Ln. Larson
               said they turned to the right approximately 3 houses down and
               continued to run. I knew there was an alley at that location
               that connected to Duncan Ln. I updated responding units to what
               I learned and I walked to the top of the stairs on the south
               end of Duncan Ln. I remained at this location as Pullman
               officers began to arrive in the area. I stood at the top of the
               stair for approximately 1-2 minutes. I turned around to walk
               towards Creston Ln and I heard the sound of a car's engine
               turning on and revving. I found this odd because I did not hear
               a car door open and or close. I walked back to the top of the
               stairs and noticed a vehicle that was parked within 20 feet of
               the alleyway began to drive away without its lights on. It
               appeared there were two male subjects in the front of the
               vehicle, both of which were wearing dark tops. I radioed to
               Ofc. Anderson and asked him to stop the vehicle based upon the
               close time delay, the proximity to the suspects path of flight
               & crime scene, and the manner in which the vehicle was leaving.
               Ofc. Anderson and Ofc. Emerson attempted to stop the vehicle as
               it turned onto Harvey Dr. from Duncan Ln, but it continued

               until it stopped behind Perham Hall. At the time of the stop
               there was only one occupant in the vehicle and he claimed to
               have been coming from his girlfriend's house. The driver was
               subsequently arrested for DUI. I continued to check the area
               for the suspects, but could not locate them. I went back to
               Scott-Coman and contacted the hall director, Timothy Martin.
               Martin escorted me into his room and I located a large open
               ended ratcheting wrench. It appeared the wrench was thrown
               through the window. I noticed the wrench was covered in glass
               dust as small pieces of glass. I photographed the wrench were
               it laid, and collected it in an evidence bag. I provided Martin
               with my business card and case number. I checked the area on
               foot again, but did not locate any suspects. I returned to
               WSUPD with the wrench and entered it into evidence (mainly for
               the fact it could have been taken from a surrounding
               construction area). There are no suspects or leads at this
               time. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the
               laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 9th day of May, 2014, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer
