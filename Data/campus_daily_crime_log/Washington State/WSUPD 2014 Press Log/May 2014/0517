               dispatched to a burglary alarm at the Outdoor Recreation
               Center. Upon our arrival we were contacted by an individual,
               later identified as Amanda M Schenkemeyer (041087), who
               identified herself as an employee. Schenkemeyer explained that
               she believed that she may have inadvertently set off the alarm.
               After obtaining her ID I asked her if she had keys to get back
               into the building, which she did. We entered the building and
               she reset the alarm without incident. I asked Whitcom to check
               if she was on the responsible list, and was told she was not. I
               asked them to contact a responsible to confirm that she was
               allowed inside, but was told they were unable to reach anyone.
               Schenkemeyer was released a short time later and all units
               cleared. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
