    Narrative: RVWD: LT: OFC: ENW/328 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT ** COLLISION REPORT ** CASE #: 14-W2075 SYNOPSIS:
               Report of a two vehicle non injury collision in the parking lot
               of College Hall. DRIVER 1: Wa. Curewitz, Diane C. (091746)
               VEHICLE 1: Wa. AOT9547 INSURANCE: Mutual of Enumclaw POLICY #:
               AA30013602 DAMAGE: $600.00 DRIVER 2: VEHICLE 2: Wa. 21209E
               INSURANCE: Self Insured DAMAGE: $1.00 WITNESS(ES): NARRATIVE:
               On 052214 around 1013 hrs I was dispatched to a report of a two
               car non injury collision in the parking lot of College Hall.
               Upon my arrival I spoke to Diane C Curewitz (091746) who told
               me the following. Curewitz explained that she had been parked
               in the loading dock area of College Hall and when she was
               backing her vehicle (Wa. AOT9547) out she struck the lift gate
               of a WSU cargo van (Wa. 21209E), which was parked in a handicap
               parking spot. The result of of Curewitz striking the lift gate
               caused damage to the passengers side rear bumper cover along
               with puncturing her passenger side rear tire. I looked at
               Curewitz's vehicle, which she told me had been moved since the
               collision, and noticed the damage she had mentioned to the
               body. I also noticed the passenger side rear tire had been
               replaced with the spare tire and I asked where the tire was.
               She told it was in the truck and showed me the tire at which
               point I noticed where the rim had been scraped along with the
               sidewall of the tire being punctured. I photographed the damage
               to her vehicle and tire before looking at the WSU Van. Upon
               inspection of the van I saw no damage to the lift gate or the
               vehicle itself. The vehicle was unoccupied, which is also what
               Curewitz told me at the time of the collision. I photographed
               the vehicle, which was parked in a handicap parking spot with
               the lift gate folded down and approximately 12-18 inches off of
               the ground and unattended before asking her to see her drivers
               license, registration, and proof of insurance which she
               provided. As I was finishing with taking photographs of both
               vehicles an individual, later identified as Bryce R Flamand
               (050490), walked up to me. He identified himself as the
               responsible party for the van. I asked him about parking in the
               handicap spot and he told me the following. Flamand told me
               they had arrived at College Hall to drop off some items and
               when he came around to the loading dock there were several
               vehicles parked in the loading dock. He went on to explain that
               the only available spot was in the handicap spot and he was
               only going to be there a short period of time so he had parked
               there. He unloaded his items and left the lift gate in the
               position I found it in. I asked Flamand for his information as

               well, which he provided and provided him with my business card
               and case number to give to his supervisor and released him. I
               then spoke with Curewitz again and also provided her with my
               business card and case number for reference. I told her if she
               had any questions to give me a call and before clearing we
               spoke briefly about contacting risk management to have vehicle
               repaired. I asked her if she had any further questions, having
               none I cleared a short time later. Nothing further. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.
               Dated this 22nd day of May, 2014 in Pullman, Washington.

               I responded to the Holland parking garage reference a hit and
               run accident. I contacted the RP, Daniela Martinez, who stated
               she had parked her vehicle in the garage around 1230 hours
               today. When she returned to her vehicle at 1400 hours, she saw
               the damage to her vehicle. She stated she was positive the
               damage was not there when she parked her vehicle. I took
               photographs of the damage which was to the passenger side rear
               quarter panel and bumper. I looked at the damage and did not
               see any paint transfer. I provided her with a business card
               with the case number and answered any questions she had. I
               asked her if she remembered if there was a car next to hers
               when she parked and she stated she didn't remember if there was
               or not. I advised her to call if she remembers any there being
               a vehicle or if she had any further information, and she stated
               she would. I called WSU Parking Services to see if they had an
               attendant in the parking booth earlier and they stated they do
               not have any parking attendants during the summer. No suspects

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 052214 at approximately 1834 hours
               PPD and WSUPD were notified of a traffic offense entering our
               jurisdictions. The plate provided matched the vehicle
               description. The vehicle had reportedly been swerving and drift
               from lane to lane from Moscow. It had apparently crossed the
               line 8 times. Dispatch told me they had full RP info. I was
               parked on the east side of the Wilson and Stadium Way
               intersection near Vogel. I observed a white dodge (WA/AJL2845)
               approach the light at Grimes Way and Stadium. It appeared to
               drive at a higher rate of speed up to a stopped vehicle waiting
               at the light and got rather close, however, it was not a near-
               miss collision. The vehicle proceeded by me and I confirmed the
               license plate was accurate. Dispatch confirmed they had full RP
               info and I stopped the vehicle at the Tennis Courts on N
               Fairway. I contacted the driver, John R. Turner (061682), and
               informed him about the complaint called in. He said he was not
               suffering from any medical condition nor was him impaired. I
               ran his license and then asked him if he would provide a
               voluntary breath sample for my PBT. I informed him it did not
               replace the evidentiary breath test. He provided a sample of
               .000. Turner said he may have been distracted by his radio but
               did not recall driving poorly. I thanked him for his time and
               cleared. I contacted the RP, thanked him for calling in, and
               informed him of what I discovered. Nothing follows. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.
               Dated this 23rd day of May, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               NARRATIVE: On 05/22/14 at approximately 2239 hours I was
               traveling west on E Main St towards Stadium Way. The defendant
               was traveling in front of my vehicle. As the defendant turned
               onto Stadium Way, he changed lanes from the right lane into the
               left lane without signaling. I got behind the defendant and as
               he traveled north past Nevada St. I activated my emergency
               lights. The vehicle continued to travel north on NE Stadium
               Way, passing 6 possible locations to turn off the roadway on
               the right side. I activated my VieVu camera around this time.
               At the time of the traffic stop there was no other traffic on
               the roadway in the northbound lanes. I don't recall seeing any
               southbound traffic either. I activated my siren and the vehicle
               continued north bound and stopped at the red light at Grimes
               Way. I turned off my siren and the vehicle then turned right
               onto Grimes Way. The vehicle continued eastbound on Grimes and
               I activated my siren again. The vehicle finally came to a stop
               in the Bustad parking lot. As the vehicle turned into the
               parking lot I noticed the driver's side window was rolled all
               the way down. From the time I activated my emergency lights
               until the time the defendant stopped, one minute and thirty
               seconds elapsed. I exited my patrol car and walked around the
               back of my car to the defendant's passenger side of the
               vehicle. I noticed the driver (and sole occupant) had his hands
               on the steering wheel and was staring forward with a blank look
               to him. I shined my flashlight in the car and the driver looked
               at me and nodded. I walked back around to the driver's side and
               told the driver the stop was being recorded. I asked the driver
               why he didn't pull over and he said, "Lane change." I again
               asked the driver why he did not pull over and he said he was
               looking for somewhere to pull off the road. I told the driver
               the reason for the stop and asked for his license,
               registration, and proof of insurance. Ofc. Petlovany and Sgt.
               Macy arrived on scene around this time. The driver began to
               look for his documents and I noticed as he was moving his
               movements were slow and deliberate. The driver then
               unsolicitously said, "I don't have any weapons in the car." The
               driver provided me with his registration and I told him I still

               needed his license and insurance. The driver said he did not
               have a copy of his insurance with him and provided me his WADL,
               identifying him as Duane D. Withey 10/30/72. While standing at
               the car I could smell the odor of intoxicants emitting from the
               vehicle and I saw an open "tall boy" can of Keystone Light
               behind the driver's seat. I asked Withey where he was coming
               from and he said the gas station. I asked Withey where he was
               going and he said home. I asked Withey where home was and he
               said on Joe St. While Withey spoke his responses were slow and
               quite often hard to hear. I asked Withey how much he had to
               drink. Withey said he had 2-3 beers. I asked him when his last
               beer was. Withey thought for a while and I asked him if it was
               from the open beer while he was driving and he said it was. I
               asked Withey if he felt ok to drive and he said he did. I asked
               Withey if he would perform some field sobriety tests to make
               sure he was not affected by the alcohol he had consumed. Withey
               said he was almost home. I told Withey I did not ask him that.
               I told Withey I asked if he would perform field sobriety tests.
               Withey said he would, but that he was wearing flip flops. I
               told Withey he could remove them if he wanted to do so, which
               he did, and exited his vehicle. Other officers on scene turned
               off all front facing emergency lights at this time. I explained
               to Withey I would be evaluating him on how well he performed
               the tests as well as how well he followed my instructions. I
               cautioned Withey to not began any test until I told him to do
               so. I administered the field sobriety tests in the paved and
               what I noticed to be level parking lot. The weather was clear
               with an approximate temperature of 55 degrees. Withey was
               wearing shorts, a t-shirt, and a zip up hoodie during the
               tests. Lighting was provided by overhead lights as well as
               vehicle spot lights and my flashlight. Withey indicated that he
               had a broken right foot and an injured left knee along with
               screws in his hip. The first test I administered was the HGN. I
               told Withey to stand with his feet together and his arms at his
               sides. I told Withey to follow the tip of my pen with his eyes
               only with out moving his head. I held my pen approximately 12-
               15 inches in front of Withey's face and administered the test.
               I checked Withey's eyes and noticed they tracked equally and
               his pupils were equal in size. I did not see resting nystagmus
               in either eye. I saw a lack of smooth pursuit and a distinct
               and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes. I
               saw an onset of nystagmus at approximately 40 degrees in both
               eyes. I noticed Withey swayed in a circular motion during the
               test. The next test I administered was the walk and turn.
               Withey told me there was a slope to the parking lot. I told
               Withey to stand where ever he thought was appropriate, which he
               did. I did not notice any appreciable grade in the parking lot.
               I told Withey to find an imaginary straight line and put his
               left foot on the line. I told Withey to put his right foot in
               front of his left foot touching heel to toe and leave his arms
               down at his sides. I told Withey to stay in that position while
               I explained the test. I told Withey that when I tell him to
               begin, to take nine steps touching heel to toe, watching his
               feet as he walked and count each step out loud. I told Withey
               that when he gets to step nine, to leave his lead foot in place

               and using his rear foot, take small steps around until facing
               the way he came. I told Withey to take nine steps back touching
               heel to toe and counting each step out loud. I told Withey that
               once he started, do not stop. I reminded Withey to count each
               step out loud, keep his arms at his sides, and watch his feet
               as he walked. I demonstrated the test and asked Withey if he
               understood and he said, "I think." I asked Withey if he had any
               questions and he said, "I don't think so." I told Withey to
               begin at any time. Instruction Phase: Withey stood without
               touching heel to toe and with his feet out of line. First Nine
               Steps: Withey began the test and kept his arms away from his
               sides and did not touch heel to toe on any step and stepped off
               the line on every step. Withey performed the turn as directed.
               Return Nine Steps: Withey began his return steps and again did
               not touch heel to toe and stepped off line on every step,
               keeping his arms from his sides. Withey returned at a 30 degree
               angle from his original line. The next test I administered was
               the one leg stand. Withey said due to his injuries he would not
               be able to perform the test. The next test I administered was
               the Finger to Nose test. I told Withey to stand with his feet
               together and to point his index fingers at me with a closed
               fist. I told Withey to rotate his hands up and put them next to
               his sides. I told Withey to stay in that position until I tell
               him to begin. I told Withey when I tell him to begin, to tilt
               his head back slightly and close his eyes. I told Withey when I
               say "left" to raise his left hand and touch the tip of his
               finger on his left hand to the tip of his nose, and bring his
               arm back down. I told Withey when I say "right" to raise his
               right hand and touch the tip of his finger on his right hand to
               the tip of his nose, and bring his arm back down. I
               demonstrated the test and asked Withey if he understood and he
               said, "Say it again." I clarified how to touch his nose. I
               again asked Withey if he understood the test and he said, "I
               think so." I asked Withey if there was anything he wanted me to
               clarify. I again explained the test to Withey and asked Withey
               if he had any questions and he said, "No." First attempt:
               Correct Second attempt: Bridge of his nose Third attempt: Right
               nostril Fourth attempt: Bridge of his nose Fifth attempt:
               Correct Sixth attempt: Correct I asked Withey if he would
               provide a PBT sample and he said he would, but when it came
               down to providing the sample he refused. At this time, based
               upon his driving, his physical indicators (slow deliberate
               movements), and the tests, it was my opinion that Withey's
               ability to drive was impaired by alcohol. I told Withey he was
               under arrest for DUI. Withey said he would provide a PBT
               sample. I told Withey he could, but it would not change my
               decision. I handcuffed (D/L) Withey and advised him of his
               right to counsel and reminded him that he was being audio and
               video recorded. Withey requested some water from his vehicle,
               which I retrieved from a case of bottled water in his back
               seat. I opened the sealed bottle and allowed him to have a
               drink. I searched Withey incident to arrest, finding no weapons
               or items of evidence. I placed Withey in the back seat of my
               patrol car. Ofc. Petlovany remained on scene and facilitated
               the tow with Autobody Supercenter. I transported Withey to

               Pullman PD for BAC. Upon arrival I checked the Datamaster and
               found it working properly with the RFI antenna attached, the
               mouth tube warm to the touch, and a temperature display within
               acceptable ranges. I read Withey his Constitutional Rights at
               2309 hours. I asked Withey if he understood his rights and he
               said, "I think so." I asked Withey if he needed any
               clarification of the rights and he said he did not. I asked
               Withey to sign the signature block indicating the rights were
               read to him and that he understood them and he asked to speak
               with an attorney. I asked Withey if he wanted a specific
               attorney or a public defender. Withey said he wanted to talk
               with his attorney, John Hart. I called Hart several times and
               was able to get in touch with him at 2316 hours. I had Withey
               go into the interview room and gave him the phone. Withey spoke
               with Hart until 2337 hours. Withey refused to sign the
               signature blocks on the Constitutional Rights page. I checked
               Withey's mouth at 2339 hours, finding on foreign substance. I
               read Withey his Implied Consent Warnings for Breath at 2343
               hours. Withey refused to sign that they were read to him. I
               asked him if I read the warnings to him and he said that he
               believed I did. Between the time I read Withey the warnings and
               asking him if he would provide a breath sample he told me he
               was hyperventilating. I asked Withey several times if he wanted
               an ambulance and he declined. I asked Withey if he would
               provide a breath sample and he said he would. I asked Withey to
               check the appropriate box and initial next to it, which he
               refused to do. I clarified that he was going to provide a
               breath sample, which he said he would, and I checked the "yes"
               box. Withey provided a breath sample of .158 at 2358 hours and
               a sample of .155 at 0002 hours. The breath test was
               administered in accordance to the methods approved by the
               Washington State Toxicologist pursuant to the Washington
               Administrative Code. I provided Withey with a copy of the
               following documents: Driver's Hearing Request, Notice of
               Hearing and Conditions of Release, Tow/Impound Form, and the
               Breath Test Document. I explained to Withey that due to his
               prior DUI arrest last year he would be booked into Whitman
               County Jail. I transported Withey to the Whitman County Jail
               where I issued him a SECTOR citation for DUI. I explained the
               citation to him and provided him a copy. I released Withey to
