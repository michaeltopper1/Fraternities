               ____NO OTHER UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 05/04/14 at
               approximately 1602 hours I was dispatched to a drugs call at
               Northside Hall room 458. Upon arrival I could smell the odor of
               burnt marijuana coming from room 458. I knocked on the door and
               Daniel S. Nyhuis 07/27/95 answered the door. When Nyhuis opened
               the door I could see 4 other males inside the room. The
               additional 4 males were later identified as Tracy Sean Clark
               02/17/91, Emmittwally Logoitino Suakalio 11/18/94, Tanielu
               "Daniel" Ekuale 01/13/94, and Gerald Tyshun Sterling 01/14/95.
               When Nyhuis opened the door the odor of burnt marijuana
               intensified. I asked all 5 subjects to come out into the
               hallway so we could talk. All five came out into the hallway
               and sat down. Nyhuis identified himself as being the only
               person living in room 458. I told Nyhuis that if he decided to
               turn over all his marijuana and smoking devices, this case
               would be handled only through student conduct. Nyhuis thought
               this was a good deal and went to get his stuff. Nyhuis came
               back only with rolling papers. Nyhuis said that was all he had
               since he smoked everything else. I asked where the roach was
               for the joint. Nyhuis said he had flushed it down the toilet
               before my arrival. Nyhuis said that was everything he had.
               Having no legal right to enter Nyhuis' room I had to take his
               word for it. I interviewed each person individually. Clark,
               Suakalio, Ekuale, and Sterling all stated they had come over to
               Nyhuis' room after he had smoked. All four stated they had not
               smoked marijuana and were will to take a urine analysis to
               prove it. All four are WSU football players. When I interviewed
               Nyhuis, he stated that he alone had smoked in his room about 30
               minutes before I had arrived. Nyhuis said he did not have a
               medical marijuana card. I again asked if the other four had
               smoked with him. Nyhuis said no. Nyhuis admitted to smoking one
               joint in his dorm room. I told all five males that they would
               be referred to student conduct for their involvement in this
               drug case. I warned all five about possession of marijuana. I
