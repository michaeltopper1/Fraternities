               has been turned off or opened while running. He stated this has

               late last night and when he went out in the hallway the

               the past and has caused experiments to be ruined. Chulhee did
               not have dates of these incidents occurred. Jun Seyoung called

               came back at about 0200 hours and found the cover open again on
               the incubator. Seyoung said he looked around the building but
               did not find anyone. Seyoung stated no damage was done to the
               experiment or machine. I told all parties we would do walk

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 05-29-14 at approximately 1323 hours,
               I responded to Steptoe Apts for the report of a possible
               domestic. When I arrived, the RP, pointed out an apartment in
               the W Building stating the yelling had come from there. I found
               the apartment was W202. Ofc. Welter, Sgt. Jacobson arrived and
               I knocked on the door announcing our presence. The door opened
               and I saw a male standing by the door with two other females in
               the room. I had the male exit the apartment to speak with Ofc.
               Welter and I went inside to speak with the two females. One of
               the females was identified as Yi Rong. Yi is the daughter of
               the other female who I did not identify as I was told she did
               not speak English. Yi was crying and very upset. She stated she
               had vomited on the floor and pointed to a spot on the floor. I
               asked her what was going on and it took her a little bit to
               calm down enough for me to understand what she was saying. She
               told me she and the male, Li Lu, had been dating and were
               breaking up. She stated he had been leaving and she didn't want
               him to leave. She said at one point she was going to jump off
               the balcony to run after him, but then he came into the
               apartment and put his arms around her and walked her back into
               the apartment. She stated she loved him several times and did
               not want him to leave. There was no physical altercation
               between the two, just crying and yelling. I spoke to Ofc.
               Welter about what the male said, and he stated Li had given the
               same account of the incident. I was also told the two were
               breaking up due to the mom not wanting them together. I
               returned to Yi and spoke to her for several minutes explaining
               all of the resources available to her and gave her a resource
               card. I explained to her she could not prevent Li from leaving
               if he wanted to go and she stated she understood. I explained
               to her the domestic violence laws in Washington and she stated
               she understood. She again told me they had not been fighting,
               just upset and crying because he was leaving. I asked her
               several times if she wanted to speak with a counselor and she
               said no. I spoke briefly to Li and he told me Yi's father is
               sick with cancer and is a prominent figure in China where she
               is from. He stated her mother doesn't think he is good enough
               for Yi and was taking Yi back to China. Li was upset as he has

               there was anything we could do for him and he stated he was

               him a courtesy ride to the airport. We all cleared. I certify

               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W2141 SYNOPSIS: Report of the
               theft of a Trex Hybrid bicycle from the fence on North Fairway
               near the Student Recreation Center. NAME/DOB: CITE/SECTOR#:

               STUDENT: ____YES ____NO OTHER UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 052914
               around 1434 hrs I was dispatched to a report of a stolen
               bicycle from the fence just to the South of North Fairway at
               the Student Recreation Center. I contacted the reporting party,
               later identified as Giles K Dakin-White (010989) and was told
               the following. Giles explained that he had parked his Trex
               Hybrid bicycle along the fence just to the South of the Student
               Recreation Center on North Fairway around 1630 hrs on 052214.
               He had locked the bicycle to the fence, and when he returned on
               052814 around 1500 hrs he noticed the lock and bicycle were
               gone. I asked Giles for specifics about the bicycle and was
               told it was about 2 years old and stock. The bicycle had not
               been modified in any way to readily identify it as his, but he
               did add the brakes were shot and needed to be replaced. Giles
               did not have a serial number and had no suspects. I told him I
               would check and see if someone from Facilities Operations had
               removed it and dropped it off at Surplus Stores and let him
               know. A short time later I contacted Facilities Operations and
               was told the following. Facilities Operations told me they had
               not removed any bicycles from that location at which point I
               contacted Surplus Stores to see if one had been dropped off
               during the time Giles had given me. They told me they did not
               have any new bicycles which had been dropped off for them. I
               thanked them for their time and after concluding my
               conversation checked Spillman for any reports of a bicycle
               being located in the timeframe Giles had given me. I found
               nothing that matched and contacted Giles again a short time
               later. I explained what I had learned and told him I would
               email him with the case number for reference in the event he
               located the bicycle. Nothing suspects and no further leads at
               this time. I recommend this case be closed as inactive until
               further leads develop. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 29th day of May,
               2014, in Pullman, Washington.
