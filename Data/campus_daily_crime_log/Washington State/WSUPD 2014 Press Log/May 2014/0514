               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W2002 SYNOPSIS: Report of an
               individual claiming to be a WSU employee, whom is not, trying
               to obtain a price quote for products. NAME/DOB: CITE/SECTOR#:

               STUDENT: ____YES ____NO OTHER UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 051414
               around 1016 hrs I was dispatched to a reported fraud at the
               Purchasing Office. I contacted the reporting party, later
               identified as Eric M Rogers (102570), and was told the
               following. Rogers, who is the director of purchasing for WSU,
               explained that he had been contacted by TechPower Solutions Inc
               regarding a request for a price quote. Rogers spoke with a
               representative and was told an individual who identified
               himself in an email as John Cook, was requesting a price quote
               on some items. The representative became suspicious after
               hearing about a similar situation at Ohio State University
               which had been turned over to the FBI for further
               investigation. I asked Rogers if he had a copy of the email and
               if he could forward it to me. Rogers told me he would and a
               short time later I received the email, which I later attached
               to this case. Upon looking at the email I noticed the
               information for the point of contact for TechPower Solutions
               Inc as Scott Barker along with a phone number of 425-883-9112
               X3025. Prior to concluding my conversation with Rogers I
               confirmed with him that no products had been shipped and WSU
               had not been charged any money. He told me that was correct and
               I told him I would look into this and get back to him. After
               speaking with Rogers I contacted Barker and he confirmed that
               he had received information that Ohio State University had a
               similar issue and that case had been turned over to the FBI for
               further investigation. I asked him if any product had been
               shipped out on WSU's account and was told there had been
               nothing related to the email, nor had he responded to it. I
               asked if he had the original email with the header information
               and if he could forward it to me. He told me he would and a
               short time I received the email from Baker which contained the
               information Rogers had sent to me. Prior to concluding our
               conversation I asked Baker if he or his supervisors had
               contacted the local police department to report this incident.
               He told me he was unaware if that had been done but would
               forward that information along to them. A short time after
               speaking with Baker I contacted the FBI in Cincinatti to speak
               about this case. I left a message with the desk agent to give

               me a call and will await they're call. Around 1400 hrs I
               contacted the Ohio State University Police Department and spoke
               with Lt Dragonette. He told me he remembered a little bit about
               the case and referred me to Det Susan Liu, who handled the case
               for further information. After getting Liu's email address I
               asked him if he remembered whether or not their case had been
               forwarded to the FBI for further investigation. He told me he
               believed that it had been, but that Liu would have better
               information on that. I thanked him for his time and we
               concluded our call. After speaking with Dradonette I emailed
               Liu regarding her case and asked her to contact me. I will
               await a response from her before proceeding further. At 1445
               hrs I received a phone call from Det Liu. She told me the facts
               of this case were similar to the case she had investigated. She
               also told me her case had been forwarded onto the Cincinatti
               FBI office and that they had been looking into it. I asked her
               if she had heard anything back from them on what had happened
               with this case and she had not. She did add that she still had
               the agent she had been dealing with contact information which
               she was going to send to me when she returned to the office on
               Monday the 19th. I thanked her for her help and concluded our
               call a short time later. Nothing further at this time. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this ____ day of _____________, 2014, in

               momentarily but not allow admittance. I checked the perimeter
               and found nothing suspicious. I checked the Knox box and there
               were no keys inside. Dispatch located the Responsible, a David
               W. Stout, and advised him of the alarm. I advised I could not
               gain access but did not see anything suspicious. He was
