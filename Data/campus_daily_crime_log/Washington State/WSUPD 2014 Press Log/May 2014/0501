               blocking lane one of Stadium Wy. As I approached I could see
               where the rear of the Nissan, driven by Madeline M Brown
               (090494), had appeared to have been rear ended in the driver
               side rear bumper. The result of the impact damaged the rear
               bumper, drivers side rear tail light and trunk lid. I asked if
               anyone was hurt and Brown told me her neck was stiff. I told
               her Pullman Ambulance was on its way at which point she told me
               she didn't need medical attention. We discussed this and I told
               her it would be best if she was evaluated by the ambulance crew
               and she agreed. Around this point Ofc Boyd arrived and began to
               photograph the damage to the vehicles, while I spoke with all
               of the parties involved. I initially spoke with the driver of
               the four runner, later identified as Briget C Hahn (033093),
               and was told the following. Hahn explained that she had been
               driving down Spokane St towards stadium Wy and noticed Brown's
               vehicle in front of her. As she approached Stadium Wy she told
               me she didn't see her vehicle and had turned her head to say
               something to her passenger, later identified as Ashley R
               Wilhelm (072193). As she did this Wilhelm yelled at her which
               caused her to turn her head back towards the road where she saw
               Brown's vehicle stopped. She began to brake, but was unable to
               stop before colliding with the rear of Brown's vehicle. After
               speaking with Hahn I spoke with her passenger, Wilhelm, whose
               version of the events was similar to what Hahn had told me. I
               asked both Brown and Hahn for their drivers licenses,
               registrations, and proof of insurance, which they provided and

               I later ran. Pullman Ambulance arrived around this point and
               began to evaluate Brown while I spoke to Brown's passenger,
               identified as Dylan A Jamison (081794). Jamison explained that
               he and Brown had been at the stop sign on the corner of Spokane
               St and Stadium Wy getting ready to turn right when the
               collision occurred. He went on to tell me Brown had been slowly
               pulling forward in an attempt to clear the intersection since
               she couldn't see around the bushes on the east side of the
               road. As she was preparing to enter Stadium Wy her vehicle was
               struck from behind by Hahn's vehicle. I asked if they had been
               wearing their seatbelts and was told they had been. Around this
               point Boyd had completed taking pictures of the damage and
               Brown had returned from speaking with Ambulance personnel. I
               spoke with Brown about what she remembered and was told the
               following. Brown explained that her and Jamison were preparing
               to enter Stadium Wy and she was slowly pulling forward. She
               told me she didn't know what to do. We spoke about this and I
               returned to questioning her about the collision. The remainder
               of the events matched what Jamison had told me upon speaking
               with him earlier. Both parties exchanged information and I
               provided both drivers with my business card and case number for
               insurance purposes. I also instructed both parties that if they
               had any questions to give me a call and was told they would.
               Both vehicles were removed from the roadway under their own
               power and Boyd and I cleared. Upon our return to the WSU Police
               Department Boyd downloaded the photos he had taken to this case
               and I completed the necessary paperwork. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and

               DEPARTMENT ** COLLISION REPORT ** CASE #: 14-W1768 SYNOPSIS:
               Report of a two car non injury collision in the parking lot of
               Streit/Perham. Both vehicle had left the scene prior to my
               being dispatched and upon driver #2's return, vehicle #1 was
               gone. DRIVER 1: Winningham, Nathan M (100394) VEHICLE 1: Wa.

               VEHICLE 2: INSURANCE: DAMAGE: WITNESS(ES): None NARRATIVE: On
               050214 around 0010 hrs I was dispatched to the Streit Perham
               parking lot for a report of a two car non injury accident. Upon
               my arrival I talked to Nathan M Winningham (100394) who told me
               the following. Winningham explained that he was making
               deliveries for Flix and had pulled into the Streit Perham
               Parking lot to make a delivery. Another vehicle had pulled in
               behind him so he pulled into a parking spot and believed he may
               have rubbed against another vehicle. He told me he looked at
               the other vehicle for damage and did not think he had caused
               any damage before returning to Flix and contacting his manager
               who contacted the police and returned to the scene with him. I
               asked if he had gotten the license plate of the other vehicle
               and he told me he did not. When asked about what the make and
               model of the vehicle was he didn't know. I then asked him if it
               was a sedan, SUV, or a truck, and he believed it was a sedan,
               but added that he isn't good with cars. After speaking with
               Willingham I looked at the area he described as possibly having
               been damaged by rubbing the other car. I noticed old damage
               from the front to the rear of the vehicle, but did locate what
               appeared to be a fresh rub mark on the rear passenger side
               quarter panel with what appeared to be white paint transfer.
               Upon closer inspection I notice there was a rub mark along
               rubber door ding preventer. I photographed the damage and
               provided Willingham with the case number for reference in
               completing his paperwork and asked if he had any questions. He
               had none and we discussed what to do in the future if he were
               to get into another collision and I cleared. The other vehicle
               in this case has yet to be identified and will await further
               information before proceeding. Nothing further at this time. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 2nd day of May, 2014 in Pullman,

               and I were dispatched to a report of two males actively
               fighting on Nevada St. As we were en route to the area Whitcom
               told us the males had moved down into the Stephenson Complex
               parking lot and were actively fighting again. As Boyd and I
               entered the area I could see a male, later identified as Jason
               E Hallman (062990), taking a boxers stance and radioed Boyd
               what I had seen. I pulled my patrol car around and as I
               approached I could see Boyd with the other male I had seen
               standing near Hallman, later identified as Cody J Cossano
               (102591). I walked up to where Hallman was at and noticed his
               right hand was covered with blood and he had a scratch on his
               nose as well as scratches on his back. I asked him what was
               going on and he explained the following. He and a friend, later
               identified as Nicholas V Dragt (071790) had been walking
               towards the Stephenson Complex from the area of Flix. As the
               were crossing Nevada St towards the Stephenson Complex, in the
               crosswalk, they noticed a vehicle coming at them at what he
               believed was a high rate of speed. Hallman and Dragt moved out
               of the way, but Hallman told me he believed that the driver,
               which he pointed out as Cassano, had intentionally swerved the
               car in their direction and almost hitting them. Hallman became
               upset and threw the cell phone he had been carrying, which
               belonged to Dragt, at Cassano's vehicle. Cassano immediately
               stopped his vehicle and exited, yelling at Hallman for throwing
               the phone and damaging his car. Both he and Cassano began to
               exchange words before thing eventually escalating to the point
               where punches were being thrown at one another. He went on to
               tell me that at some point Dragt pulled both he and Cassano
               apart at which point he walked down into the Stephenson Complex
               parking lot. Once down in the parking lot he told me that
               Cassano ran down the stairs at him, which was when I had
               initially noticed then, and the fight began again before both
               Boyd and I showed up. At this point I looked over to where Boyd
               and Cassano were talking and noticed that Cassano appeared to
               have a bloody face. I turned back to the individuals who were

               standing on the sidewalk near where Hallman was no seated and
               asked them if they had seen what had happened. Dragt told me he
               had been walking with Hallman when this incident occurred and I
               asked him to come speak with me and was told the following.
               Dragt's version of the events was similar to that of Hallman
               and I asked him how close Cassano had come to hitting them. He
               told me "damn close...way too close" at which point he added
               that Hallman became upset and threw his cell phone at Cassano's
               car. Once Cassano got out of his car and started yelling Dragt
               told him me he tried to reason with him but he was yelling
               about his car being damaged. Dragt offered to pay for any
               damage and Cassano wanted the money at that moment. Dragt told
               him he didn't have the money on him and Cassano continued to be
               verbally aggressive at which point Hallman started yelling
               back. He continued on and told me Cassano and Hallman then
               began to go after one another before he pulled them apart and
               Hallman walked down the stairs towards the Stephenson Complex
               where we eventually found them. Around this point he told me
               that Cassano then ran after Hallman and the two of them again
               began to physically fight one another at which point he tired
               to pull them apart which was when Boyd and I arrived. At this
               point a female, later identified as Aja B Smouse (062094),
               asked me if she could leave. I asked her if she had seen what
               had happened and she told me she was Cassano's girlfriend and
               had been in the car with him when everything had happened. I
               asked her to come over and speak with me while Dragt went to
               sit down by Hallman. Upon talking to Smouse she told me Cassano
               and her were heading back to her apartment, located at 540 SE
               Forest Wy, when Hallman had thrown something at the car. She
               told me Cassano had stopped the car and was in the process of
               exiting when she told him to stop. Cassano exited the car and
               she described the scene as Hallman and Cassano yelling at one
               another. She went on to tell me that she tried to get Cassano
               to stop, but told me she's "so little there isn't anything I
               could do." She went on to tell me that Dragt had broken things
               up and Hallman had walked down into the parking lot at which
               point Cassano ran down the stairs after him again, at which
               point they began fighting again. Dragt tried to break things up
               at which was when Boyd and I arrived. Around this point the
               Pullman Ambulance which Boyd had requested to be dispatched to
               our location arrived. As they came up to Hallman he refused
               treatment and told them he just had a few scratches. The
               ambulance crew then went off to speak with Boyd at which point
               I heard Boyd tell Whitcom that he would be testing Cassano. A
               short time later I heard him tell Whitcom that he would have
               him in custody for DUI. A short time later we spoke about this
               case and he told me Cassano did not want to pursue any criminal
               charges against Hallman. Boyd and I discussed this briefly
               before I returned to Hallman. Hallman and I discussed his
               actions in this case. He acknowledged that he may not have
               handled things in the best way but added that he did not want
               to pursue criminal charges against Cassano. I asked him if he
               was sure and he told me he was. We discussed the various laws
               surrounding this case and warning him about his behavior. He
               told me he understood and was released a short time later at

               which point I returned to Boyd. Boyd and I spoke briefly before
               he transported Cassano to the Pullman Police Department while I
               completed the tow form for Cassano's vehicle. At this point
               Hallman, Dragt, and Smouse were told they were free to go and
               Smouse collected her items and Dragt and Hallman left on foot,
               looking for Dragt's cell phone. A short time later Autobody
               Supercenter arrive and towed Cassano's vehicle. I cleared a
               short time later and upon my return to the WSU Police
               Department gave the tow form to Boyd for his case. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 2nd day of May, 2014, in Pullman,

               toned out a fight in progress on Nevada St. near Stadium Way.
               Officer Welter and I responded. Upon our arrival I could see
               two males, later identified as Cody J. Cossano (102591) and
               Jason E. Hallman (062990), who were both grappling and throwing
               punches at each other. Another male, Nicholas V. Dragt
               (071790), was attempting to break up the fight while a female,
               Anja B. Smouse (062094), was watching. The fight was occurring
               in the parking lot near Stephenson North, between Stephenson
               North and Nevada St. Dragt successfully separated Cossano and
               Hallman as I was approaching. I directed Dragt, Hallman, and
               Smouse to sit down on one side of the parking lot and Cossano
               to sit on the other side of the parking lot. Officer Welter
               arrived and began speaking to Hallman while I spoke with
               Cossano. I asked Cossano what was going on and he said he had
               been driving on Nevada St. when someone threw something at his
               vehicle. I noticed there was a vehicle stopped, running, in the
               middle of Nevada St. As I was speaking with Cossano I could
               tell he was intoxicated. His eyes were bloodshot and watery, he
               had a strong odor of intoxicants on his breath, and had
               difficulty maintaining his balance. After investigating the
               assault and having Cossano examined by ambulance personnel (see
               case #14-W1770) I asked Cossano if he would be willing to
               perform some voluntary field sobriety tests so I could make
               sure he was not impaired to drive. He agreed. The tests were
               administered on the sidewalk along the west side of Nevada St.
               at Stephenson Hall. The area chosen was straight and level.
               Light was provided by overhead street lights and my flashlight.
               Cossano was wearing tennis shoes, shorts, and a t-shirt. The
               approximate temperature was about 44 degrees. I told Cossano I
               would be evaluating him based on how well he followed my
               instructions as well as how he performed on the tests. Cossano
               said he understood. The first test I administered was the
               horizontal gaze nystagmus test. I told Cossano to stand with
               his feet together and his arms at his sides. I told him to
               follow the tip of my pen with his eyes only and not to move his
               head. Cossano said he understood. I confirmed Cossano's pupils

               were of equal size and his eyes tracked equally. I was unable
               to administer the test because Cossano refused to follow my
               pen, instead anticipating the movement of the pen and moving
               his eyes back and forth on his own. I instructed him several
               times to follow my pen and not just move his eyes back and
               forth but he refused to do so. The second test I administered
               was the nine step walk and turn. I told Cossano to imagine a
               straight line down the middle of the sidewalk. I told him to
               place his left foot on the line and to put his right foot in
               front of his left, touching heel to toe. I told him to keep his
               arms at his sides and to remain in this position while I
               explained the rest of the test. Cossano said he understood. I
               told Cossano to take nine steps, touching heel to toe down the
               imaginary straight line. I told him to look at his feet the
               entire time, keep his arms at his sides, and count each step
               out loud. I told him once he reached his ninth step to leave
               his front foot in place and to take a small series of steps
               with his back foot to turn around. I told him to take nine more
               steps back down the same imaginary straight line. I told
               Cossano it was a continuous test and once he started not to
               stop until he completed the test. I reminded Cossano to touch
               each step heel to toe, count each step out loud, look at his
               feet the entire time and keep his arms at his sides. I
               demonstrated the test and Cossano said he understood my
               instructions. As I was explaining the test Cossano was unable
               to maintain his balance and stepped out of the starting
               position. He also started the test too soon once. During his
               first nine steps Cossano used his arms for balance throughout.
               He missed touching heel to toe between steps 0/1, 4/5, 6/7, and
               8/9. He took 10 steps in his first 9 steps. Cossano stopped
               before turning. He turned improperly, moving both feet to turn.
               Cossano stumbled to his left while turning. He missed touching
               heel to toe between steps 2/3. He stepped offline to his right
               one step 3/4. Cossano missed touching heel to toe between all
               his remaining steps. The third test I administered was the one
               leg stand. I told Cossano to stand with his feet together and
               his arms at his sides. I told him to remain in this position
               while I explained the rest of the test and not to begin until
               instructed to do so. I told Cossano when instructed to begin to
               pick whichever foot he was most comfortable with and to lift
               that foot so his toe was approximately 6 inches off the ground.
               I told him to point his toe so the bottom of his foot was
               parallel with the ground and to keep both legs straight. I told
               him to keep his arms at his sides, look at his toe, and count
               out loud by 1000's (1001, 1002, 1003, and so on) until
               instructed to stop. I told him if at any point in time he put
               his foot down to pick it right back up and continue where he
               left off. I demonstrated the test and Cossano said he
               understood my instructions. Cossano started the test too soon
               once. He chose to stand on his right foot, raising his left.
               Cossano raised both arms for balance throughout the test and
               had both knees bent slightly. On his count of 1007 I reminded
               Cossano to look at his foot because he was looking at me.
               Cossano skipped from count 1010 to 1012. He counted 1015 twice.
               On his count of 1019 he hopped. Cossano counted to 1020 in 30

               seconds. At this time it was my opinion that Cossano's ability
               to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. I told
               Cossano he was under arrest for DUI and placed him in handcuffs
               (double locked). I advised him of his right to remain silent
               and his right to an attorney. Cossano began protesting, saying
               he was not drunk and wanted to do a breath test. I read Cossano
               his Constitutional Rights from a pre-printed card. He said he
               understood his rights and verbally waived his rights. I
               attempted to administer a PBT but Cossano refused to provide a
               proper sample. I transported Cossano to the Pullman PD holding
               facility for the breath test. Upon arrival at the PPD holding
               facility I found a plastic bag in his left pocket which
               contained three different pills. All three pills appeared to be
               prescription pills. I asked what they were and Cossano said
               they were adderall and admitted he did not have a prescription.
               I seized the pills as evidence. I checked Cossano's mouth at
               0204 hrs and found no foreign substances. I read him his
               Constitutional Rights from the DUI packet at 0205 hrs and he
               signed stating so. He also signed stating he was waiving his
               rights. I read Cossano his implied consent warning for breath
               at 0209 hrs and he signed stating so. I asked if he would
               submit to a breath test and he said yes. I checked the yes box
               on the DUI packet and had him initial next to it. I asked if he
               was confused by the implied consent warnings and he said no. I
               checked the no box on the DUI packet and had him initial next
               to it. I asked Cossano the questions from the DUI packet. He
               told me he does not use prescription drugs. He said he was not
               injured or involved in any collisions in the past 24 hours even
               though he had a swollen nose and cuts/abrasions from the fight
               he was involved in. Cossano admitted to having 3 beers. He
               thought he started drinking at about 2200 or 2230 hrs. He did
               not know when he finished drinking. When asked if Cossano
               thought his ability to drive was affected by his alcohol usage
               he said, "No". As we were waiting for the observation period to
               pass Cossano asked when he was going to be released. I told
               Cossano because he had the pills he was also going to be
               charged with possession of a controlled substance, which was a
               felony. I told him he would be booked into the Whitman County
               Jail. He said something to the effect of his life was ruined
               because of the felony and asked if it would be on his record. I
               told him if he was convicted it would be. He asked a question
               concerning conviction and I told him I could not promise
               anything but it was possible he could be offered the option to
               have the possession charged dropped if he pled guilty to the
               DUI. I told him that was not my decision and was up to the
               prosecutor. I recommended he speak with an attorney later and
               they could give him legal advice and help recommend a course of
               action. He asked to speak with an attorney so I contacted the
               on call public defender and allowed Cossano to speak with him
               until I saw him hang up the phone. I checked Cossano's mouth a
               second time at 0224 hrs and found no foreign substances. I
               checked the Datamaster instrument and found it in proper
               working order, with the RFI antenna attached, the breath tube
               warm to the touch, and the temperature display showing 34.00
               degrees. I waited for the observation period to pass. Cossano

               provided a breath sample of .133 at 0245 hrs and a second
               sample of .133 at 0248 hrs. The breath test was administered in
               accordance to the methods approved by the Washington State
               Toxicologist pursuant to the Washington Administrative Code. I
               provided Cossano with a copy of the breath test document, his
               hearing request form, and vehicle tow/impound form. I explained
               to Cossano when and where he could pick up his vehicle. I
               transported Cossano to the Whitman County Jail for booking.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 02 day of May, 2014, in
