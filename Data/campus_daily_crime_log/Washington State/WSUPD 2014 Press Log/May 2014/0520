               hrs I was dispatched to a report of a parking problem at the
               Student Recreation Center, located at 1105 NE North Fairway
               Road. I arrived on scene and contacted the complainant, Matthew
               S. Reisenauer (DOB 12-08-1984). Reisenauer is a WSU Parking
               Services employee. Reisenauer stated that he was patrolling the
               parking lot and found a vehicle that had not paid to park in
               the lot. Reisenauer noticed that the vehicle did not have any
               license plates, and the VIN was partially obscured. Reisenauer
               showed me the vehicle, and I saw that it was displaying an
               expired temporary Washington permit and a valid temporary
               California permit. I saw that a piece of paper had fallen
               between the dashboard and windshield and was covering up the
               first few digits of the VIN. The local operator of the vehicle,
               identified as Kalu C. Okeke (DOB 02-16-1989), arrived on scene
               and told me he had recently purchased the vehicle in California
               and was waiting to receive the title before registering it in
               Washington. The vehicle was identified as a silver, 2005 BMW
               sedan (CA Lic. 5NFM768). Okeke was able to remove the piece of
               paper from the dashboard. I gave Okeke a verbal warning for
               parking in the lot without paying. I cleared the scene. No
               further action at this time. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               on the wall between the 2nd and 3rd floors in red marker. I
               also noticed numerous spiders painted in black spray paint
               using a stensil throughout the stairwell. In the NE stairwell
               there were more black spiders throughout the stairwell. There
               were also several locations that had "Ish" written in black
               ink. I saw several more pictures in red marker on the wall, and
               a three locations between the 2nd and 3rd floors that were

               contacted the custodian Jerry Lynd who told me that the spiders
               showed up sometime since the beginning of the semester. He told
               me that the "Ish" graffiti is a couple of years old that has
               not been painted over. I asked him if the spiders and Ish

               He told me the pictures in the red marker pen showed up
               sometime since midnight on Thursday 05/15/14. I thanked him for

               XXYES NO OTHER UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 040814, Eileen
               reported an assault, case 14-W1400, that I was investigating.
               During my investigation of the other case, Eddy told me that
               Bedelu Dender punched her in the face in front of her class in
               Sloan Hall room 353. She told me she is a Teaching Assistant
               for a computer science 121 class that is held on Tuesdays and
               Thursdays. Eddy told me that on 031114 near the end of her
               class Dender entered her class and began yelling at her. He
               punched Eddy in the face because he was mad that she had
               witnessed him cheating in her Computer Science 460 class and
               she turned him in to Dmitry Dementyev who is the Teaching
               Assistant for that class. Dender left shortly after. Eddy
               showed me a letter that was written by Sakire Arslan Ay who is
               the Assistant Director of the School of EECS at WSU. The letter
               read: "On Tuesday March 25th EECS Undergraduate student Eileen
               Eddy has visited me and complained about EECS undergraduate
               student Bedelu Dender. She claimed that Bedelu has punched her
               in the face in Sloan 353, during Eileen's Cpts 121 lab session.
               She explained that Bedelu was angry with her because she
               claimed she had witnessed Bedelu Cheating in CptS 460 project
               and she informed the CptS 460 teaching assistant about it. And
               on Wednesday March 26th I met with Bedelu Dender and summarized
               with him Eileen's accusations. Bedelu Denied the above
               confrontation and explained to me that Eileen has been talking
               to other students about the cheating indecent and spreading the
               word around. He said he already talked to the CptS 460
               instructor Prof. K.C. Wang about his CptS 460 project and
               discussed the situation. I explained to both students that K.C.
               Wang needs to handle and resolve any cheating attempts in his
               class. He is responsible to report the cheating or plagiarism
               acts to WSU Academic Integrity Office. I also reminded them
               about the FERPA regulations and stated that education records
               of a student is protected under FERPA, and should not be
               revealed to any third parties. I also Advised Eileen to
               directly contact the campus police and report a complaint about
               the confrontation incident explained above." Eddy told me
               initially that she reported the incident to the police, but

               later told me she told Sgt. Sam Sorem with PPD about it at a
               church event. On 042414, Dmitry Dementyev came to the WSU
               Police Department to talk more about my overall investigation.
               He told me that he wasn't sure that Dender punched Eddy in the
               face in her class, and he asked me to go to the class in Sloan
               Hall room 353 and question the students in the class. I
               responded to Sloan Hall room 353 with Dmitry. He told me that
               there are two Teaching Assistants for the lab, Eddy and Kyle J.
               Vandelac. I opened the door and contacted Vandelac asking him
               if we could talk in the hallway. I asked Vandelac if he ever
               recalled Eileen being assaulted or having a confrontation with
               Bedelu Dender in the class. He told me he never witnessed
               anything, nor did he hear of any confrontation between the two.
               I asked him if he minded if I asked the class if anyone saw the
               confrontation that Eileen claimed to have happened in front of
               the class. He told me I could. I contacted the class and made a
               general statement asking if anyone had seen any verbal or
               physical altercation between a student and Eileen Eddy. All the
               students in the class appeared very confused and all shook
               their heads indicating the negative. On 050514, Eddy came to
               the Police Department with Alexander J. Fabrick to talk more
               about case 14-W1400. During our discussion, I asked Eddy about
               the assault in the classroom. I explained that I spoke with
               Vandelac and he didn't witness Dender punching her in the face.
               She stated that Vandelac was out of the room getting a drink of
               water. I explained to her that none of the students in the
               class indicated that they saw any assault or altercation of any
               kind between her and anyone. She responded saying that her
               students just don't talk to anyone. I asked her if she told
               Vandlac of the assault when he returned and she had not. On
               050614, I contacted Dender in his Mechanical Engineering
               classroom. I asked him about the assault and he told me he
               never went into her class. I told him Eddy claimed he came to
               her room on Tuesday 031114 around 1500 hours. Dender told me he
               has a class at that time he was in, and that he has been
               avoiding Eddy and Dementyev since he was accused of cheating by
               Dementyev. Dender told me that he has no idea why Eddy has it
               out for him, and he feels harassed. Based on the information in
               case 14-W1400 and this case, I don't feel there is any
               evidence, or witness statements, that substantiates Eddy's
               claim that she was punched in the face by Dender. Case
               inactive. See case 14-W1400 for more details on this case. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 20th day of May, 2014, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Kelly
