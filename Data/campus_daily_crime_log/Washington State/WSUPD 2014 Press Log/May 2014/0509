               Estimated at $500.00 WITNESS(ES): BLANKENSHIP, Betty A.
               (03/02/50)/WA NARRATIVE: On May 9, 2014 at about 0912 hours I
               was dispatched to a cold two vehicle collision. The reporting
               party wanted telephone contact. I was unable to make contact so
               I responded to WSU Food Services Office. I contacted both
               Schluneger and Blankenship at this location. They provided the
               same account of the incident. This morning, Friday, May 9, 2014
               at about 0745 hours the collision occurred. Blankenship had
               driven the white van to the Chinook Recreation Center building.
               This is not in a parking lot or street as it is within the
               Chinook Apartment Complex. Blankenship had parked the van and
               was opening the door to exit her vehicle. Schluneger was
               driving the green van. She attempted to pull up next to the
               white van when Blankenship began to open her door and the
               vehicles collided. The front passenger corner of the green
               van's bumper made contact with the white van's driver's door.
               The headlight assembly was also damaged on the green van. The
               employees reported the incident to their supervisor and were
               told to return to the office. There were no injuries. Digital
               photos of the vehicles were taken. No infractions or citations
               issued. No further investigation. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 10th day of

               was leaving his vehicle in the roadway while someone drove him
               to get fuel. I found the vehicle was in the turn lane near the
               curb of Vogel Plant Bioscience Building on Wilson Rd with its
               flashers on. Several cars were stopped behind it. I called
               Chris and left him a voicemail. After approximately five
               minutes, he returned with a gas can. While waiting for him to
               arrive, I observed his registration was expired. I spoke to him
               about leaving the vehicle and about the registration. I issued
               him a written warning for the registration. After putting some
               fuel in the vehicle, he was able to start it and drive away. I
               cleared. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under

               dispatched to a two (2) vehicle non injury collision in the
               Regents parking lot. I responded to the location. A WSU Parking
               and Transportation Services truck was illegally parked at the
               entrance to the parking lot. The truck was blocking the
               sidewalk on the north side of Colorado Street. The truck was
               parked perpendicular to Colorado. It was actually blocking the
               exit lane of the parking lot. The WSU Parking vehicle was not
               running, but occupied by two (2) employees, Paulsen and
               Reisenauer. The truck had on it's four (4) way emergency

               hour loading packing zone. The yellow GMC moving truck owned by
               the Storage Spot backed into the WSU Parking truck. The moving
               truck was in the parking lot attempting to park. The rear
               passenger corner of the moving truck collided with the rear
               driver corner of the WSU Parking vehicle. The taillight
               assembly on the WSU vehicle was broken. There was no new
               obvious damage to the back of the Storage Spot vehicle. I
               contacted the driver of the Storage Spot vehicle as well as the
               Parking Services employees. All provided similar accounts of
               the incident. I photographed the vehicles. Information was
               exchanged. Before clearing the scene I assisted the Parking
               employees with relocating their vehicle. No infractions or

               Campus St near Veterans Way when I observed a vehicle
               (WA/AGU9048) in the bus lane. The vehicle was not a bus. It
               appeared to be picking someone up. It then began driving again
               and moved into the appropriate lane but in doing so crossed the
               white line and cut me off. I activated my emergency lighs and
               stopped the vehicle in the Linden St. Crimson lot. I contacted
               the driver, Octavio Moren Preciado (011395), and he understood
               he should not be in the bus lane. His passenger, Daniel Can
               (030494), identified himself as he was the vehicle owner. The
               car smelled strongly of marijuana. Can admitted to "hotboxing"
               in the car earlier in the day. They both admitted to consuming
               marijuana and neither had a medicinal marijuana card. They said
               they smoked off campus. Can said there should only be a pipe
               left in the vehicle. He gave me permission to search the
               vehicle, knowing he could refuse, restrict, and rescind that
               permission. Intern Lee, conducted the search and could not find
               the pipe. I told them I would refer the two of them to Student
               Conduct for their drug activity. Moreno Preciado did not appear
               to be impaired to drive. They claimed to have smoked about 5

               someone had written, "Obama is a liar and a racist." The

               received a WSU Incident Report informing us of the event.

               ____NO OTHER UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 050914 swingshift
               received an email from Asst. Chief Hansen. It contained a WSU
               Incident Report detailing an injury sustained by an Austin D.
               Miles (121792). Miles had reportedly cut his hand while
               drunkenly punching a hole through a wall in Carpenter Hall.
               Asst. Chief Hansen requested we look into the isssue. The
               report stated in part "At 4:24 pm, Timothy Goheen emailed me
               asking for advice. He stated that a few minutes prior some
               drunk students were punching the false column by the entrance
               to the third year studio. They cut their hand on it and he was
               wondering what the policy was to report this type of activity.
               He didn't want to get anyone in trouble but was concerned for
               their safety and the productivity of the class mates. I
               informed Max Kirk, Interim Director, immediately and we went
               down to check it out. We found that Austin Miles had cuts all
               over his right hand and there was a larger hole in the fake
               column. We encouraged him to seek medical attention, but he
               refused. Max said he would need to repair the column in the
               fall when he returned to school (to which he agreed), and we
               asked if someone would make sure Austin got a ride home." The
               author of the report was Cheryl Scott, Administrative Manager.
               I called Timothy R. Goheen (051089) and left him a message. I
               then went to Carpenter Hall to assess the damage. En route I
               came across Goheen and he offered to show me the damage and
               tell me what he knew. Goheen stated that a friend of his,
               Miles, had begun "celebrating" a little early, and was in the
               3rd floor studio when he became belligerent. Goheen had been
               working and had headphones in and heard a commotion caused by
               Miles. He said Miles threw several punches into a faux column
               next to the studio entrance. There was already a pre-existing
               hole there. The hole Miles created is the one in the upper left
               of the pictures taken. Goheen told me that his roommate, Erfan
               Mehdibeik (031287) probably saw more of the event. He provided
               me with his phone number. On 051014 I returned to work and
               called Mehdibeik. His voicemail is not taking messages. I then
               left a voicemail for Miles to call me. The incident report is
               saved to the files in this case. Investigation continues. I
