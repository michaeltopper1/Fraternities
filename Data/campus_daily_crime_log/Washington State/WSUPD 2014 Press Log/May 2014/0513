               NARRATIVE: On 05-13-14 at approximately 0944 hours, Ofc.
               Olmstead and I responded to Avery Hall for the report of a
               possibly suicidal subject. Whitcom had the phone number for the
               office and we had them call in to the room to have the
               professor step out into the hallway. She did and she was
               identified as S.M. Tomie Gowdy-Burke. She stated the subject in
               her office, James, had displayed mental issues in the past but
               today he was told he was not going to pass his English 105
               class. James became upset and stated he was going kill himself.
               She stated he then made a gesture with his hand, like he was
               pointing a gun. He pointed it into his chest and made a motion
               like he was shooting it. She said he had also made a statement
               that if he couldn't do it himself that he would have someone
               else do it, like a cop. She asked if she could go in and tell
               him that we were there to help and I said yes. We went with her
               and when James saw us, he became upset. He stated he didn't
               want to get arrested. I explained to him I was there to help
               and stated he was not going to be arrested. I asked him what
               was going on and he at first said nothing. I asked him if he
               had been upset and he said yes. He stated he was failing a
               class and was depressed. I asked him if he wanted to hurt
               himself and he said yes. I asked him how he was going to do it
               and he shrugged his shoulders like he didn't know. I asked him
               if he had a plan and he said no. I asked him if he had said he
               was going to kill himself and he said yes. He put his face in
               his hands and became emotional. I explained to him several
               times I was there to help him. He stated he didn't want a
               record. I asked what he meant and he stated he got in trouble
               last time with his parents because he had a police record. I
               asked him if he was seeing a counselor and he said yes. I asked
               him when he last saw a counselor and he said last fall. He then
               stated he was taking medication. I asked him if he had taken it
               today, and he said he had forgotten to. I asked him if he would
               be willing to go to the hospital to be checked to make sure he
               was okay and he said no. He stated he had class at 1030. I told
               him I would explain to his professor why he missed class. He

               said he didn't want to go and would go later. I explained to
               him that since he had made the statements about hurting himself
               that I believed he needed to be evaluated. I advised him I
               would be taking him to the hospital and if he cooperated with
               me, I would not handcuff him. He stated he understood. I
               advised him that since he was going with us, I wanted to make
               sure he did not have any weapons on him and I had Ofc. Olmstead
               pat him down. I asked him if I could look in his bag to make
               sure there were no weapons in it and he said yes. I checked the
               bag and didn't see anything of concern. I saw his wallet and
               asked him if I could pull out his identification and he said
               yes. I found his WA ID card and he was identified as "James"
               Jun Beom Kwak. James walked with me to the vehicle and I placed
               him in the rear of the patrol vehicle. I transported him to PRH
               and filled out the Protective Custody Form which was signed by
               Dr. Scott. I then went to the Dean of Students and explained
               the situation to her. She stated she would send the professor
               of his current class an email to excuse him from class. A copy
               of the Protective Custody Form with the short synopsis I wrote
               on the back was sent to WSU Counseling Services. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               13th day of May, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 05-13-2014 at about 1231 hrs I was
               dispatched to a report of trespassing at the Steptoe
               Apartments, located at 1630 NE Valley Road. I arrived on scene
               and contacted the complainant, Gordon L. Lemper (DOB 07-24-
               1955). Lemper is an employee of WSU Housing Maintenance. Lemper
               advised that one of the apartment cleaning employees,
               identified as Rachid A. Badini (DOB 11-22-1989), was fired this
               morning. For more information, see case #14-W1987. After being
               fired this morning, Badini left the area but was recently
               observed in the Steptoe Apartments parking lot today at about
               1220 hrs. Lemper explained that some of the female apartment
               cleaning employees were concerned for their safety because of
               Badini's erratic, argumentative, and hostile behavior this
               morning. I told Lemper to instruct his employees to immediately
               call the police department if they observed Badini in the area
               again. I explained to Lemper that we would respond and trespass
               Badini from the Steptoe Apartments for the day. Lemper said his
               supervisor would be checking with Bob Tattershall, the director
               of WSU Housing Services, to pursue a permanent trespass order.
               No crime was committed. No further action at this time.

               NARRATIVE: On 051414 at approximately 0250 hours, Sgt. Macy and
               I were dispatched to a physical disturbance in the middle of
               Stadium Way near Perham Hall. Pullman PD also responded due to
               the report indicating the incident possibly being in PPD
               Jurisdiction. Upon arrival to the area of Lybecker and Stadium
               Way, I noticed two females in the middle of Stadium Way, face
               to face, with their arms straight out, and yelling at each
               other. I stopped my patrol car and as I was getting out, a male
               approached me and positioned himself in between me and the two
               females arguing. The male was later identified as Lynndryque
               Demmery, and the two females were identified as Jazmine Perkins
               and Krystal Melton. Melton and Perkins were bumping chests and
               were continuing to yell at each other face to face. I told
               Demmery to move out of my way and he told me "No". He had his
               arms out stretched to his sides to prevent me from getting past
               him. I again told him to get out of the way and he stated,
               "No!" and continued yelling. As I was yelling at him to get out
               of my way, I was walking toward him and we were within arm's
               reach of each other. He was back pedaling toward Perkins and
               Melton. I told Demmery several times to get out of my way and
               he refused each time. As I was telling him to move, I attempted
               to walk around him and he continued to position himself between
               me and the two females arguing. I had to grab Demmery by his
               arms and shove him out of my way in order to get past him to
               break up the verbal altercation. I shoved Demmery toward Ofc.
               Lambley as she approached, and she contacted him. WSUPD Intern
               Trevor Wolff grabbed Perkins and placed her in a gooseneck
               escort hold behind her back and I told Melton to come with me.
               At this point, I realized that my body camera wasn't recording
               and I activated my VieVu body camera. Melton told me that she
               and Perkins were walking home from the ZZU bar when they began
               arguing over her calling a taxi for a male that was following
               them. While I was talking to Melton, Perkins began yelling at
               Demmery who was very loud and non-compliant with Ofc. Lambley.
               I directed Intern Wolff to handcuff Perkins because she was
               attempting to pull away from Wolff and continue yelling at

               Demmery. Wolff handcuffed Perkins (DL) and I began talking to
               her to prevent her from yelling at Demmery. Shortly after
               contacting Perkins, I noticed Ofc. Lambley was trying to get
               past Demmery to contact Melton. I heard Ofc. Lambley tell
               Demmery to get out of her way and try to walk past him. He
               positioned himself between Ofc. Lambley and Melton. At that
               point, I grabbed Demmery, Ofc. Chamberlain handcuffed him and I
               double locked them. I told him he was being detained for
               Obstructing. I frisked Demmery for weapons and placed him in
               the back seat of Ofc. Lambley's patrol car. After the
               altercation between Perkins and Melton was sorted out, Ofc.
               Lambley asked me to release Demmery and explain how his actions
               obstructed our investigation and that he could be arrested for
               obstructing a public servant. Upon contact with Demmery, I
               began explaining that he was going to be released with a
               warning. Demmery became verbally aggressive toward me and Ofc.
               Lambley. He refused to listen to anything we had to say and was
               extremely uncooperative. At this point, I explained to Ofc.
               Lambley that he obstructed my ability to break up the argument
               between Melton and Perkins. Ofc. Lambley and I determined that
               there was probable cause to arrest Demmery for Obstructing a
               Public Servant. Ofc. Lambley advised Demmery he was under
               arrest and read him his rights. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               14th day of May, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.
