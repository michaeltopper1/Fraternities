               2, 2014 at about 0700 hours I was dispatched to a found parking
               permit at the Stephenson Complex Green parking lot. WSU Parking
               Services located a permit that had previously been reported to
               them as lost, displayed in a parked vehicle. The vehicle,
               209GCC/OR, a red 2001, Dodge Neon, was parked on the west side
               of the Green parking lot facing Stephenson North. WSU Parking
               personnel had the vehicle wheel locked upon my arrival. I saw
               three (3) WSU Parking Tickets posted on the vehicle's
               windshield. I was told that the permit had previously been
               reported as "lost" to the WSU Parking Services office. The
               vehicle was displaying a Blue 1 parking permit hanging from the
               rear view mirror. The back of the permit was blocked by air
               fresheners. It was difficult to read the front of the permit
               because of a necklace hanging down from the mirror. The parking
               personnel gently rocked the vehicle making the permit sway side
               to side. I could clearly see the entire permit number as it
               swayed. The permit in the vehicle was BL1 7765. I photographed
               the both the permit and vehicle then cleared the scene. I
               received an email from WSU Parking Services Administrative
               Operations Manager Aaron Colyar on this same day at about 0901
               hours. The email provided the information related to the lost
               permit. The email is as follows: Darren, Here is some
               information on the lost permit this morning. Permit Number:

               Alanzil is a student in the Intensive American Language Center
               at WSU. He is a citizen of Saudi Arabia. Alanzil is trying to
               sell his car on Craigslist. An unknown person has been
               communicating with him via email about the car. The potential
               buyer has told Alanzil that his representative will come and
               pick up the car. He wants to purchase it sight unseen. Alanzil
               received a check in the mail today from the unknown buyer. The
               check is dated 04/28/14. The check was written in the amount of
               $5640.55. Alanzil only wanted $3500.00 for his vehicle. The
               check was written on a business account from: St Media Group

               URGENTLY AS I COUNT ON YOUR HONESTY AND TRUSTWORTHINESS IN THIS
               TRANSACTION GOD BLESS YOU THANKS FOR THE UNDERSTANDING. ****END
               OF EMAIL**** This is an obvious fraud that Craigslist warns
               users about. The check was not cashed. Alanzil did not want
               anything to do with the check as he is not a US citizen and
               does not want any bad marks against his name. Alanzil still
               retains ownership and possession of his vehicle. He did not
               lose any money, only his time. Alanzil did not want to dispose
               of the check so he handed it to me. I have scanned the check
               and added it to the case file. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this ____ day of

               in Pullman for a skateboarding competition over the weekend. No
               one in the group lives in Pullman. Both driver's returned
               clear. I told the group that they were being trespassed from

               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W1794 SYNOPSIS: Young and Oneal
               were arrested for making a false or misleading statement to a

               Exhibiting. Both females are on the WSU women's soccer team.

               NARRATIVE: On 05/02/14 at approximately 2330 hours I was
               driving through the Ensminger Parking lot. While driving
               through the parking lot I saw a female, later identified as
               Mariah Rose Powers Young 08/01/94, facing the Grimes Way
               Playfields. Young was talking into the locked playfields. The
               playfields have an approximate 8 foot fence that closes off the
               field. When I passed Young I heard her say something to the
               effect of "be quite" as I passed. Believing that some one was
               trespassing in the playfield I turned around. As I drove back
               towards Young, I watched as a female, later identified as Ayana
               Charisse Oneal 11/24/94, jumped over the fence from the field
               side to the parking lot side. Oneal was clearly trespassing in
               the playfields. I pulled up to Young and Oneal who were quickly
               walking away from me. I told the two that I needed to talk with
               them. Both females stopped and they were detained (not
               handcuffed) for my investigation of the trespassing. I asked
               the two why they were in the playfields. Both females said they
               were on the WSU soccer team and they thought there was a soccer
               ball left on the field. The females were afraid if they had
               left a ball on the field after practice they would get in
               trouble by their coach. I asked the two if they had their ID's
               with them. Both said they did not. I asked Young what her last
               name was and she said "Jackson." I asked for Young's first name
               and she said "Maria" and her middle name started with an "S."
               Young provided the date of birth of 08/02/94. Young said her ID
               was through California. I asked Oneal what her last name was
               and she said, "Riley." I asked for her first name and she
               provided, "Andrea." Oneal said her middle name started with a
               "B." Oneal provided her date of birth as being 11/22/93. Oneal
               said her ID was through Oregon. Believing that the two were
               being honest with me I warned them for trespassing at the
               playfield. I told the two they were free to go. I returned to
               my patrol car and ran both names that were provided to me.

               Dispatch stated there was no record found for both females.
               Using my in car computer I looked up the WSU women's soccer
               team roster. I did not find either names on the roster. It was
               clear that both Young and Oneal lied about their names and
               dates of birth. I remained in the area of Ensminger to look for
               Young and Oneal. At approximately 2348 hours I located Young
               who was walking with Daquawn Deshon Brown 08/22/95. Both Young
               and Brown were walking towards Ensminger. I walked up to Young
               and told her I needed to talk with her again. Young stopped and
               I walked up to her and told her she was being detained. I
               reached for her right wrist and Young quickly pulled away.
               Young started to step backwards from me and I was able to grab
               the front of her tee shirt. Young continued to try and pull
               away from me. I was able to pull Young towards me. I was able
               to "C-step" and get Young off balance by moving her across my
               hip and assisted her to the ground. Young landed on the ground
               facing towards the sky. I was kneeling next to Young and I told
               her to roll over to her stomach which she did. I handcuffed
               (D/L) Young. I stood Young up and told her she was under arrest
               for lying about her name and date of birth. I advised Young of
               her right to counsel and placed her in the backseat of my
               patrol car. About this time Ofc. Boyd arrived on scene. After
               placing Young in the backseat of my patrol car I asked Brown
               where Oneal was. Brown said he did not know, she was probably
               at the dance. Brown started to walk away. I followed Brown
               believing that he would lead me to Oneal. We were walking
               toward Lighty when I asked for Brown to stop. Brown stopped and
               I asked Brown if he had his ID with him. Brown provided his WSU
               ID card. About this time Oneal walked up to us. I told Oneal
               that she was under arrest for lying about her name and date of
               birth. I handcuffed (D/L) Oneal and advised her of her right to
               counsel. I walked Oneal to my patrol and placed her in the
               backseat. I spoke with Young and Oneal for several minutes
               while they pleaded for their release. I explained several times
               that they were under arrest and that was not going to change. I
               transported Young and Oneal to Pullman Holding Facility were
               both were fingerprinted and photographed. I issued each a
               sector citation for RCW 9A.76.175 making a false of misleading
               statement to a public servant. I explained the citation to both
               and provided them with their copies. While processing Young she
               was argumentative and disrespectful. Young clearly understood
               she lied but felt that she did not deserve to be in trouble.
               Young was clearly unremorseful for her actions. When processing
               Oneal I could clearly smell the strong odor of intoxicants
               coming from her breath. Oneal was very cooperative after her
               arrest so I did not pursue charges of MIP Exhibiting. I
               notified WSU Athletics of Young and Oneal's arrest. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 3rd day of May, 2014, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer

               out and contacted the two, identified as Jonathan D. Sim
               (030692) and Colton M. Teglovic (111893). I spoke to them about
               walking in the roadway when a sidewalk was provided. We had
               moved to a safer alcove off the street. The two appeared to
               have been consuming alcohol based on their eyes and the odor
               coming from them. They provided identification. Sim was of age.
               Teglovic admitted he was underage. I checked his eyes and I
               observed a lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes and I could
               smell the odor of intoxicants on his breath. He provided a
               breath sample of .222. I told him I would refer him to Student
               Conduct for the alcohol and had the two cross the street. I
               told Teglovic to go straight home as he could still be

               damaged bathroom stall door and the other a stolen fire
               extinguisher. Both occurred between the same times, within 30
               ft of each other, and had the same RP and victim. I contacted
               RA Jacob W. Siebe (042793) who had found both issues. The
               bathroom stall door of the men's bathroom in the SE corner on
               the 4th floor had been broken off the hinges. Siebe had all
               pieces. I took pictures. Around the corner, a fire extinguisher
               had been taken out of it's unsecured location. Siebe said he
               had informed his chain of command about the issues. The fire
               extinguisher had been unsecured for about a week. I took
               photographs of the storage area of the fire extinguisher. It
               had not been damaged. Siebe had done rounds between 2300 and
               0030 hours, in that time the damage and theft occurred. He had
               no suspects or leads. I provided him with my card and the case
               number in case he heard anything on the hall. I cleared. Case
               closed pending developments. I certify and declare under

               05/03/14 at about 0106 hrs I was driving westbound on Orchard
               Dr. approaching Stadium Way when I noticed a vehicle that was
               driving Eastbound on Colorado St. The vehicle (WA 896ZKJ)
               caught my attention because as it turned Southbound on to
               Stadium Way it turned into the inside lane and not the closest
               (outside lane) as it should have. I initiated a traffic stop on
               the vehicle, turning on my over head lights. The vehicle
               stopped on North Fairway Rd. near Beasley Coliseum. I contacted
               the driver Malieva J. Hedberg (122895) and told her the reason
               for the stop and the stop was being recorded. I asked Hedberg
               for her driver's license, vehicle registration, and proof of
               insurance. Hedberg did not have her driver's license with her.
               I could smell the odor of intoxicants emitting from the car as
               I spoke with her. Hedberg denied having consumed alcohol. I had
               her exit the vehicle and asked if she would be willing to
               perform a series of voluntary field sobriety tests and she
               agreed. I administered the tests and could tell Hedberg had
               consumed alcohol but she was not impaired. Hedberg provided her
               name and date of birth, which I confirmed through Dispatch.
               Dispatch advised Hedberg had an ID card only and not a valid
               driver's license. I told Hedberg she was under arrest for NOVOL
               W/O ID. I advised her of her right to remain silent and right
               to an attorney. I placed her in the back of my patrol car and
               transported her to the Pullman Police Department for
               fingerprinting and photographing. I issued Hedberg criminal
               citation #C8702 for NOVOL W/O ID. I explained the citation to
               her, she received her copy, and was released. I provided her
               with a courtesy transport to Streit Hall. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 05 day of May, 2014, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer

               extinguisher. Both occurred between the same times, within 30
               ft of each other, and had the same RP and victim. I contacted
               RA Jacob W. Siebe (042793) who had found both issues. The
               bathroom stall door of the men's bathroom in the SE corner on
               the 4th floor had been broken off the hinges. Siebe had all
               pieces. I took pictures. Around the corner, a fire extinguisher
               had been taken out of it's unsecured location. Siebe said he
               had informed his chain of command about the issues. The fire
               extinguisher had been unsecured for about a week. I took
               photographs of the storage area of the fire extinguisher. It
               had not been damaged. Siebe had done rounds between 2300 and
               0030 hours, in that time the damage and theft occurred. He had
               no suspects or leads. I provided him with my card and the case
               number in case he heard anything on the hall. I cleared. Case
               closed pending developments. I certify and declare under

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 05/03/14 at approximately 0127 hours,
               Cougar Security unit Bucoda Warren radioed he just witnessed a
               hit and run. Warren said a silver car had just hit a parked car
               and was now heading westbound on Wilson Road heading towards
               Stadium Way. I was at the station when Warren was radioing
               about the hit and run. I ran to my patrol car and heard Warren
               say the silver car had just turned left onto Stadium Way
               heading southbound. Ofc. Petlovany and I left the station at
               the same time Ofc. Petlovany went down Wilson Road and I went
               down Troy Lane. When I reached Stadium Way I only saw one car
               on Stadium Way heading southbound. I pulled behind the car
               which was a silver Ford Taurus. I noticed there was damage to
               the driver's side rear bumper. There were scrapes in the paint.
               I radioed Warren and described the Taurus to him. Warren said
               that the car I described was the car that he witnessed. Based
               on the time and proximity of the car to the hit and run as well
               as Warren's information, I believed the Taurus to be the car
               involved in the hit and run. I activated my emergency lights
               and the Taruus turned right onto Nevada Street and came to a
               stop. I contacted the driver, Ahmed A. Abbas 03/01/90,
               identified myself, informed the driver I was recording, and
               asked Abbas if he knew why I had stopped him. Abbas said no. I
               explained that a Cougar Security person had seen him hit a car
               by Ensminger. Abbas said that was not him because he had just
               left from his house. I asked Abbas where his house was and he
               said on Morton St. Abbas was driving the wrong direction to be
               coming from Morton St. I told Abbas that I knew he was lying
               because people watched him leave Ensminger. I asked Abbas what
               happened when he left Ensminger. Abbas said he left because he
               was feeling sick. I asked Abbas to come talk to me outside the
               car. Abbas exited his car and when he stepped out Abbas had to
               put his left hand on the side of his car for balance. I asked
               for Abbas driver's license which he provided. I asked Abbas how
               much he had to drink tonight. Abbas said he had three shots at
               1900 hours. I asked Abbas if he was willing to do some
               voluntary standardized field sobriety tests. Abbas stated he

               would. The tests were conducted on a level and paved sidewalk
               on Washington St. near Nevada St. Abbas was wearing a button up
               shirt, jeans, and slip on cloth shoes at the time of the tests.
               The sidewalk was lit by street lights, patrol car spot light,
               and personal flashlight. I explained to Abbas that I would be
               evaluating him on how well he followed my instructions as well
               as how well he performed the tests. The first test I
               administered was the HGN test. I instructed Abbas to stand with
               his heels and toes together and keep his arms at his sides. I
               told Abbas to remain in that position while I administered the
               test. Abbas stated he understood. I told Abbas to follow the
               tip of my pen with his eyes only and not to move his head. I
               held my pen approximately 12-15 inches away from Abbas's head.
               During the test I observed, equal pupil size, equal tracking,
               and lack of smooth pursuit. As Abbas stood before me I could
               clearly smell the odor of intoxicants coming from his breath.
               The next test I administered was the walk and turn. I told
               Abbas to place his left foot on an imaginary line before him. I
               then instructed Abbas to place his right foot heel to toe in
               front of his left foot and keep his arms at his side. Abbas got
               into the starting position as instructed. I told Abbas to
               remain in that position as I gave further instructions. I told
               Abbas, when I tell you to begin, don't begin until I tell you,
               you will take a series of nine heel to toe steps down the line,
               with your arms at your side, looking down at your feet, and
               counting your steps out loud. Once you reach your ninth step
               leave your lead foot planted and with your rear foot take a
               series of small steps until you are facing where you came from
               and again take nine return heel to toe steps. I demonstrated
               the test for Abbas. I reminded Abbas to keep his arms at his
               side, count his steps out loud, look down at his feet, and do
               not stop the test until he had completed it. Abbas began to
               start the test and I told him I was not done explaining the
               tests. I asked Abbas if he understood and Abbas said he did. I
               asked Abbas if he would like me to demonstrate the test again
               and he said yes. I again demonstrated the test for Abbas. After
               demonstrating the test Abbas again started the test before I
               instructed him to do so. Instruction Phase: Abbas started the
               test early twice. Abbas also stepped out of the starting
               position once. First Nine Steps: Abbas missed heel to toe on
               step 9. Abbas continued to take steps till step 12. On step 12
               Abbas missed heel to toe and stepped off line. After step 12
               Abbas stopped and looked at me. After a few second Abbas said,
               "good?" I told Abbas to do the test as I had showed him. Abbas
               continued the test but did not do a turn. Instead Abbas started
               counting all over starting at one. Abbas took another 9 steps.
               Abbas took a total of 21 steps in one direction. Abbas never
               attempted a turn or the return 9 steps. The next test I
               administered was the One Leg Stand. I instructed Abbas to stand
               with his heels and toes together and keep his arms at his side.
               I told Abbas to remain in that position while I gave him
               further instructions. I told Abbas, when I tell you to begin,
               don't begin until I tell you, you will raise either leg of your
               choice and raise it six inches off the ground. You must point
               your toe so the sole of your shoe is parallel with the ground.

               While pointing your toe, keep your arms at your side, leg
               straight, look down at your foot and count out loud, one
               thousand one, one thousand two, one thousand three, and so on
               until I tell you to stop. If at any point you put your foot
               down, go ahead and pick it right back up and continue counting
               where ever you left off. I demonstrated the test and asked
               Abbas if he understood and he stated yes. I told Abbas to begin
               whenever he was ready. Abbas raised his right leg and began the
               test. As soon as Abbas raised his foot he had to immediately
               put it back down. Abbas raised his foot back up and continued
               the test. Abbas was not looking at his foot and after 3 seconds
               I told him to do so. Abbas stopped counting when I said this
               and put his foot down. Abbas tried to pick his foot back up but
               wobbled side to side for balance and had to put it back down.
               At 1010 Abbas used his arms for balance and hopped twice so he
               would not put his foot down. I told Abbas that the last test I
               had for him was the PBT. I explained what the PBT was, that it
               was voluntary, and it did not replace the evidentiary breath
               test. I found my PBT (Alco-Sensor FST #16805) in working
               condition. When Abbas started to provide his sample he was not
               blowing through the PBT properly. Abbas was clearly trying to
               prevent air to go through the PBT straw. On the third attempt,
               Abbas blew though the straw for about a second and I manually
               clicked the PBT to take the sample. On a very weak sample, the
               PBT displayed .067. Based on Abbas' field sobriety tests, It
               was my determination that Abbas' ability to drive was impaired
               by his alcohol consumption. I told Abbas that he was under
               arrest for DUI and handcuffed (D/L) him. I advised Abbas of his
               right to counsel and walked Abbas over to my patrol car where
               he was searched incident to arrest. Nothing of evidentiary
               value was found. I placed Abbas in the back seat of my patrol
               car. At some point during the search of Abbas my camera turned
               off. I turned the camera back on shortly thereafter. Ofc.
               Petlovany stayed with the vehicle and I transported Abbas to
               Pullman Police Department for BAC. Upon arrival I checked the
               Datamaster and found it working properly, with the RFI antenna
               attached, the mouth tube warm to the touch, and a temperature
               within ranges. At 0150 hours I checked Abbas's mouth finding no
               foreign substances. I read Abbas his Constitutional Rights at
               0152 hours. Abbas stated he understood his rights and signed he
               understood his rights and decided not to exercise his rights. I
               read Abbas the Implied Consent Warning for Breath and Abbas
               signed that it had been read to him at 0154 hours. Abbas stated
               he was willing to provide a breath sample. Abbas provided a
               breath sample of .086 at 0210 hours and another sample of .085
               at 0213 hours. The breath test was administered in accordance
               to the methods approved by the Washington State Toxicologist
               pursuant to the Washington Administrative Code. I told Abbas
               that he was over the legal limit and would be charged with DUI.
               I also told Abbas that he was being charged with Hit and Run. I
               asked Abbas why he did not leave a note on the car he hit.
               Abbas said that he did not think he hit the car. I told Abbas
               that his passenger was interviewed and the passenger said that
               they got out of the car to look at the car they hit for damage.
               Abbas said, "I did? I don't remember that." I asked Abbas if he

               was so intoxicated that he could not remember things. Abbas
               said, no he did not remember getting out of his car. Abbas
               said, "even after hitting, I just took off." Abbas said when he
               starts his car he has to put it in neutral and roll for a bit
               before the car will start. Abbas said that's why he hit the car
               behind him. I provided Abbas a copy of the following documents:
               Driver's Hearing Request, Fee Waiver form, Notice of
               Hearing/Conditions of Release, tow and impound form, and the
               breath test document. Abbas was issued Sector Citation
               4Z0495345 for RCW 46.61.502 DUI and RCW 46.52.010.1 Hit and Run
               Unattended Vehicle. I explained the citation and provided Abbas
               with his copy. Abbas was finger printed and photographed.
               Abbas's vehicle was impounded by Auto Body Super Center for 12
               hours. My VieVu camera footage was uploaded to the department's
               computer. Cpl. Kuhrt took photos of the damage to the car Abbas
               had hit and Abbas car. Cpl. Kuhrt left his business card on the
               car hit asking the owner to contact him. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               hall staff in the breeze way. I saw a small broken window. The

               NARRATIVE: On 05/03/14 at approximately 0252 hours I was
               traveling eastbound on NE Colorado St at Bohler Gym. I saw the
               defendant's vehicle traveling westbound towards me. I activated
               my vehicle's radar (Veh 41) and it displayed a speed reading of
               28MPH in a 20MPH speed zone. I turned behind the vehicle and
               activated my emergency lights, stopping the vehicle near PEB. I
               activated my VieVu camera and contacted the driver. I told the
               driver the stop was being recorded as well as the reason for
               the stop. I asked the driver for his license, registration, and
               proof of insurance. The driver provided me with his license,
               identifying him as Grant R. martin 11/16/94, and insurance and
               began looking for his registration. I noticed an open Keystone
               Light can in the center console. None of the occupants appeared
               over the age of 21. While Martin continued looking for his
               registration I asked the two passengers if they were 21 and
               both said they were under 21. I asked Martin who the beer
               belonged to and he said he would take the blame for it. Martin
               had still not provided me with his registration, which I
               eventually found for him. Martin handed the beer to me. I felt
               the can was cold and when I poured out some of the contents it
               was foamy, indicating it was fresh. Ofc. Boyd arrived on scene
               around this time. I noticed Martin was dropping items and he
               fumbled through his wallet for his ID. Martin's speech was slow
               and deliberate and I could smell the odor of intoxicants on his
               breath as he spoke. I saw that Martin's eyes were watery. While
               standing at the car I could also smell the odor of marijuana. I
               asked the occupants if anyone had a medical marijuana card and
               they all said they did not. I asked Martin how much marijuana
               was in the car. Martin looked at the center console and said
               none. I told Martin that was not the case. I asked again and
               Martin produced a stem from a bong and handed it to me. I told
               Martin that was not the odor I smelled. Martin then removed a
               large bong from the passenger side floor board. I told Martin
               that was not marijuana either. Martin eventually removed a
               sandwich bag from the center console, which contained
               marijuana. I asked Martin how much alcohol he had to drink.
               Martin thought for a moment and then said he had 4 beers. I
               asked Martin if he felt ok to drive and he said he did. I asked

               Martin if he would perform some field sobriety tests to see if
               his ability to drive is affected by his alcohol consumption.
               Martin said he would and exited the vehicle. I directed Martin
               to the sidewalk on the south side of the roadway. I placed the
               beer, marijuana, and stem on the hood of my car. I went over to
               Martin and explained I would be evaluating him on how well he
               performed the tests and how well he followed my directions. I
               administered the field sobriety tests on the level and paved
               sidewalk. Lighting was provided by ambient building lights and
               my flashlight. The weather was clear with an approximate
               temperature of 50 degrees. Martin was wearing shorts, a t-
               shirt, and shoes during the tests. The first test I
               administered was the HGN. I told Martin to stand with his feet
               together and his arms at his sides. I told Martin to follow the
               tip of my pen with his eyes only with out moving his head. I
               held my pen approximately 12-15 inches in front of Martin's
               face and administered the test. I checked Martin's eyes and
               noticed they tracked equally and his pupils were equal in size.
               I did not see resting nystagmus in either eye. I saw a lack of
               smooth pursuit and a distinct and sustained nystagmus at
               maximum deviation in both eyes. I saw an onset of nystagmus at
               approximately 40 degrees in both eyes. The next test I
               administered was the walk and turn. I told Martin to find an
               imaginary straight line and put his left foot on the line. I
               told Martin to put his right foot in front of his left foot
               touching heel to toe and leave his arms down at his sides. I
               told Martin to stay in that position while I explained the
               test. I told Martin that when I tell him to begin, to take nine
               steps touching heel to toe, watching his feet as he walked and
               count each step out loud. I told Martin that when he gets to
               step nine, to leave his lead foot in place and using his rear
               foot, take small steps around until facing the way he came. I
               told Martin to take nine steps back touching heel to toe and
               counting each step out loud. I told Martin that once he
               started, do not stop. I reminded Martin to count each step out
               loud, keep his arms at his sides, and watch his feet as he
               walked. I demonstrated the test and asked Martin if he
               understood and he said yes. I told Martin to begin at any time.
               Instruction Phase: Martin stood with his left foot in front of
               his right foot, opposite of what I demonstrated and explained.
               First Nine Steps: Martin began the test and stepped off line to
               the right on steps 1, 3, 5, and 7. Martin stepped off the line
               to the left on step 2. Martin missed heal to toe between steps
               1 & 2. Martin performed an improper turn by taking steps with
               both feet. Return Nine Steps: Martin began his return steps and
               stepped off line to the right on steps 2 and 4. Martin stepped
               off line to the left on steps 3, 5, and 6. Martin missed heel
               to toe between steps 6 & 7. Martin returned on a line that was
               45 degrees away from the original line. The next test I
               administered was the one leg stand. I told Martin to stand with
               his feet together and his arms at his sides. I told Martin that
               when I tell him to begin to raise the foot of his choice
               approximately 6 inches off the ground. I told Martin to point
               his toe forward, look at his foot, and count out loud by 1000's
               until I tell him to stop. I told him that if he happens to put

               his foot down, to pick it back up and continue from where he
               stopped. I asked Martin if he understood, and he said yes. I
               told Martin to begin at any time. Martin raised his left foot
               approximately 2 inches and began the test. Martin swayed left
               to right during the test and counted 1, 2, 3 etc. Thirty
               seconds elapsed on Martin's count of 25. The next test I
               administered was the PBT. I told Martin the PBT did not replace
               the evidentiary breath test and it was voluntary. I asked
               Martin if he would submit to a PBT and he said yes. I checked
               the PBT (FST # 62324) and found it in proper working condition.
               Martin gave a breath sample of .144 at 0307 hours. At this time
               it was my opinion that Martin's ability to drive was impaired
               by alcohol. I handcuffed (D/L) Martin and advised him of his
               right to counsel. I searched Martin incident to arrest, finding
               no weapons or items of evidence. I placed Martin in the back
               seat of my patrol car. Ofc. Boyd watched while I poured out the
               beer in the roadway. While administering the tests, I heard the
               stem fall off my hood into the roadway. While walking back, I
               kicked the stem and it went under the fence into the
               construction site. Ofc. Boyd facilitated the tow with Meyers
               towing. I transported Martin to Pullman PD for the BAC. I
               reminded Martin that I was recording. Upon arrival I checked
               the Datamaster and found it working properly with the RFI
               antenna attached, the mouth tube warm to the touch, and a
               temperature within acceptable ranges. I read Martin his
               Constitutional Rights at 0322 hours. Martin said he understood
               his rights and signed both signature blocks. I checked Martin's
               mouth at 0322 hours, finding no foreign substance. I read
               Martin his Implied Consent at 0324 hours. Martin signed that it
               was read to him and he said he understood the warnings. I asked
               Martin if he would submit to a breath test. Martin checked the
               "yes" box and initialed next to it. Martin provided a breath
               sample of .144 at 0341 hours and a sample of .148 at 0344
               hours. The breath test was administered in accordance to the
               methods approved by the Washington State Toxicologist pursuant
               to the Washington Administrative Code. I provided Martin with a
               copy of the following documents: Driver's Hearing Request,
               Notice to Appear/Conditions of Release, Breath Test Document,
               and the Tow/Impound Form. I completed a citation for DUI. I
               explained the citation to Martin and provided him his copy. I
               released Martin from custody and gave him a courtesy transport
               to Stephenson Complex. I returned to WSUPD and logged the
               marijuana into evidence for destruction and I downloaded the
               video to the computer. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 3rd day of May, 2014,
               in Pullman, Washington. _______________________________________
