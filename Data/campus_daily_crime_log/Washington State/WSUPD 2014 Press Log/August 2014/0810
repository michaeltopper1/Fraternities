    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: JAK/333 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W2816 SYNOPSIS: 3 spots of graffiti were
               spray painted on the back side of the old WSU Power Plant.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 08-10-
               14, at approximately 1024 hours, Whitcom dispatched me to a
               Malicious Mischief on the back side of the old WSU Power Plant.
               I responded to the old WSU Power Plant and contacted Brian L.
               Intermill (06-30-67). Intermill said there had bee 3 separate
               spots which had been spray painted, in red spray paint, on the
               back side of the Power Plant. He also showed me a can of red
               spray paint laying on the ground on the front side of the power
               plant. I took photographs of the areas which were spray
               painted, collected the can of spray paint, and gave Intermill
               my business card with a Police Case number on it. I asked
               Intermill to call me if he developed any leads on who may have
               done the spray painting or if he found more graffiti. I dusted
               the can of spray paint to see if I could lift any finger prints
               off of it, but I was unable to do so as there was a hole in the
               side of the can with some paint still coming out of it. I threw
               the can in the garbage as it was of not evidentiary value and
               cleared the scene. Once back at the WSU Police Department I
               downloaded the photos onto the WSU Police computer system. It
               will cost approximately $75.00 to clean the spray paint off of
               the power plant. Intermill said he would contact WSU Facilities
               Operations to have the spray paint cleaned off of the building.
               No suspects or leads. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 10th day of August,
               2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W2818 SYNOPSIS: Hsu issued two NOI's for
               failure to yield for emergency vehicle and no headlights after
               dark. Hsu drove for one mile with my emergency lights and siren
               activated. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Chin Shih
               Hsu 12/05/86 NOI Issued Traffic 2. NARRATIVE: On 08/10/14 at
               approximately 2233 hours I was driving eastbound on Colorado
               street when I noticed a gray Nissan Altima heading eastbound on
               Colorado near Stadium Way. As the Nissan went through the
               intersection of Colorado St and Stadium Way I noticed the
               vehicle did not have it's headlights on. I caught up to the car
               just as it crossed onto Orchard Drive and I turned on my
               emergency lights. The car was going approximately 25 MPH and
               was not slowing down. I turned on my siren as we paralleled
               Beasly Coliseum. Still the Nissan did not slow down and
               continued northbound on Orchard Drive. The Nissan drove Orchard
               to Valley Road, Valley Road to Brandi Way, and turned right
               into the Steptoe Apartment Complex. As we turned into Steptoe
               Ofc. Boyd caught up to us. Once inside the parking lot of
               Steptoe Village the Nissan came to a blocked off area due to
               construction. The Nissan attempted to do a U-turn but was
               unable to because of Ofc. Boyd's and my patrol cars. I exited
               my patrol car, unholstered my handgun and ordered the driver to
               put his hands out the window. The driver, later identified as,
               Chin Shih Hsu 12/05/86, did so. Ofc. Boyd and I approached the
               Nissan and I holstered my handgun and transitioned to my taser.
               Ofc. Boyd grabbed ahold of Hsu's right arm and I grabbed Hsu's
               left arm. Ofc. Boyd opened the car door and we told Hsu to get
               out of his car. About this time my VieVu camera was turned off
               by the car door hitting it. With Ofc. Boyd on Hsu's right and
               me on Hsu's left, I told Hsu to put his hands behind his back.
               Hsu was activily resisting. I could feel Hsu tense up his bicep
               in an attempt to overcome my control. I told Hsu to get on the
               ground but he did not. Ofc. Boyd and I assisted Hsu to the
               ground where we attempted to handcuff Hsu. Again we ordered Hsu
               to put his hands behind his back. Hsu was continuing to resist
               Ofc. Boyd by keeping his arm straight and tensed. I was able to
               place Hsu's left arm into a gooseneck control hold. After I
               applied some pressure on the gooseneck Hsu put his right arm
               behind his back. Hsu was handcuffed (D/L). I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               socializing. I spoke to the four, who were not identified, and
               explained that someone had called complaining about their noise
               level. The males apologized profusely and said they would go

               hours, Ofc. Boyd and I responded to the WSU Steam Plant were a
               FacOps employee was reporting several people inside the
               building. Upon arrival Ofc. Boyd and I met with the reporting
               party, Daniel W. Richards 01/16/79 who stated that he could
               hear several voices coming from up within the scaffolding and
               roof area. Ofc. Boyd went with Richards as I drove around the
               eastside of the Steam Plant. As I came near the side of the
               building I saw three people standing near a staircase that
               leads to a lower level of the Steam Plant. I told the three to
               stop and sit on the ground. The three did as I asked. The three
               individuals were later identified as, Samantha Gabriele Kieling
               08/01/94, Dauson Michael Crawford 06/28/91, and Margaret
               Elizabeth Stafne 10/11/94. I started to ask the three what was
               going on when I noticed three individuals on the northeast
               corner of Steam Plant's roof. I yelled at the three to come
               over to me but they jumped off the roof and ran around the
               northside of the building. I radioed Ofc. Boyd of the three and
               moments later Ofc. Boyd radioed he was in a foot pursuit with
               one of the subjects. I had dispatch request two Pullman PD
               Officers to respond. Ofc. Chamberlin and Ofc. Engle assisted
               Ofc. Boyd in the search of the male who ran. I asked Kieling,
               Crawford, and Stafne who was on the roof. Crawford provided the
               names, Michael Joubert and Larry Willett. Stafne provided the
               name Alexandra Woodford. I asked Kieling, Crawford, and Stafne
               to tell me what happened from the beginning. Kieling said there
               were a bunch of people over at their house, 1045 NE Duncan St,
               and some of the people wanted to go look at the Steam Plant.
               Kieling said there was around 9 people originally at her house.
               A group of somewhere between 6 and 9 people walked to the Steam
               Plant with the intention of getting in the building. Once at
               the Steam Plant some people went onto the roof using the
               northeast corner of the roof. I asked Kieling, Crawford, and

               Stafne if they had gone on the roof. The three said they were
               walking over to the area to talk to the people who were already
               on the roof but none of them actually went onto the roof. When
               I found Kieling, Crawford, and Stafne, They were near the fence
               line that leads to the northeast corner of the Steam Plant
               roof. However I never saw Kieling, Crawford, or Stafne on or
               attempting to gain access to the roof of the building. I pulled
               Kieling aside from the group and asked her how much she had to
               drink. Kieling said she had a few beers. I asked Kieling if I
               could check her eyes and she said I could. I performed an HGN
               test on Kieling. During the test I observed, equal pupil size,
               equal tracking, lack of smooth pursuit, and distinct and
               sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes. I asked
               Kieling to blow into my hand. Kieling did so and as she
               breathed out I could clearly smell the strong odor of
               intoxicants coming from her breath. I asked Kieling if she
               would be willing to provide a PBT sample and she said she
               would. I found my Alco-Sensor FST (#16805) in working
               condition. I asked Kieling where she believed she would land on
               a BAC scale. Kieling said probably around a 0.09. I told
               Kieling that would equate to somewhere around 4 to 5 beers.
               Kieling nodded her head in agreement. Kieling provided a PBT
               sample of .071. I told Kieling to return to the other two. I
               next spoke with Stafne and asked her how much she had to drink.
               Stafne said she had one Bud Light beer about two hours ago. I
               asked Stafne if I could check her eyes and she said I could. I
               performed an HGN test on Stafne. During the test I did not
               observe any signs of HGN. I asked Stafne if she was willing to
               provide a PBT sample and she said she would. Stafne provided a
               PBT sample of 0.00. I did not question Crawford about his
               alcohol consumption because he is 23 years old. I told Crawford
               and Stafne that they were free to go. Once Crawfrod and Stafne
               walked away I told Kieling that I would be forwarding charges
               of MIP Exhibiting to the prosecutor. I told Kieling how the
               process works and asked if she had any questions. Kieling said
               no. I told Kieling she was free to go. About this time Officers
               Boyd, Chamberlin, and Engle had completed their search for the
               remaining 3 individual and had not found anybody. I asked Ofc.
               Chamberlin to respond to 1045 NE Duncan Lane where I believed
               the three would wander back to. Ofc. Boyd, Ofc. Engle, and I
               searched the Steam Plant for other individuals. During our
               search we did not find anybody else in or on the building.
               While completing out search, Ofc. Chamberlin radioed that when
               he arrived at 1045 NE Duncan several people ran into the house
               when they saw him. Ofc. Boyd and I responded to 1045 NE Duncan
               and upon our arrival, found Ofc. Chamberlin speaking with
               Kieling, Larry Jordan Willett 07/01/92, and Alexandra Paige
               Woodford 07/16/92. All three were standing in the driveway of
               1045 NE Duncan. Ofc. Chamberlin said he had spoken to Willett
               and Woodford who said they were at the Steam Plant. I noticed
               Willett was wearing white jean shorts and a white tank top.
               Both were covered in dirt as if he had been running through
               fields. Ofc. Boyd interviewed Willett to determine if he had
               been the one who he had chased. See Ofc. Boyd's supplement for
               further details. Willett later stated that he was on the roof

               and did run when the Police showed up but he was not the person
               who was running from Ofc. Boyd. I told Kieling, Willett, and
               Woodford that I would make them a one time offer. The offer was
               that if everybody involved showed up and provided their
               information I would refer them all the student conduct instead
               of arresting them. All three said they like that offer. I told
               the three to get everybody left in the house to come out so we
               could finish the case up. Stafne and Crawford came out of the
               house to join, Kieling, Willet, and Woodford. I asked the five
               where Michael Corey Joubert 07/29/91 was. Crawford said Joubert
               never came back to the house. Crawford said he called Joubert
               but he did not answer his phone. Crawford tried to call Joubert
               again but he did not answer. Crawford left a voicemail
               instructing Joubert to call me. Due to the fact that Ofc. Boyd
               and I were unable to positively identify any of the people on
               the roof I told the group that they would be referred to
               student conduct and were being warned for trespassing. All five
               stated they understood. Ofc. Boyd, Ofc. Chamberlin, and I all
               cleared from Duncan Lane. Charges of MIP Exhibiting will be
               forwarded to the prosecutor against Samantha Kieling. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 11th day of August, 2014, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer
