               injuries. I asked what happened and Shelly stated she had been
               traveling up Stadium Way and noticed traffic in the outside
               lane stopped suddenly. She then saw a pedestrian in the

               time of the collision and there was no airbag deployment.
               Raymond's vehicle had significant damage to the front end and
               the hood was buckled. There was significant damage to the rear
               end of Shelly's vehicle. Photographs of the vehicles were taken
               and I helped the two drivers exchange information and provided
               them with a business card and case number. I did not issued any
               tickets but did warn Raymond for following to closely. I
               cleared. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under

               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: I received a phone
               call from Dispatch asking me to call them regarding a possible
               cold assault. I was asked to call (253) 307-5609 and speak with
               Alex Gauther (a hall staff member for Rogers Hall). I called
               Gauther and asked what I could do for him. He said one of his
               Rogers Hall residents, Andrew C. Huh (04-16-14) said he was
               assaulted by Delaney L. Harris (04-16-96). He said he and
               Harris were walking into Rogers Hall via the North ground floor
               door. Huh said Harris was listening to music via head phones.
               He asked Harris what he was listening to and he could not hear
               him so he tapped him on his shoulder to get his attention and
               ask what he was listening to. Huh said Harris "Freaked out" and
               began punching him. I asked Gauther if Huh would be willing to
               speak with me and report the assault. He said he would speak
               with him and get back to me. Gauther called me back stating Huh
               is willing to report the assault to the Police, but he had
               recently left Pullman and went to Spokane. He said he would be
               back in Pullman sometime around 1900 hours on 08-22-14 and
               would contact the Police. I left the case number with Gauther
               and asked him to relay it to Huh prior to him contacting the
               Police. Investigation continues. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 21st day of

               about 2128 hrs I was dispatched to a report of a possible hate-
               bias incident in Stephenson East, located at 1265 SE Stadium
               Way. I arrived on scene and contacted the complainant, Cameron
               M. Radka (DOB 08-15-1995). Radka is a resident advisor for
               Stephenson East. Radka showed me the dry erase board displayed
               on the door to room #1327. Radka stated that someone had drawn
               an image of a penis on the board, but it had already been
               erased. Radka had previously photographed the drawing, and I
               requested that he forward the photograph to me. The photograph
               was later downloaded into Spillman. Radka estimated that the
               image was drawn on the dry erase board sometime between 1909
               hrs and 2125 hrs on 08-21-2014. I contacted the residents of
               room #1327, who were identified as Alyssa A. Montoya (DOB 02-
               26-1996) and Elexys C. Webster (DOB 05-25-1996). Montoya and
               Webster stated that they were not offended by the obscene
               drawing on their white board. Montoya and Webster said they had
               no idea who might have drawn the image on the board. No
               criminal offense had been committed. I request that this report
               be forwarded to the WSU Title IX Coordinator. No further action
               at this time. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this __21__ day of
               __August____, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: 316 / Macy WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W2993 SYNOPSIS: The odor of marijuana was
               reported coming from room 514 of Goldsworthy Hall. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 8/21/14 at
               about 2355 hours Officer Olmstead and I responded to
               Goldsworthy Hall, room 514, due to the odor of marijuana being
               detected by Hall Director Joshua McPhatter. On our arrival at
               room 514 the odor of marijuana was not detected outside of the
               door. When I knocked on the door it was open about two inches.
               I asked the individual, who was looking through the gap, if I
               could talk to the residents of the room. The eye looking
               through the gap disappeared at which time I could here things,
               sounded like cans, being moved around inside the room. Even
               with the door open I could still not detect any odor of
               marijuana. After about 30 seconds residents Tanner C.
               Richardson and Shayne K. Fontes stepped out into the hallway
               shutting their door behind them. I explained to them why we
               were there. They both stated that there was no marijuana, nor
               had any been smoked, in the room. I did not smell any odor of
               marijuana on either subject and I did not observe any signs
               from them that they had been smoking. I also did not smell any
               odor of alcohol coming from them. When I ask why someone may
               have smelled the odor of marijuana coming from there room
               Fontes said he may have been around someone at another location
               who may have been smoking, but he had not and it was not in
               their room. The possible consequences of such actions in their
               room, or anywhere, at their ages were discussed. No odor, or
               any other sign, of marijuana being smoked in room 514 was
               detected or observed. No further action at this time. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.

               responded to the area and saw two subjects matching the
               description given walking across Campus St. between Duncan Dunn
               Community and Wilmer Davis Halls. I contacted the subjects,
               Emily E. Robinson and Sean F. Foy. They told me they were just
               on a walk to work out some issues and talk. They did not want
               to give any details but I did not see any indication of
               anything other than a verbal argument. Neither one appeared to
               be distressed and I saw no indication of a physical
               altercation. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 22 day of
               August, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.
