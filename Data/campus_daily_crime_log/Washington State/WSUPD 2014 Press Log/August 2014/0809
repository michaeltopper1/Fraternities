               The investigation is ongoing. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE

               1158 hours, Natalie R. Florez (11-07-75), called Whitcom and
               said she wanted to speak with an Officer regarding harassing e-
               mails she has been receiving. I responded to the Kamiak
               Apartments, apartment H-3, to speak with Florez. I asked her
               what I could do for her and she told me she had contacted an
               upholstery shop, located in the Seattle area, regarding work
               she wanted done to her vehicle. She said the shop could not
               accommodate her job request, but continued contacting her via
               e-mail. She said she has requested the shop stop e-mailing her,
               but they continue to do so. She said at least one of the e-
               mails contained a threat to "Knock her (Natalie's) teeth out"
               Florez said she wants to stop being harassed by the shop, wants
               the e-mails to stop, and wants charges filed for RCW 9A.56.020,
               Harassment and RCW 9.61.260, Cyber stalking against the person
               who sent the e-mails and is harassing her. Florez said she
               would forward all of the e-mail correspondence she has had with
               the sender, known only to me at this time as "Erica". On 08-09-
               14, at approximately 1450 hours, I called Rich's Custom
               Upholstery at phone number (206) 392-0030 and asked to speak
               with Erica. I was told Erica does not work on the weekends, but
               could be contacted Monday through Friday. Investigation
               continues. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 9th day of August, 2014, in Pullman,
