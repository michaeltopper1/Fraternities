               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W3182 SYNOPSIS: Request for assistance
               from the Whitman County Sheriff's Office for a physical
               domestic. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 082014 around 1049 hrs Whitcom requested Ofc Olmstead and I
               respond to 303 North Main St in Albion to assist the Whitman
               County Sheriff's Office with a physical domestic in progress
               involving two males. Olmstead and I responded and upon my
               arrival I noticed the address provided had two apartments
               assigned to it and requested clarification from Whitcom. While
               I was awaiting a response from Whitcom, Olmstead arrived. I
               approached apartment #2 at the address and could hear movement
               from inside and knocked on the door. An unidentified male
               answered the door and explained that the couple we were looking
               for lived at 305 North Main St. He went on to explain this is a
               regular occurrence between the male and female that live there
               and something needed to be done. I told him I understood and
               asked him if he saw the fight. He told me he did not want to
               get involved since he has to live next door to them, but later
               added that he had seen the female, later identified as Brianna
               M Smith (102068) hit the male, later identified as Michael A
               Nyberg (102861), with a telephone. He continued and explained
               Nyberg had been yelling for Smith to stop hitting him. At this
               point the male again told me he did not want to get involved. I
               told him I understood and thanked him for his help before going
               to speak with Olmstead. I told him the correct address and
               moved over towards the front door. Through the window I could
               see a television set on, but saw no movement. I knocked on the
               door several times and announced that I was with the police
               department. Nobody came to the door and I moved to the side
               door and again knocked with no response. At this point I went
               to speak with Olmstead and let him know what I had seen and
               heard from inside the house. He went to contact Whitcom while I
               spoke with the reporting party, later identified as Sandra M
               McCollum (030361), who told me the following. McCollum
               explained that she had seen what she believed was two males
               arguing in the front yard of what I identified as 305 North
               Main St. She went on to tell me the males were yelling at one
               another and walking around the corner of the house and out of
               her sight in the direction of 303 North Main St. I thanked her
               for her time and returned to Olmstead. Around this point he
               told me Dep. Melcher was approximately 2-3 minutes away and we
               established a perimeter around the house until he arrived. Upon
               his arrival we briefed him and it was decided to enter the

               residence for safety and we approached the front door. Melcher
               knocked and announced our presence without a response. After a
               short period of time we walked around to the side door at which
               point Melcher knocked and announced again, without a response.
               He checked the door handle and found it to be unlocked and upon
               opening the door he yelled inside for the occupants to come out
               and that he was with the Sheriff's Office. We did not receive a
               response and entered the house. Upon searching the interior
               Melcher contacted Smith and Nyberg in the rear bedroom. I could
               hear Smith explain to him that both her and Nyberg had been
               sleeping which was why they hadn't answered the door. Melcher
               asked Smith to come out into the living room where Olmstead and
               I spoke with her. As we spoke with Smith I noticed she did not
               appear to have been awakened from sleep. As we continued to
               speak she admitted to having been arguing with Nyberg in the
               back yard. She told us her uncle had recently passed away and
               she was unable to attend the funeral, which was occurring in a
               few hours in Florida, due to money issues. We continued to
               speak with her for a short period of time before Melcher asked
               her if he could speak with her. I heard a portion of this
               conversation, during which time she told Melcher the same thing
               as she had told Olmstead and I. Around this point Nyberg came
               out of the back bedroom and sat down on a mattress which as
               laying on the floor. Olmstead and I spoke with him at which
               point I noticed an abrasion on the left side of his forehead
               and what appeared to be dried blood on the left leg and pocket
               of his shorts. Nyberg told us he had fallen and hit his head
               which was where the abrasion came from. A short time later
               Melcher placed Smith in custody for assault 4th and transported
               her to the Whitman County Jail for processing. Olmstead and I
               cleared around this point and returned to WSU. Nothing further.
               I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws
               of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 30th day of August, 2014, in Pullman,

               Forwarded DWLS, MIP 2. NARRATIVE: On 08-30-2014 at about 1755
               hrs I was operating stationary radar on State Route (SR) 194
               near milepost 21. I was using the radar unit which is installed
               in vehicle #7. I was participating in a multi-agency, grant
               funded DUI emphasis patrol. I observed a silver, 2009 Subaru
               Forester (WA Lic. APJ7595) travelling eastbound on SR 194, and
               the vehicle appeared to be travelling over the posted speed
               limit of 50 MPH. The radar unit displayed a speed of 57 MPH for
               the vehicle. I stopped the vehicle for the above described
               traffic infraction. As I approached the vehicle, I saw that it
               contained the driver and six other passengers. All of the
               occupants of the vehicle appeared to be college aged, and I saw
               that one male passenger was crammed into the rear cargo area.
               At least two of the rear seat passengers and the male in the
               cargo area were not wearing seat belts. I contacted the driver
               of the vehicle, who was identified as Shane K. Adriano (DOB 10-
               03-1994), and advised him of the reason for the traffic stop. I
               requested that Adriano provide me with his driver's license,
               vehicle registration, and insurance paperwork. Adriano told me
               that he did not have a driver's license and furnished me with a
               paper version of his Washington Identification Card. The female
               front seat passenger told me that the vehicle belonged to her
               and furnished me with valid registration and insurance
               documentation. I could detect the odor of alcohol originating
               from inside the vehicle. I asked Adriano if he had consumed any
               alcohol, and he told me that he had not. Adriano was 19 years
               old. I returned to my patrol vehicle and checked Adriano's
               driving status through Dispatch. Dispatch advised that
               Adriano's Washington driving status was suspended 3rd degree.
               Dispatch also advised that Adriano had an extraditable arrest
               warrant from Kittitas County. I confirmed Adriano's date of
               birth, physicals, and social security number through Dispatch.
               Dispatch advised that the arrest warrant had been confirmed.
               Trooper Murphy and Deputy Langerveld arrived on scene as back-
               up officers. I re-contacted Adriano and told him to step out of
               the vehicle, which he did. At about 1801 hrs I walked Adriano
               back to my patrol vehicle and told him that he was under arrest

               for an arrest warrant and driving with a suspended license 3rd
               degree. I handcuffed Adriano (double-locked), searched his
               person, advised him of his right to an attorney, and placed him
               into my patrol vehicle all without incident. Once Adriano was
               inside my patrol vehicle, I could detect the odor of alcohol
               originating from him. I told Adriano that I could detect the
               odor of alcohol originating from him and asked him again if he
               had consumed any alcohol. Adriano said he had drank some
               alcohol earlier this morning. I asked Adriano if he would
               submit to a voluntary PBT test, and he said no. I spoke with
               Trooper Murphy and Deputy Langerveld and requested that they
               deal with the passengers and the vehicle however they deemed
               appropriate. At about 1818 hrs I cleared the scene and
               transported Adriano to the Whitman County Jail. At about 1834
               hrs I arrived at the jail and read the arrest warrant to
               Adriano. A copy of the arrest warrant was obtained and later
               added to the case file. At about 1851 hrs I advised Adriano of
               his rights, which I read from my Miranda Warning card. Adriano
               said he understood his rights and said "yes", he wished to
               waive his rights and talk with me now. While speaking with
               Adriano, I could detect the odor of alcohol originating from
               him, and I noticed that the odor became stronger whenever he
               opened his mouth to speak. I saw that Adriano's eyes appeared
               to be glassy and watery. I asked Adriano if he would perform
               some field sobriety tests, and he said yes. I directed Adriano
               to the center of the booking room, where I administered the
               field sobriety tests. The floor of the booking room is flat and
               level, and the room is well lighted. Adriano was wearing tennis
               shoes, t-shirt, and shorts. I began the tests at about 1855
               hrs. I gave Adriano the following tests to find out what
               effect, if any, alcohol had on his ability to drive a motor
               vehicle. I explained and demonstrated all tests in detail
               before I asked him to do them. I read the instructions for each
               test from the "Standardized Field Sobriety Testing Instructions
               and Clues" form. I told Adriano not to begin any of the tests
               before I was done explaining the instructions. During the
               tests, Adriano acknowledged that he understood the instructions
               for each test. Adriano said he does not limp and did not have
               any physical defects. Adriano said he pulled a hamstring muscle
               about two months ago. Adriano said he was not under the care of
               a doctor or dentist and had not taken any medication and/or
               drugs in the past 24 hours. Adriano said there was nothing
               mechanically wrong with the vehicle. Adriano said he last
               consumed alcohol sometime around 0300 hrs and 0400 hrs on 08-
               30-2014. #1 Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Test: Adriano was not
               wearing glasses or contact lenses. I checked Adriano's eyes and
               noticed that they tracked equally, and his pupils were of equal
               size. I did not see resting nystagmus in either eye. After
               conducting the tests, I did not detect nystagmus of any type,
               and his eyes tracked smoothly. During the tests, I noticed that
               Adriano's body was swaying in a circular motion. #2 Walk and
               Turn Test: First Nine Steps: Adriano started the test too soon
               and before I had finished the instructions. I told Adriano to
               stop, and I instructed him to return to the ready position.
               Adriano began the test and missed heal to toe between steps one

               and two. Return Nine Steps: No problems. #3 One Leg Stand Test:
               Adriano raised his left foot and began the test. Adriano
               counted by thousands until he reached 11 and 12. At this point,
               he continued to count but stopped counting by thousands, and
               instead counted his numbers normally. The field sobriety tests
               ended at about 1905 hrs, and Adriano accompanied me to the BAC
               room. I checked the DataMaster prior to operating it and found
               it working properly, with the RFI antenna attached, the mouth
               tube warm to the touch, and a temperature within the correct
               range. I checked Adriano's mouth at 1912 hrs. Finding no
               foreign substances or mouth jewelry, I began the 15 minute
               observation period. I read Adriano his Constitutional Rights at
               about 1919 hrs. Adriano said he understood his rights and
               signed both signature blocks. I read Adriano his Implied
               Consent Warning for Breath at about 1931 hrs. I told Adriano
               that he was under arrest for being under 21 years of age and
               driving a motor vehicle after consuming alcohol. Adriano signed
               that it was read to him. I asked Adriano if he would submit to
               a breath test, and he said no. I completed the DUI interview
               questions. Adriano stated that he drank about six cans of beer
               between 2100 hrs or 2200 hrs 08-29-2014 and 0300 hrs or 0400
               hrs on 08-30-2014. Adriano is not a WSU student and was
               visiting friends in Pullman for the weekend. After the required
               15 minute observation period had expired, Adriano stated that
               he did not wish to provide a breath sample. The breath test
               procedure was administered in accordance to the methods
               approved by the Washington State Toxicologist pursuant to the
               Washington Administrative Code. I provided Adriano with the
               Driver's Hearing Request Information Form and his copy of the
               Breath Test Document. I told Adriano that my case would be
               forwarded to the Whitman County Prosecuting Attorney's Office
               for review and possible criminal charges for Driving While
               License Suspended 3rd Degree and Minor Exhibiting Effects of
               Alcohol in Public. Adriano was booked into the jail for the
               arrest warrant. I cleared the scene. I have attended courses in
               the operation of the BAC Verifier DataMaster and the
               Preliminary Breath Test Device. I am certified and qualified as
               an operator by the state toxicologist, and I possess a valid
               operator permit card issued by the state toxicologist. This
               report was forwarded to the Department of Licensing. No further
               action at this time. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,

               4Z0843783 NARRATIVE: On 08/30/14 at approximately 2330 hours I
               was driving westbound on Colorado Street when a male and female
               walking eastbound on Colorado near Vahalla Bar caught my
               attention. The male, later identified as Jordan Cole Trujillo
               11/13/94, was leaning against the female as he walked. Even
               though Trujillo was being helped he was stumbling as he walked
               causing the female to have difficulty controlling Trujillo.
               Both the female and Trujillo appeared to be under the age of 21
               years old. I passed the two and turned around near D St. I
               pulled into the Smith Gym parking lot and waited for the two to
               reach my location. Once they did I asked the two if they had a
               second to talk. Trujillo stopped but still was holding onto the
               female. I told Trujillo that the reason I was stopping to talk
               to him was because he appeared to be very intoxicated. The
               female said, "yeah stumbling." I asked Trujillo if he had his
               ID with him and he said he did not. Trujillo said he did not
               have any ID with him. Trujillo provided his information
               verbally. I asked Trujillo how much he had to drink tonight.
               Trujillo said not that much. I asked Trujillo how much that was
               and Trujillo said he did not know. I asked Trujillo if I could
               check his eyes. Trujillo said I could. During the HGN test I
               observed equal pupil size, equal tracking, lack of smooth
               pursuit, and distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum
               deviation. I could clearly smell the odor of intoxicants coming
               from Trujillo breath as he spoke. I asked Trujillo if he was
               willing to provide a PBT sample and he said no. I told Trujillo
               that he was under arrest for MIP Exhibiting and grabbed his
               right wrist. As soon as I grabbed Trujillo's wrist he tensed up
               his arm in an attempt to overcome my control. Ofc. Boyd grabbed
               Trujillo's left arm and it took both of us placing Trujillo in
               gooseneck holds for Trujillo to comply to our orders. After
               telling Trujillo to relax several times Ofc. Boyd and I were
               able to get Trujillo handcuffed without anymore resistance. I
               searched Trujillo incident to arrest and removed his items from
               his pockets. In his rear pocket was Trujillo's wallet. Ofc.
               Boyd looked at the wallet and found Trujillo's WADL. Ofc. Boyd
               also found an Ohio Driver's license with Trujillo's picture on
               it. However the Ohio license had the name "Jordan C Larson
               11/13/91." I said something to the effect of, when did you live

               in Ohio. Trujillo replied, "oh you mean my fake ID?" I walked
               Trujillo to my patrol car. Trujillo was placed in the backseat
               of my patrol car while I researched his name. The Ohio driver's
               license came back with no record found through Ohio. I told
               Trujillo that he was under arrest for MIP Exhbiting and
               possessing a fictitious or altered ID. Trujillo stated he
               understood. I issued Trujillo Sector citations for MIP
               Exhibiting and possession of a fictitious or altered ID. I
               explained both citations and provided him with his copies.
               Trujillo was released from custody and walked the rest of the
               way home with his female friend. Nothing further. I certify and

               contacted Paul M. Oneill and Nikolas S. Tokuno as they were
               smoking marijuana in their room (407 Stephenson South).
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 08-31-
               14, at approximately 0022 hours, Officer Boyd and I responded
               to Stephenson South for a "Drugs" call. Joshua B. McPhatter
               (06-24-89) was the "On Duty" hall staff member for the
               Stephenson complex. McPhatter called Whitcom stating he smelled
               the odor of marijuana emitting from within 407 Stephenson
               South. Officer Boyd and I responded to the 4th floor of the
               Stephenson complex. Officer Boyd knocked on the door to room
               407. After several moments the door opened. Officer Boyd told
               the occupants; later identified as Paul M. Oniel (09-14-95) and
               Nikolas S. Tokuno (12-16-95) the reason we were there was the
               complaint of the odor of marijuana was coming from their room.
               Oniel initially denied having any marijuana in his room, but
               eventually admitted to having a small amount in the room. He
               handed Officer Boyd a plastic sandwich bag containing what
               appeared to be approximately 2 grams of marijuana. Officer Boyd
               asked Oniel and Tokuno if they would be willing to destroy the
               marijuana. They said they would. They were escorted to the
               ground floor of Stephenson South and were asked to dump the
               marijuana on the ground and smash it into the ground. They did
               so. Officer Boyd advised Tokuno and Oniel they were not allowed
               to possess, smoke, or otherwise consume marijuana while on
               University property. They said they understood and it would not
               happen again. Officer Boyd then explained they would be
               contacted by the Washington State University office of Student
               Standards and Accountability as they violated the Washington
               State University student Code of Conduct. They said they
               understood and were told they were free to go. Hall staff was
               given the Police Case Number and we cleared. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 31st day of August, 2014, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer J.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W3195 SYNOPSIS: Subject arrested for MIP.
               Charges forwarded to the prosecutor and student conduct.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Ryan A. Maitlen/022896
               Arrest/Forward chgs MIP 2. NARRATIVE: On 08/31/14 at about 0208
               hrs I was driving southbound on Library Rd. near Todd Hall when
               I noticed a male who was walking south on Library Rd. with a
               group of people. The male, later identified as Ryan A. Maitlen,
               caught my attention because he was carrying an open can of Four
               Loko. Maitlen appeared to be under the age of 21 and I know
               Four Loko to be an alcoholic beverage. I drove past the group
               Maitlen was walking with and exited my vehicle to contact
               Maitlen. As I rounded the corner of my patrol vehicle I could
               see Maitlen getting up from a squatting position near some
               bushes. He was looking at me and I could see he no longer had
               the Four Loko can in his hand. I told Maitlen he could pick the
               can back up because I already saw him carrying it. He told me
               it was not his and he had just been carrying it for a friend. I
               told him I had seen him carrying it previously and if he was in
               possession of it it was his. I asked Maitlen for his ID and he
               provided me his WA driver's license, which confirmed he was
               under 21. I asked how much he had to drink and he admitted to
               having consumed some alcohol. I asked if I could check his eyes
               and he said yes. I administered a horizontal gaze nystagmus
               test and observed he had bloodshot and watery eyes, a lack of
               smooth pursuit, and a distinct and sustained nystagmus at
               maximum deviation in both eyes. I told Maitlen he was under
               arrest for MIP and directed him to sit on a retaining wall near
               my vehicle. I confirmed through Dispatch he did not have any
               prior contacts and advised Maitlen I would be forwarding
               charges to the Whitman County Prosecutor and student conduct. I
               had Maitlen pour out the remaining Four Loko, dispose of the
               can, and he was released. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
