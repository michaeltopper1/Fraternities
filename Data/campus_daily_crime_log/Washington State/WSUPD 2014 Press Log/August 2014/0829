               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W3149 SYNOPSIS: Report of a vehicle prowl
               which had occurred sometime between 1000 hrs and 1745 hrs on
               082814 in the Lewis Alumni parking lot. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 083014 around 0920 hrs I was
               dispatched to a reported vehicle prowl which had occurred on
               082814 in the Lewis Alumni Center parking lot. I contacted the
               reporting party, later identified as Wenji Dong (071457) and
               was told the following. Dong arrived on campus around 1000 hrs
               on 082814 and could not find a place to park. As a result he
               parked his vehicle in the parking lot of the Lewis Alumni
               Center. He went on to explain he had locked the doors to his
               vehicle (Wa. AJD2939), but had left the windows partially down
               to help keep the interior cool until he returned. When Dong
               returned around 1745 hrs he noticed the door was unlocked and
               items inside were missing, to include his Chinese passport,
               Garmin GPS unit, and flash drive. I asked him if he had any
               idea who may have taken his items and he told me he did not. We
               spoke for a time regarding his missing items and he was told to
               contact the Chinese Embassy to make arrangements to get his
               passport replaced. In addition I gave him my business card
               along with the case number for reference and told him to call
               if he had any questions, which he told me he would. Dong left a
               short time later and I cleared the call. Nothing further at
               this time. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 29th day of August, 2014, in Pullman,

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W3153 SYNOPSIS: Report of a galvanized
               piece of steel tubing which had been stolen from EE/ME around
               0630 hrs. The suspect was described as a college age male
               between 5-06 and 5-08. The suspect vehicle was described as
               driving a 80's-90's GMC 3/4 to pickup with a canopy and WSU
               plates. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 082914 around 0955 hrs I was dispatched to a reported theft
               of construction material from the loading dock area of the
               Electical Engineering/ Mechanical Engineering Building (EE/ME).
               I contacted the reporting party, later identified as Ryan J
               Turner (081888), and was told the following. Turner explained
               that he works for a company called Cobra out of Spokane Wa. He
               went on to say his crew had come to Pullman and were supposed
               to install an 8 foot galvanized square metal pipe at EE/ME, but
               learned from a custodian that it had been taken around 0630 hrs
               by an individual. I asked Turner if he had a description of the
               individual who took the pipe and was told he was college age,
               between 5-06 and 5-08. He was driving a 1980's-early 1990's GMC
               3/4 ton full size pick-up with an extended cab and canopy. He
               went on to tell me the pick-up was burgundy in color with WSU
               plates. I asked him what the pipe was used for and he explained
               it was a specialty item which was going to attached to EE/ME
               and have communication and satellite equipment installed on it.
               He went on to describe the tube as having a plate and supports
               welded onto one end. I asked him how much the pipe would have
               weighed and he told me somewhere in the area of 200 lbs and
               having a cost of about $2000.00. I provided Turner with my
               business card and case number for reference and told him I
               would see what I could do about locating the pipe. He told me
               it was most likely already on the way to a scrap yard and I
               told him I would check and let him know. After Turner cleared I
               contacted Pacific Steel and Recycling in Lewiston Id and found
               they were closed for inventory, but told me they would keep an
               eye out for the pipe and vehicle if it showed up. I thanked
               them and concluded my call. I later contacted Sutton Salvage,
               also in Lewiston Id and explained what I was looking for and
               the vehicle involved. They had not seen the vehicle or the pipe
               come into their shop, but also told me they would contact me if
               it showed up. I thanked them and after speaking with them
               attempted to contact Tom Parrish at Facilities Operations to
               find out who the custodian who had witnessed the theft was and
               speak with them. Parrish was not available and I left a message
               for him to contact me. At this point I contacted Whitcom and

               male involved with the description I had been given by Turner.
               In addition I provided a description of the pipe and welded end
               in the event it was located. Investigation continues. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W3157 08/29/14 SYNOPSIS: Wildland fire in
               a field on SE Dairy Road across from the Anthropology Storage
               building. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE:
               On August 29, 2014 at about 1047 hours Pullman Fire, Whitman
               County Fire District 12 and WSU Police were dispatched to a
               wildland fire on SE Dairy Road. I responded to the area from
               Olympia Avenue. I could not see any smoke in the area as I
               responded. I was the first emergency responder to arrive on
               scene. The fenced field had standing grass in it. The grass was
               about 12 to 18 inches in height. There were no animals in the
               field. The field was actively burning around a power pole. The
               power pole was later measured to be approximately nine (9) feet
               away from the fence. The fence was only a couple of feet away
               from the road. I could feel the wind blowing from the east
               towards the west. The wind pushed the fire up a steep hill.
               There was no entry into the field from the Dairy Road side.
               Personnel from the compost facility used a front loader to
               break open the fencing. This opening allowed firefighters to
               easily access and attack the fire. Whitman County Fire District
               12 personnel used a brush truck to extinguish the majority of
               the fire. The fire was not easily accessible by the large
               structural trucks used by Pullman Fire. The fire burned
               approximately one (1) to two (2) acres of field grass. I spoke
               with a witness who first discovered the fire, George W. Martin
               (11/13/50). Martin works for WSU Housing Maintenance. He was
               driving north on Dairy Rd when he noticed a small fire burning
               around the power pole. Martin radioed his WSU Housing
               Maintenance dispatch and they called 911. Martin told me the
               fire was burning only a foot or two around the power pole. I
               asked him if there was any sparking. He said there was no
               sparking. Martin went to his WSU Housing vehicle and retrieved
               his 2.5 pound dry chemical fire extinguisher. Martin tried to
               extinguish the fire but he was too far away due to the fence.
               There were several people in the area when I arrived on scene.
               Many of them were workers from the nearby buildings who
               temporarily evacuated. Some of them were customers at the
               nearby Surplus Sales. There were a lot of cars in the Surplus
               parking lot for their Friday sale. Once the fire was
               extinguished WSU Facilities Operations high voltage
               electricians and AVISTA personnel inspected the power pole as
               well as the underground natural gas line. The pole had some
               charring on the west side of it. The blackened area was about
               four feet in height. WSU electricians said they will not

               replace the pole. All of the electricians said there was
               nothing wrong with the pole or the electrical system. The
               cutouts were still in tact and they could visually see nothing
               wrong with the wiring, hardware or pole The pole had a conduit
               running down the east side. I was told that conduit fed a
               nearby transformer. Neither WSU or AVISTA experienced any type
               of power outage or power problem at the time of the fire. The
               weather conditions on August 28, 2014 at 1053 hours according
               to the National Weather Service Pullman Moscow Regional Airport
               Reporting station were: Temperature: 76 Degrees Fahrenheit Dew
               Point: 39 Degrees Fahrenheit Relative Humidity: 26% Wind
               Direction: WSW Wing Speed: 7 MPH There were no reported
               lightening strikes or precipitation. WSU Fire Inspector
               Bennett, Pullman Firefighter Nuttman and I investigated the
               origin and cause. There were no security or video cameras in
               the area. Although there were several people watching the fire
               nobody had any information on how or why the fire started. I
               spoke with Fred Loaiza, Animal Care Facility Manager about the
               field. He said all the animals were moved out of the field last
               week or earlier this week. Loaiza said there was no electric
               fence. Loaiza estimated damage to the fence was about $300.00.
               We searched the area around the power pole as that is where the
               witness first saw the fire. We found nothing that would
               indicated how the fire started. Next to the pole we located
               small rodent skulls. They looked like they had been there for
               some time and may have been the leftovers from a bird's meal.
               There was no evidence of discarded smoking materials, matches,
               or incendiary devices. It is unknown what caused the fire. The
               cause of the fire shall be classified as undetermined. No
               further investigation at this time. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 29th day of
               August, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               approximately 1737 hours, I was dispatched to a disabled
               vehicle in the eastbound lane of Stadium Way near Nevada St.
               Upon arrival I found the Jeep as described. I contacted the
               driver, Reile Dean Vanderpool 12/24/91, who said her car died
               and it would not start. I attempted to start the Jeep and it
               seemed it had a dead battery. I enlisted the help of two
               passerby's and we were able to push the Jeep onto Nevada Street
               out of the way. Ofc. Jones responded to the area with the
               jumper pack. We were able to start the Jeep but it kept dying.
               Vanderpool called AAA and they told her they would have a tow
               truck to them in the next 3 hours. I spoke with a Parking
               Services employee and explained the situation with the Jeep.
               Vanderpool said she was going to walk home and return when AAA
               called. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 29th day of August,

               11/28/95 Charges Forwarded MIP Exhibiting 2. NARRATIVE: On
               08/30/14 at approximately 0032 hours I was driving southbound
               on Library Road when I noticed a group of 4 individuals. One
               male, later identified as Taylor R. Zillyett 11/28/95, grabbed
               my attention more than the others. Zillyett was having
               difficulty walking under his own power. A second male Jason G
               Chatelin 07/23/93 had his arm across Zillyett's back and
               holding him up by his ribs. Even with the help of Chatelin,
               Zillyett was stumbling as he walked. Zillyett appeared to be
               under the age of 21. I contacted the group asked them if I
               could talk to them. The group kept walking so I said Stop
               Police. All 4 individuals stopped. I asked the group where they
               were walking to and they said Olympia Hall. I told Zillyett
               that I was stopping to talk to him specifically. I asked
               Zillyett a series of questions to determine Zillyett's mental
               status. Zillyett answer all my questions correctly. I asked
               Zillyett if he had his ID with him and he provided me with WSU
               Cougar Card. Zillyett provided his date of birth verbally and
               identified himself as 18 years old. About this time Sgt. Macy
               arrived on scene. I asked Zillyett how much he had to drink
               tonight. Zillyett said "not that much." I asked how much not
               that much was to him. Zillyett said he had one or two beers. I
               asked Zillyett if I could check his eyes. Zillyett said I
               could. During the HGN test I observed equal tracking, equal
               pupil size, lack of smooth pursuit, and distinct and sustained
               nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes. I had to remind
               Zillyett not to move his test during the test. As I was
               performing the test Zillyett was swaying side to side. I could
               clearly smell the odor of intoxicants coming from Zillyett's
               breath as he stood before me. It was clear that Zillyett had
               consumed a large amount of alcohol. I asked Zillyett if he was
               willing to provide a PBT sample and he said no. I told Zillyett
               that he was under arrest for MIP Exhibiting and handcuffed
               (D/L) him. I advised Zillyett of his right to counsel. Zillyett
               was searched incident to arrest and no weapons or illegal items
               were found. I placed Zillyett in the backseat of my patrol car
               as I researched Zillyett's contacts. Dispatch stated that
               Zillyett's arrest history was clear. Sgt. Macy contacted
               Chatelin who said he was sober and willing to watch over
               Zillyett for the night. I told Zillyett that I would be

               driving northbound on Thatuna Rd. when I noticed a vehicle that
               was driving northbound in front of me. The vehicle, WA AAJ0506,
               caught my attention because it was driving in the right hand
               lane and then made a sudden left turn on to Linden St. To make
               the turn the vehicle crossed over the left lane of travel. I
               turned in behind the vehicle and initiated a traffic stop,
               turning on my overhead lights. The vehicle stopped on Linden
               St. near Duncan Dunn Hall. I contacted the driver, Don H. Hume
               (071996), and told him the reason for the stop and the stop was
               being recorded. I asked for Hume's driver's license, vehicle
               registration, and proof of insurance. Hume provided me with his
               driver's license but could not provide any of the other
               information. As I was speaking wit Hume I noticed a full can of
               beer in the pocket on the back of the front passenger seat.
               Hume's driver's license showed he was under the age of 21. I
               asked Hume to exit the vehicle and he did so. I asked him about
               the alcohol in the car and he said he did not have any alcohol
               in the car. I asked about the beer in the back of the passenger
               seat and he said he did not know who put it there. I spoke to
               Hume's passenger, Robert J. Larue (071495), who admitted to
               having consumed several beer's earlier in the night. Larue did
               not know anything about the beer in the back of his seat. I
               asked Hume to retrieve the beer for me, which he did. The beer
               was warm to the touch and appeared to have been in the car for
               quite a while. I directed Hume to pour the beer out and dispose
               of the can. I told him I would be forwarding charges to the
               Whitman County Prosecutor for MIP and Student Conduct. Hume was
               released. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty

               08/30/14 at approximately 0050 hours, I was driving northbound
               on Spokane Street near Columbia Street when I noticed a male,
               later identified as Evan Anderson 11/11/95, walking southbound
               in the roadway. For some reason Anderson decided to walk in the
               roadway even though a side walk was provided for him. As I
               neared Anderson, Anderson tied to hide his face from me by
               turning away. Even with Anderson's attempt to turn away, I
               noticed that Anderson appeared to be under the age of 21. I
               passed Anderson and turned around about a block away from him.
               I watched as Anderson was walking in the roadway heading
               southbound. Anderson was stumbling side to side as he walked. I
               pulled along side of Anderson and asked him if he had a second
               to talk. Anderson stopped. I asked Anderson why he was walking
               in the roadway when there was a sidewalk provided. Anderson
               said, "I'm just right here." I noticed a bulge in the waist
               line of Anderson's shirt. I asked Anderson about it and he
               lifted his shirt up. Anderson's cargo shorts were unzipped and
               unbuttoned. The only thing keeping his shorts on was his belt
               was fastened. I asked Anderson why his pants were undone.
               Anderson replied, "I don't know." I asked Anderson why he did
               not remember how his pants came undone. Anderson replied, "I
               just messed up." Anderson was not making a lot of sense. I
               asked Anderson if he had his ID with him and he provided me
               with his WADL. I asked Anderson how old he was and Anderson
               said he was 17 years old. I asked Anderson how much he had to
               drink tonight. Anderson said, "not much at all." I asked how
               much that was for him. Anderson said, "I had a beer." I asked
               Anderson if I could check his eyes. Anderson said I could.
               During the HGN test I observed equal tracking equal pupil size,
               lack of smooth pursuit, and distinct and sustained nystagmus at

               Boyd and Intern Hochanadel arrived on scene. I asked Anderson
               if he was willing to provide a PBT sample. Anderson said he
               would. Anderson provided a PBT sample of .189. I told Anderson
               that he was under arrest for MIP Exhibiting and he was
               handcuffed (D/L). At my direction Anderson was searched by
               Intern Hochanadel. During the search Intern Hochanadel located

               a small circular clear container with a waxy substance in it. I
               opened the container and it smelled strongly of marijuana. I
               believe the substance to be hash oil. I read Anderson his
               Miranda Rights off my preprinted card. Anderson said he
               understood his rights and having them in mind, he did not want
               to speak with me. I told Anderson that if the substance tested
               positive for marijuana I would also be charging him with
               possession of marijuana. I asked Anderson if we could call his
               mother off his cell phone. Anderson said I could. I called
               Anderson's mother, Kari L. Anderson 12/17/62 who answered. I
               explained the situation to Kari and Kari said she understood.
               Kari stated she was confused about the juvenile part because
               Anderson was 18 years old. While still on the phone with Kari I
               asked Anderson how old he was. Anderson said 17. Kari said he
               is 18 years old. Ofc. Boyd checked the driver's license that
               Anderson provided which did identify him as 18 years old. I
               apologized to Kari for waking her up and ended our
               conversation. I gave Anderson a ride to his dorm and walked him
               to his room. Once at Anderson's room I released him from
               custody. I explained to Anderson what charges were being sent
               to the prosecutor and he said he understood. Anderson went into
               his room and I cleared. Once back at the station the waxy
               substance NIC tested presumptive positive for marijuana. The
               marijuana was logged into evidence. Charges of MIP Exhibiting
               and Possession of Marijuana less than 40 grams will be
               forwarded to the prosecutor. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               #4Z0238639 2. NARRATIVE: On 08/30/14 at about 0124 hrs I was
               driving northbound on Stadium Way from Wilson Rd. when I
               noticed a vehicle that was driving southbound on Stadium Way
               from the area of Colorado St. the vehicle, WA 915LSS, caught my
               attention because it appeared to be traveling faster than the
               posted 20 MPH speed limit. I activated my police traffic radar
               unit (Vh38) which emitted a high pitched audio doppler tone
               that was steady in pitch. I observed a display on the radar
               unit of 31 MPH. The speed readings were consistent with my
               visual estimate of the vehicle's speed. The suspect vehicle was
               the only moving vehicle in the radar field at the time of the
               speed readings. The calibration of the radar unit was checked
               both before and after the stop by the use of factory certified
               tuning forks. The radar unit was found to be in proper working
               order. I turned around and initiated a traffic stop on the
               vehicle, turning on my overhead lights. The vehicle drove
               slowly for a while before turning as if it was going to turn up
               Wilson Rd. The vehicle stopped parked parallel with Stadium
               Way. The rear of the vehicle was in the eastbound lane of
               Wilson Rd. and the front of the vehicle was on the sidewalk at
               the southwest corner of Wilson Rd. and Stadium Way. I contacted
               the driver, Jami M. Kouba, and told her the reason for the stop
               and the stop was being recorded. As I spoke to Kouba I could
               smell the odor of intoxicants coming from the vehicle. Kouba's
               left dress strap had fallen off and the top of her dress on the
               left side was hanging down near her waste, leaving the left
               side of her bra exposed. I asked for Kouba's driver's license,
               vehicle registration, and proof of insurance. As she began
               looking for the information she fixed her dress. I noticed
               Kouba had a blank stare on her face and her movements appeared
               to be very deliberate as she gathered the requested
               information. I asked Kouba how much she had to drink and she
               denied having consumed alcohol. I asked if I could check her
               eyes to make sure and she agreed. I administered a horizontal
               gaze nystagmus test on her while she was seated in the vehicle.
               I observed she had bloodshot and watery eyes and a lack of
               smooth pursuit. I asked Kouba to exit the vehicle and she did
               so. I asked Kouba again how much alcohol she had to drink and
               she denied having consumed alcohol. I asked Kouba if she would
               be willing to perform some voluntary field sobriety tests so I

               could make sure she was not impaired and she initially agreed.
               I explained to her I would be evaluating her based on how well
               she followed my instructions as well as how she performed on
               the tests. The first test I administered was the horizontal
               gaze nystagmus test. I told Kouba to stand with her feet
               together and her arms at her sides. I confirmed her eyes
               tracked equally and her pupils were of equal size. I observed
               Kouba had bloodshot and watery eyes, a lack of smooth pursuit,
               a distinct and sustained nystagmus, an immediate onset of
               nystagmus, and a vertical nystagmus in both eyes. I began to
               explain the second test when Kouba asked why she was doing
               this. I told her I did not believe she was being honest with me
               and that she had been drinking alcohol. I told her I was trying
               to determine if she was impaired by the alcohol. Kouba said she
               did not want to do any more tests. I asked if she was going to
               be honest with me about how much she had to drink. She thought
               for a moment, took a deep breath, and said "No, I have not had
               anything to drink". At that time it was my opinion that Kouba's
               ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. I
               advised Kouba she was under arrest for DUI and placed her in
               handcuffs (double locked). I had WSU Police Intern Hochanadel
               search Kouba incident to arrest. Kouba asked that I retrieve
               her bag and phone from the vehicle so I did so. I transported
               Kouba to Pullman PD for the breath test. Upon arrival at PPD I
               confirmed the Datamaster instrument was in proper working
               order, with the breath tube warm to the touch, the RFI antenna
               attached, and the temperature display showing 34.00 degrees. I
               read Kouba her constitutional rights from the DUI packet and
               she signed stating so. I asked if she was going to want to
               speak with an attorney and she said yes. I contacted the on
               call public defender for her and allowed Koubal to speak with
               him until I noticed her hang up the phone. I checked Kouba's
               mouth at 0147 hrs and found no foreign substances. I asked
               Kouba if she was willing to waive her rights to answer my
               questions. I explained to her she could change her mind at any
               time and choose to not answer any questions or make any
               statements. Kouba signed the DUI packet waiving her rights at
               0148 hrs. I read Kouba her implied consent warning for breath
               at 0151 hrs and she signed stating so. I asked if she would
               submit to a breath test and she said yes. I checked the yes box
               on the DUI packet and asked her to initial next to it. Kouba
               checked the yes box next to the question about expressing
               confusion regarding the implied consent warnings. I asked if
               she was confused by the implied consent warnings and she said
               no but looked confused by the question. I explained to her that
               I asked her to initial next to the yes box indicating she would
               submit to the breath test but she checked the box expressing
               confusion regarding the implied consent warnings. I confirmed
               she was not actually confused by the implied consent warnings
               and checked the no box on the DUI packet. I had her initial
               next to both the yes box indicating she would submit to a
               breath test and the no box indicating she was not confused by
               the implied consent warnings. I asked Kouba the questions from
               the DUI packet. She thought it was 0125 hrs at 0155 hrs. Kouba
               denied consuming alcohol. Kouba provided a breath sample of

               .233 at 0208 hrs and a second sample of .225 at 0210 hrs. The
               breath test was administered in accordance to the methods
               approved by the Washington State toxicologist pursuant to the
               Washington Administrative Code. I had Kouba sit in a holding
               cell while I completed paperwork. I later returned and provided
               Kouba with a copy of the following documents: breath test
               document, driver's hearing request form, notice of
               hearing/conditions of release form, and vehicle tow impound
               form. I issued Kouba criminal citation #4Z0238639 for DUI. I
               explained the citation to her, she received her copy, and was
               released. I provided Kouba with a courtesy transport to her
               residence on Harvey Rd. Nothing further. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of

               NARRATIVE: On 08/30/14 at approximately 0210 hours, I was
               driving eastbound on East Main approaching Spring Street when I
               noticed two cars heading westbound towards me. One car, a 2014
               blue Ford Forte was going noticeably faster than the car next
               to him. The Ford appeared to be traveling faster than the
               posted 25 MPH zone. I activated my in car radar (vehicle 4) and
               obtained a reading of 38 MPH for the Ford and 28 MPH for the
               second car. Once the Ford passed me, I turned around and caught
               up to the car near Subway. I activated my emergency lights and
               the Ford came to a stop at East Main and Kamiaken St. I
               contacted the driver, Ralph Lenard Williams 07/20/95,
               identified myself, informed Williams I was recording, and
               explained the reason for the stop. I asked Williams if he had
               his driver's license with him. Williams said he did not. I
               asked Williams if he has a driver's license and he said he did.
               I asked Williams if he had any other forms of identification
               with him and he said he did not. I asked for the vehicle
               registration and proof of insurance. Williams said the car was
               his friends car that he was borrowing and provided me with the
               registration. I asked Williams what his last name was. Williams
               said it was "WILLIAMS." I asked Williams what his first name
               was and Williams spelled it, "LENARD." Williams said his middle
               initial was "L" and his date of birth was 07/20/95. Williams
               said he has a Washington Driver's License. I asked Williams for
               the last four digits of his social security number. Williams
               said he did not know. I asked Williams what the address was on
               his driver's license was. Williams said it was 610 Thomas Court
               SE in Auburn, WA. I returned to my patrol car and ran Williams
               through dispatch. Dispatch stated there was no return for
               Williams through Washington. I returned to Williams and asked
               him to confirm his information. Williams provided the exact
               same information. I asked Williams why I would not find a
               return for the name he provided. Williams said he did not know.
               Through my interaction with Williams, I had the feeling that
               Williams was not being truthful with me. I asked Williams to
               step out of his car which he did. I told Williams that he was
               being detained until I could confirm his identity. Williams was
               handcuffed (D/L) walked to my patrol car. I asked Williams if I

               could search him for weapons and he said I could. No weapons
               were found during the search. I placed Williams in the backseat
               of my patrol car. I told Williams that the information he
               provided to me has never been associated with any Washington
               Driver. Williams said that was his information. For a third
               time I asked Williams to tell me his name and date of birth. I
               spelled the name Williams had provided me and Williams said it
               was correct. I started to research Williams on my in car
               computer and Williams said, "so I'm going to spend the night in
               jail." I told Williams that I could not say because I had not
               figured out his real name yet. I asked Williams what was
               printed on his birth certificate. Williams said, "Ralph Lenard
               Williams the 3rd." I ran Ralph L Williams 07/20/95 through my
               MDC and obtained Williams true driver's return. Williams had an
               expired instructional permit that expired on 03/13/14. Williams
               is not a licensed driver. I looked up Williams driver's license
               photo and it matched Williams. I also located a misdemeanor
               warrant for Williams out of King County, WA. Dispatch called on
               the warrant and stated that it was King County extradition
               only. I told Williams that he was under arrest for NVOL without
               ID and making false of misleading statements to a public
               servant. I told Williams that we would legally park his car for
               him so it would not be towed. Williams said that was fine. Sgt.
               Macy moved the car. Just prior to me taking Williams to the
               Pullman Holding Facility, Williams asked what would have
               happened if he had given me ID. I told Williams that he would
               have received a speeding ticket and another traffic ticket for
               driving without a license. Williams asked if he would have been
               arrested and I said no. Williams informed me that he had hid
               his wallet in the car so I could not figure out who he was. I
               asked Williams if he wanted me to get his wallet and he said
               yes. Williams said his wallet was behind the passenger seat
               inside a pocket on the seat. I found the wallet Williams had
               described. Inside the wallet I found Williams' expired
               Washington Instructional Permit. I told Williams that he was
               still being charged with NVOL without ID because he had ample
               time to provide me with his license as I had asked. Williams
               was transported to the Pullman Holding Facility where he was
               fingerprinted and photographed. I issued Williams Sector
               citations for, NVOL without ID, making false or misleading
               statements to a public servant, and a speeding NOI. I explained
               each citation to Williams and provided him with his copies.
               Williams was released from custody shorty thereafter. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 30th day of August, 2014, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W3180 SYNOPSIS: Subject was found
               unconscious by boyfriend in her dorm room. She was taken into
               protective custody after waking in the ambulance and becoming
               uncooperative. While in route she made comments about her
               boyfriend assaulting her. It was later determined she was
               referencing a previously reported incident and there was no
               reason to believe a new assault occurred. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Tofaagaoalii A. Laa/083091 Detox 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 08/30/14 at about 0238 hrs Dispatch advised of an
               unconscious female in room 4 of McEachern Hall. I responded and
               found a male, Fiaai R. Moliga, who told me his girlfriend,
               Tofaagaoalii Laa, had been drinking heavily and was passed out
               on the floor. I checked on Laa and confirmed she was breathing
               but she was unresponsive. Pullman ambulance personnel arrived
               on scene and determined Laa needed to be transported to the
               hospital. I cleared the scene and a short time later the
               ambulance personnel advised Laa woke up and was being verbally
               resistive in the ambulance. I responded and tried to talk with
               Laa to explain why she needed to go to the hospital. Laa still
               was refusing to go to the hospital. I told Laa she was in
               protective custody and was going to go to the hospital
               regardless. I rode in the ambulance to the hospital to make
               sure Laa did not become resistive again. On the way to the
               hospital Laa made several references to her boyfriend beating
               her up. She was highly intoxicated so it was difficult to
               understand if she was talking about a recent event or a past
               event. She made several comments about lying to her attorneys
               to "get him off" the last time he beat her up. Once at the
               hospital Laa continued to be uncooperative with hospital staff,
               refusing to speak with them or let them do anything unless her
               boyfriend or I were in the room. At that time hospital staff
               and I were not going to let her boyfriend in the room until we
               determined if a physical altercation occurred between them. I
               was able to speak with Laa and she told me she remembered
               drinking at her boyfriends room with some friends. She and her
               boyfriend later returned to her room and had an argument. She
               could not remember anything else until being in the ambulance.
               She was unable to say if there was a physical altercation
               between them or not. She told me he had "beat her up"
               previously and been arrested. At that time she lied to the
               attorney's to "get him off" because she loves him. Ambulance
               personnel did not find any signs of injury or an assault on
               Laa. She had a mark on her neck which she said was a hickey

               from the previous night. This leads me to believe Laa was not
               assaulted that night and the references she was making to being
               beat up were from the prior incident which was already reported
               to police. I spoke with Moliga and he could remember drinking
               at his room and then returning to Laa's room. He did not
               remember having an argument with her and said there was no
               physical fight. He was also quite intoxicated. Moliga was
               allowed back to see Laa and she was cooperative from that point
               on so I cleared. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 30 day of

               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On August 30, 2014 at about 0640
               hours I was dispatched to Dana Hall for a broken glass panel in
               an entry door. I responded to the building where I contacted a
               WSU Facilities Operations Maintenance worker. He discovered the
               damage to the door this morning. The building was locked up at
               2300 hours last night. The door that was damaged is on Spokane
               Street. It is on the southeast corner of the building. There
               are three doors at this entrance. The center door was damaged.
               It appears that someone kicked the glass panel breaking it. The
               panel shattered but stayed in place as it is safety glass. The
               panel measures 17 inches by 60 3/4 inches. The estimated value
               of the glass is $250.00. Digital photos of the damage were
               taken. There are no suspects, witnesses, or leads at this time.
               No further investigation. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 30th day of August,
