               hours I was dispatched to the WSU Police Department lobby for a
               two vehicle non injury collision. I contacted the
               complainant/driver #1, Ciesielski, Timothy J. (04/22/52).
               Ciesielski told me the accident happened yesterday, August 21,
               2014 at about 1415 hours. He went on to say that he was backing
               up out of the Motorpool shop area and struck a parked stepvan.
               The stepvan was parked in the driveway area inside the fenced
               area at Motorpool. Ciesielski said he did not see the stepvan
               as he was backing up. He was driving a flatbed truck. His
               vehicle did not sustain any damage. Ciesielski said WSU Motor
               Pool personnel were aware of the collision. Ciesielski came to
               the police department to get a case number as part of the
               WSU/State of Washington vehicle accident reporting process. He
               provided me a copy of his accident report. This has been
               scanned into the case file. I provided Ciesielski the case
               number. I went out to WSU Motor Pool and spoke with Brad Hill.
               He was aware of the incident. He told me that Ciesielski was
               backing up and struck the parked stepvan. I gave Hill a copy of
               Ciesielski's accident report. I did not take any photos because
               I was not able to view the vehicles. There were no reported
               injuries. No infractions or citations were issued. No further
               investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury

               that he left the backpack in the laundry room and returned this
               morning at 0800 hours to look for it. He checked the laundry
               room as well as the Stephenson front desk. Milliren came to the

               to the station. I emailed Megan and asked her to come by and
               identify the phone before 5:00 PM this evening when we closed.
               Failing that, I told her ot use the call box to call Whitcom

               approximately 1649 hours, I was dispatched to a non-injury
               collision at Stadium Way and Nevada St. The vehicles had
               already moved out of the street and into a parking lot near the
               Washington Building. I spoke with Judy R. Davis and asked what
               happened. Davis said she was heading westbound on Stadium Way
               and was stopped for the red light. Davis said she was then rear
               ended by Roopesh M. Syamaladevi when she was at the light. I
               asked Syamaladevi what happened. Syamaladevi said he was behind
               Davis when Davis let off her break to start driving.
               Syamaladevi said Davis then came to a stop and he could not
               stop in time and rear ended her. Both Davis and Syamaladevi
               said they were wearing their seatbelts and did not need medical
               attention. Davis had damage to the middle section of her
               bumper. There were several paint transfer marks and one crack
               about 4 inches long. The estimated value of damage is $300
               dollars. The damage to Syamaladevi's car was contained to his
               license plate only. Syamaladevi's license plate was bent up
               during he collision but the vehicle itself had no damage. It is
               approximately $30 dollars for a license plate to be reissued. I
               created an exchange of information sheet for Davis and
               Syamaladevi using Sector. I explained the sheet and both stated
               they understood. Photos of the damage to both cars were taken
               and later uploaded to the department's computer. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of

               they believed to be a gunshot. At the time of the report I
               could see large mortar type fireworks going off in the area of
               Mcgee way. Officer Westerman was on a traffic stop on Merman
               Dr. at the time and advised the sound the original complainant
               called about was the same as the sound from the fireworks I
               could see at the time the call was dispatched. I checked the
               area around Steptoe Village and found no signs of an emergency.
               The sound was most likely from the fireworks being discharged.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-w3012 SYNOPSIS: I contacted Lane S.
               Lozier 03-23-1993 for climbing in a tree near the Merman Dr
               entrance to the Valley Rd playfield. He was released and told I
               would be contacting grounds to determine if there was damage or
               not to the tree. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.Lane S
               Lozier Warned Malicious Mischief 2. NARRATIVE: On 08-22-14 at
               about 2343 hours I was on patrol driving on Merman Dr towards
               Valley road when I saw a group of people running from the
               bushes near the playfields. I went down to Valley Rd and turned
               around and head back up Merman Dr. As I passed the entrance to
               the playfield I saw an unidentified male either taking a
               picture or video of a tree with a hand held electronic device
               and others were standing around him. I turned around in the
               Kamiak Village parking lot and saw the male still videoing the
               tree and others looking up into the tree as if something was
               going on in the tree. As I pulled into the parking lot with my
               drivers window rolled down, I heard someone from the ground
               yell "the police are here". As he did that I looked into the
               tree and saw a person in a white shirt climbing down from the
               interior of the tree. As the male, later identified by a
               Washington drivers license as Lane S Lozier 03-23-1993, was
               climbing down I could hear the sound of limbs breaking. As the
               male climbed from the tree I told him to place his hands on my
               car. He was patted down and no weapons were found. I asked for
               his ID and he provided his WA drivers license. I told him why I
               was contacting him. As I talked to him I smelled the strong
               odor of intoxicants coming from his breath and he admitted to
               having been drinking at the ZZU. Lozier didn't think breaking
               the limbs was that big of a deal saying "the limbs will fall
               off anyway in the fall". I then pointed out to Lozier he was
               climbing and evergreen and their needles don't fall off and
               that it is the leafs that fall off the trees in the falls and
               not the limbs. Lozier didn't seem to understand that due to his
               level of intoxication. I told Lozier I would have grounds
               evaluate the tree for damage and if damage was found he could
               be charged with malicious mischief. He was advised to go to his
               friends house for the night since he is just visiting and to
               stay there. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this _23rd___ day of

               Exhibiting 2. NARRATIVE: On 08/23/14 at approximately 2356
               hours I was driving eastbound on Colorado Street near the
               Soccer Fields when I noticed three people walking eastbound on
               Colorado. The three caught my attention due to two males on
               either side of a female trying to get the female to walk. The
               males had the female's arms over their shoulders and the female
               was dragging her feet as the males walked forward. Believing
               that the female may be passed out or having a medical condition
               I stopped to talk to the three. I pulled over and turned on my
               emergency lights since I was facing the wrong way in the
               westbound lane of Colorado. I told the three I needed to talk
               to them and they stopped. One male, only known as "Marcus", was
               holding the female, Teryn E. Nicolet 10/04/96 up. I asked
               Marcus if he knew Nicolet and he said he known Nicolet from
               High School. I asked Nicolet if she knew where she was. Nicolet
               said she was heading towards Stephenson South, even though she
               was walking the wrong way. I asked Nicolet several questions to
               determine her mental status. Nicolet answered all the questions
               correctly but her words were heavily slurred. I asked Nicolet
               if she was able to stand on her own and Marcus let go of
               Nicolet. Nicolet began to fall backwards and Marcus caught her.
               It was clear that Nicolet was intoxicated to the level that she
               was unable to stand unsupported. Nicolet appeared to be under
               the age of 21. I asked Nicolet if she had her ID with her.
               Nicolet almost fell into me while she was looking for her ID.
               Nicolet provided me with her WSU ID card. Nicolet provided her
               date of birth verbally as 10/04/96 which made her 17 years old.
               I asked Nicolet how much she had to drink tonight. Nicolet said
               she could not remember. I asked Nicolet if she was willing to
               provide a PBT sample. Nicolet said she would. I found my PBT,
               Alco-Sensor FST (#16805) in working condition. Nicolet provided
               a PBT sample of .236. I could clearly smell the overpowering
               odor of intoxicants coming from Nicolet's breath. I told
               Nicolet that she was under arrest for MIP Exhibiting. I placed
               Nicolet's hands behind her back and Nicolet decided to let
               herself fall forwarded. I told Nicolet to stand up and Intern
               Sorensen and I had to lift Nicolet up. I had Nicolet lean
               against my patrol car as I handcuffed her. I attempted to place
               Nicolet in the backseat of my patrol car but again she decided

               to flop her body down onto the pavement. I asked for medics to
               respond to our location since Nicolet could not walk. After
               coaching Nicolet I was able to get her to stand back up and sit
               down in my patrol car. Once medics arrived they evaluated
               Nicolet but they did not want to transport her to PRH. I was
               unable to find any contact information for Nicolet's parents
               using Zzusis. I asked Nicolet if she would unlock her cell
               phone so I could call her mother but she refused to do so.
               Nicolet was released from custody for the MIP and placed
               Nicolet into protective custody. I transported Nicolet to PRH
               where she was admitted for an alcohol detox. Once Nicolet was
               transferred into the care of the Hospital staff I cleared. Once
               back at the station I researched using zzusis, spillman, daps,
               and linxnw for a phone number for Nicolet's mother, Stacy Lynn
               Nicolet 01/30/71. I was unable to locate any phone numbers. I
               had Port Orchard Police Department respond to 7276 E Manchester
               Ct, Port Orchard, WA, 98366 to try and contact Stacy. POPD was
               unable to get ahold of anybody at that address. On 08/23/14 at
               approximately 1800 hours I went to Nicolet's dorm room
               Stephenson South room 515. I knocked on the door and Nicolet
               answered. I asked Nicolet if we could talk and she invited me
               in. I asked Nicolet if she remembered meeting me last night.
               Nicolet said no. I asked Nicolet what she remembered from last
               night. Nicolet said she went to a "gathering" and was drinking.
               Nicolet said the next thing she remembered was waking up at the
               hospital. I filled Nicolet in about our contact last night. I
               also reminded Nicolet that I was forwarding charges of MIP
               Exhibiting to Juvenile Services. I asked Nicolet what the
               hospital said her BAC was. Nicolet said the doctors said she
               was a .300. I asked Nicolet for her mother's cell phone number
               since I still needed to contact her. Nicolet provided Stacy's
               phone number. I told Nicolet that she was also being referred
               to student conduct and she said she understood. I also provided
               Nicolet with my business card and her case number. Once back at
               the station, I called Stacy and left a voicemail. At 1825 hours
               Stacy returned my call. I explained the incident last night and
               what charges were being forwarded. Stacy stated she understood
               and I answered all questions she had. Charges of MIP Exhibiting
               will be forwarded to Juvenile Services. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 24th day of August, 2014, in Pullman,

               about 0135 Dispatch advised of a physical domestic at room 307
               Perham Hall. I responded and as I was going to the third floor
               Dispatch advised hall staff was on scene and the subjects were
               refusing to open the door. I requested one of the other
               officers responding retrieve the Knox Box keys so we could gain
               entry to the room if needed. Upon arriving on the 3rd floor I
               could see a group of people gathered near room 307. I was told
               a male and female had been arguing and a female was heard
               screaming inside room 307 and at one point said "let go of me".
               I knocked on the door several times, identified myself as a
               police officer, and asked them to come to the door. There was
               no response but I could hear movement inside the room
               indicating there was still someone inside. Officer Petlovany
               arrived with keys for the room and I announced that if they did
               not open the door we were going to use keys to gain entry to
               the room. There was no response. Officer Petlovany opened the
               door to room 307 with the keys. The security chain was latched
               so I kicked the door to force it open. We found two subjects
               inside the room who were later identified as Kristin M. Wilken
               (110895) and Jovanny M. Vega (090190). They were both naked and
               acting like they were asleep, each one in a different bed. I
               directed them both to show me their hands at which point Wilken
               asked if it was a joke. I told her it was not and directed them
               to put some clothes on so we could speak with both of them.
               Vega complied and began getting dressed while Wilken argued
               saying she wanted to close the door because she was
               embarrassed. Due to the nature of the call I told her I was not
               going to close the door and told her again to put some clothes
               on. Eventually she agreed to get a blanket to cover herself. It
               was clear Wilken was intoxicated. I could smell a strong odor
               of intoxicants, she had bloodshot and watery eyes, and spoke
               with slightly slurred speech. Once Vega was clothed I directed
               him to the nearby outdoor deck area of the 3rd floor. I told
               him we were called because there was a report of an argument
               between he and Wilken and I asked him what happened. He told me
               He and Wilken had been arguing because she did not want him
               talking to other girls. She saw him talking with some other
               girls earlier in the night and thought he was hitting on them.

               Wilken said at no time was the argument physical between them.
               I asked him several times why we were told a female was heard
               saying let me go in the room. All he would say is that he was
               trying to talk to Wilken and she was very angry with him. As he
               said this he motioned with his arms, spreading them apart, as
               if he were trying to keep someone from leaving. I asked about
               the loud banging reported by the witnesses and he said Wilken
               was angry and threw several of her own items in the room. He
               said she never threw anything at him during the argument. As I
               was speaking with Vega I could smell the odor of intoxicants on
               his breath and noticed he had bloodshot and watery eyes. I
               spoke to Officer Petlovany, who told me Wilken claimed nothing
               happened and the noises people heard were she and Vega having
               "rough sex". I relayed what Vega told me to Officer Petlovany.
               I spoke to the two people identified as witnesses to the event,
               Corby M. Abel (032796) and Samantha R. Sefton (030596). They
               told me they saw Wilken and Vega arguing in the hallway
               earlier. They thought it had something to do with Vega using
               the girls bathroom on the 3rd floor and not flushing the
               toilet. They said Vega stopped and was talking to several girls
               in a room who had their door open. Vega made some comments
               about how annoying his girlfriend was, which further angered
               Wilken. At one point Vega was walking down the hall away from
               Wilken when, according to Abel, Wilken swung a coat/jacket at
               Vega's back. Vega turned around and grabbed Wilken, to stop her
               from doing anything further. Vega and Wilken went into Wilken's
               room where they continued to yell at each other and argue. Able
               and Sefton heard some loud bangs, which they described as
               sounding like something being dropped on the floor, as well as
               a female scream. As I was speaking with Abel and Sefton I asked
               Officer Petlovany to speak to Wilken about what happened with
               the jacket in the hallway. She continued to deny there was any
               physical confrontation between she and Vega. I asked Vega about
               the jacket in the hallway and the report of him grabbing
               Wilken. He denied anything physical happened during the
               argument. Neither Wilken or Vega had any physical signs of a
               fight or struggle occurring between them. The room was in
               disarray, as if some things had been thrown around the room
               during the argument. I told Vega it would be a good idea if he
               stayed somewhere else for the night so they could both sober up
               before trying to work things out. He said he was from out of
               town but had some friends he could go stay with. Vega gathered
               his things from Wilkin's room and went with Sergeant Macy to
               wait for Officer Petlovany to retrieve a DV crime victims
               packet. I provided a DV packet to Wilken along with the case
               number. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 23 day of August,
               2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W3020 SYNOPSIS: Report of a fire hydrant
               spraying water all over. It was determined to be a hydrant fill
               station for water trucks at a construction site which was not
               secured and likely turned on by a passerby. NAME/DOB ACTION

               hrs Dispatch advised of a report there was a fire hydrant
               across the street from the Marriott Hotel which was spraying
               water all over. I responded to the area and found the fire
               hydrant and a large amount of water spraying from a water truck
               fill station which was hooked to the hydrant. The fill station
               is for a construction site at that location and was not
