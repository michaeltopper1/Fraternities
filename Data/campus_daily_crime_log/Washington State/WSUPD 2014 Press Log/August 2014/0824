               contacted the complainant/victim Otierney, Ian D. (01/04/96).
               He told me that both of the side mounted rear view mirrors were
               broken off of his vehicle, AJA7094/WA. Otierney last saw his
               vehicle in tact on Friday, August 22, 2014 at about 1500 hours.
               A piece of his mirror was on the pavement near the driver's

               $200.00. Otierney has no idea who may have damaged his vehicle.

               vehicles with damaged mirrors. A total of five (5) vehicles
               parked in the lot had damaged mirrors. I was able to speak with

               broken off. I was not able to speak with the victim. I left my

               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On August 24, 2014 at about 1953
               hours Pullman Fire and WSU Police were dispatched to a fire
               alarm at Stephenson North. I responded to the building. Upon my
               arrival I was told by hall staff that the alarm was likely
               caused by cooking smoke on the 13th floor. Pullman Fire
               personnel and I determined that the alarm was caused by cooking
               on the 13th floor in the kitchen area. There was no fire or
               flame, just smoke from frying SPAM. The kitchen vent fan was
               not able to vent the cooking vapors well enough. There was no
               fire emergency or damage. No further investigation. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.
