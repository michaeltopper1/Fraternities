               hours I came across a disabled vehicle on Grand Ave at Stadium

               blocking the bus stop. The male registered owner told me that

               It was pushed out of the intersection to it's current location.
               The male thought the alternator may have gone out. He requested
               the next rotational tow truck to take it to Jess Ford. Myers
               Towing responded and cleared the vehicle from the roadway per
               the owner's request. I communicated with the PPD OIC and a PPD

               and Student Conduct. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               Reese M. Duringer/050595 Arrest MIP Forward Charges 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 08/18/14 at about 0031 hrs I was driving on
               College Ave near Stimson Hall when I noticed a male, later
               identified as Reese M. Duringer (050595), who was walking east
               in front of Stimson Hall. Duringer caught my attention because
               he appeared to be under the age of 21 and was having difficulty
               walking, staggering side to side. I stopped and contacted
               Duringer as he was trying to enter Stimson Hall. I asked
               Duringer if he lived there and he said he did. I asked what
               room and he said 919. I told Duringer there was no room 919 in
               Stimson Hall and asked what the name of his dorm was. He
               initially mumbled something about Duncan. I was eventually able
               to determine he lived in Stephenson North room 919. As I spoke
               with Duringer I could smell the odor of intoxicants on his
               breath. Duringer spoke with slurred speech and swayed side to
               side as he stood. I asked Duringer if I could check his eyes to
               see how much he had to drink and he agreed. I administered a
               horizontal gaze nystagmus test on him. I observed he had
               bloodshot and watery eyes, a lack of smooth pursuit, and a
               distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation. I asked
               Duringer if he would provide a breath sample and he refused. I
               had Duringer move to the grass near my patrol car so I could
               confirm where he lived in the WSU computer system, which I did.
               Duringer was able to answer most of my questions correctly but
               he was confused as to where he was, likely due to it being his
               first night on campus. I advised Duringer I would be forwarding
               charges to the Whitman County prosecutor for MIP Exhibiting. I
               also advised him the incident would be referred to student
               conduct. I provided Duringer with a courtesy transport to
               Stephenson North and I made sure he got to his room ok. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 18 day of August, 2014, in Pullman,

               08/18/14 at about 0145 hrs I was driving northbound on Stadium
               Way from Grimes Way when I noticed a group of four subjects
               walking southbound on Stadium Way near French Administration.
               They caught my attention because one of the subjects, later
               identified as Abigail E. Bohman (042996), appeared to be under
               the age of 21 and was having difficulty walking, staggering
               side to side as she walked. I stopped and contacted the group
               on the corner of Stadium Way and Grimes Way. I asked if I could
               speak with them and they agreed. I asked Bohman how much she
               had to drink and she initially denied having consumed alcohol.
               I could see she was swaying in a circular motion as she stood.
               I asked if I could check her eyes to make sure she had not been
               drinking and she agreed. I administered a horizontal gaze
               nystagmus test on her and observed she had bloodshot and watery
               eyes, a lack of smooth pursuit, and a distinct and sustained
               nystagmus at maximum deviation. Bohman had difficulty standing
               with her feet together and had to stand with her feet about
               shoulder width apart to keep from stumbling. I could smell the
               odor of intoxicants on her breath. As I was speaking with
               Bohman I asked Officer Westerman to identify the other
               individuals. They were identified as Sarah E. Steinman
               (071296), Lora C. Sullivan (032596), and Harrison J. Pearce
               (122795). Throughout the contact I did not see any signs
               Steinman, Sullivan, or Pearce had been consuming alcohol. They
               all said they were just trying to walk Bohman home to make sure
               she got home safely. I told Bohman she was being arrested and I
               would be forwarding charges to the Whitman County Prosecutor
               for MIP Exhibiting. I told her the incident would also be sent
               to student conduct. Bohman was released and allowed to walk
               home with her friends. Nothing further. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W2918 SYNOPSIS: Agency assist for Whitman
               County on a Domestic Dispute. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 08/18/14 at about 0200 hrs I
               heard Whitman County Deputies dispatched to a domestic dispute
               at 6202 SR 270. I recognized the address from a previous
               domestic incident I responded to with deputies approximately
               two weeks prior. I knew the suspect, Jedidiah D. Adams
               (102688), was having some mental issues according to his family
               and had been violent with his brother on the previous occasion.
               I heard WCSO Sergeant Chapman respond and arrive on scene.
               Shortly later I heard Deputy DeRosier advise he was on SR 195
               near Prune Orchard Rd. I was on SR 270 at Airport Rd at the
               time and responded to assist Sergeant Chapman because Deputy
               DeRosier was still quite a ways away. Upon my arrival I found
               Jedidiah laying prone in the gravel driveway near the house
               with Sergeant Chapman there. I assisted as Sergeant Chapman
               detained Jedidiah in handcuffs and placed him in his patrol
               car. I went to the residence to check on the complainant,
               Samuel J. Adams (102688). As I approached the front door I
               could see a sidelight window was broken out of the entryway
               with glass laying all over the ground both inside and outside
               the residence. I called into the residence and made contact
               with Samuel and his girlfriend, Brandi R. Griswold (012290).
               Samuel told me he and Brandi had been in bed when his brother
               broke into the house and came into the bedroom. Jedidiah
               started hitting Samuel, yelling about wanting his things and
               saying he was going to take the dog. Samuel attempted to defend
               himself and with Brandi's help was able to push Samuel down the
               stairs. I could see several scratches/abrasions on Samuel's
               right arm. He also showed me several abrasions on his back. I
               photographed the abrasions as well as the damage to the
               entryway of the house. Samuel told me Jedidiah has been told to
               stay out of the house but may have a spare key from their
               parents which they have yet to get back from him. I relayed the
               information to Sergeant Chapman. I remained on scene while
               Sergeant Chapman spoke with Brandi and Samuel. See related WCSO
               case for additional information. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               18 day of August, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.
