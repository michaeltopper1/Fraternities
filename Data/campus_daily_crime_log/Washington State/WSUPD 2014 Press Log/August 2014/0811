    Narrative: RVWD:MJG/309 / OFC: BRW/325 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W2826 SYNOPSIS: Disabled School Bus
               blocking one lane of eastbound Stadium Way. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 08/11/14 at
               approximately 1652 hours, I responded to a disabled School Bus
               that was located on Stadium Way near Olympia Ave. Upon arrival
               I found the School Bus in the outside eastbound lane of Stadium
               Way. The bus was smoking from the rear of the bus heavily. I
               walked up to the bus and saw a large amount of antifreeze
               pouring from the engine area of the bus. The WSU football team
               had been on the bus at the time it broke down. All the
               occupants and exited the bus prior to my arrival. I contacted
               the bus driver, Mary Jo Price 04/05/57, who said the bus began
               to overheat when they were going up the Lewiston Grade. Price
               said the bus leveled off till they turned onto Stadium Way.
               Once on Stadium Way the bus lost all power and began to smoke
               heavily. Price already had another bus on the way to take the
               football players the rest of the way. I asked Price if she
               wanted a two truck. Price said her boss called over to the
               Moscow School District and one of their mechanics was on his
               way. I had the Pullman Fire Department respond for the
               antifreeze spill. They covered the spill area with absorbent
               and left. I later had FacOps come out and sweep up all the
               absorbent. The mechanic was able to patch the bus up enough to
               move it off Stadium Way and onto Nevada St where they would try
               to repair the bus. Once the bus was moved off Stadium Way I
               cleared. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 11th day of August,
               2014, in Pullman, Washington.
