               UNIVERSITY POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W2832 SYNOPSIS: RP
               stated that his Trek bicycle was stolen from underneath the
               stairs of Steptoe Apartment Building "V". RP said his bike was
               locked up. No leads or suspects at this time. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 08-12-14 at
               approximately 1110 hours Cpl. Daniels called and told me I had
               an individual waiting in the front lobby wanting to report a
               theft. I headed downstairs and met with RP Sakdipon Juasrikul
               (DOB 12-20-77) who wanted to report his stolen Trek Bicycle.
               Juasrikul told me that he always parks his bicycle underneath
               the stairs at the Steptoe Apartments Building "V" where he
               lives. He told me he lives on the third floor, but he always
               puts it in the same spot on the first floor in order to keep it
               dry from the water sprinklers and so he can keep it in the
               shade. Juasrikul assured me that his bike was locked and is
               always locked with a heavy duty cable lock. I asked him when
               was the last time he saw his bike and he said he saw it last
               night 08-11-14 at approximately 1930 hours when he was heading
               up the stairs to his apartment for the rest of the night.
               Juasrikul said when he went downstairs this morning at
               approximately 1030 hours to get his bike to ride it to work, it
               was no longer there. I asked him if his lock was still there
               and he said the lock was gone. He told me his bike is a Trek X-
               Caliber 6 and it is black, white, and silver in color. He said
               it is a 29" bike and the serial number is WTU116C9562H.
               Juasrikul told me that his bike is worth $800.00 and that he
               purchased it from B&L Bicycles in Pullman. I asked him if there
               were any distinguishing marks on his bike and he said there is
               a horizontal scratch on the front of the left fork. I asked him
               if he has an idea of who may have taken his bike and he told me
               no. He told me that he normally rides his bike to work on
               campus and parks it in front of Todd. He said the last time he
               rode is bike was on 08-10-14. I gave Juasrikul my e-mail
               address and contact phone number and asked him to please send
               me an e-mail with a picture of his bike and to call if he had
               any other questions (see attached photo). Cpl. Daniels and I
               drove around Steptoe Apartments and various surrounding
               apartment buildings to see if we could spot Juasrikul's bike,
               but were unable to find it. I completed a teletype form for
               stolen property and gave it to records so it could be entered
               into NCIC. No leads or suspects at this time. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               themselves Elizabeth Soliday. I believe the person calling

               NARRATIVE: On 08-12-13, Robert G. Hanson (09-25-90), called
               Whitcom asking to speak with an Officer regarding a possible
               fraud. He said he had been e-mailing someone calling themselves
               Elizabeth Soliday (a Professor at WSU Vancouver) regarding a
               job. Hanson said the person calling themselves Soliday was
               advertising a job opening as a part - time Administrative
               Assistant. Hanson was offered the job after a few exchanged e-
               mails and told his first job duty was to print off two checks,
               which were sent via e-mail, and take them and deposit them into
               his bank. He was then to take money out of his account and send
               it to an orphanage for supplies. Hanson did not feel this
               sounded right so he did not follow through with anything. He
               said he will e-mail me copies of the e-mails he received.
               Investigation continues. I certify and declare under penalty of
