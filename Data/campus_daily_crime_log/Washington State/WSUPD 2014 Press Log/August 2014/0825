               the vehicle was in motion on Stadium Way near North Fairway. A
               drivers check through WA showed the driver, Robert N. Ackerley
               09-20-1993, was suspended 3rd for an unpaid ticket. Ackerley

               I was on patrol in an unmarked patrol vehicle in full uniform
               and the driver side window rolled down. I was on Stadium Way
               approaching North Fairway from Orchard in the curbside lane
               when I looked to my left and saw the defendant holding an
               electronic device near the bottom of the steering wheel with
               both hands on the device and his thumbs moving as if texting. I
               also noticed his head was tilted down as if reading what was
               being typed. I pulled in behind the vehicle, a black Mini
               Cooper with WA license AFJ6006 and activated my vehicles
               emergency lights as the vehicle turned from Stadium Way onto
               Wilson Road. The vehicle stopped and I contacted the driver who
               was identified as Robert N. Ackerley 09-20-1993. I told him the
               reason for the stop and at first he said he was using his GPS.
               When I told him I could see his thumbs moving as if typing, he
               didn't deny texting while driving. Ackerley provided a
               registration for the vehicle but no proof of insurance. I told
               him to continue looking for the proof while I ran a drivers
               check. The drivers check showed he was suspended in the 3rd for
               unpaid tickets. I asked Ackerley about the unpaid ticket and he
               said he had received a speeding ticket, but sent his father
               money to take care of the ticket. Officer Jones arrived on
               scene and we checked Ackerley's ADR. It showed the unpaid was
               an inattention ticket in Seattle municipal court. I asked
               Ackerley about that he seemed to have a vague memory of getting
               the ticket and not taking care of it. I issued Ackerley
               citation C-8801 for DWLS 3rd and he was advised not to drive. I
               did allow him to park his car in a spot on Wilson road that was
               3 spaces ahead of him. nothing further. I certify and declare

               Operations Building. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 08-25-14 myself and Officer Westerman were
               dispatched to a possible trespassing on the walkway of the
               Football Operations Building. Upon our arrival we contacted the
               intern. He stated that it was their orders to keep people from
               watching practice since it was a closed practice. He had asked
               an unidentified male(who was standing art the railing watching
               us) to leave since it was a closed practice. There male told
               him he had the right to be there since it was a public walkway.
               The intern told him that if he didn't leave he would be calling
               an officer to come deal with the situation. The male said go
               ahead. The male was standing on a walkway that was open to the
               public and had the right to be there. I explain to the intern
               that we had no right to ask him to leave unless he was causing
               a safety concern or was being disorderly. I also said there is
               some sort of communication error and I would be contacting the
               Assistant Chief to resolve the issue. We contacted the male,
               who identified himself as a Spokesman Review reporter, and told
               him that he had the right to be there unless he was causing a
               safety problem or was being disorderly. He said he hadn't done
               either. I told him we were sorry for the mis-understanding. We
               thanked him for his cooperation and left the area. Since we had
               no reason to identify the male I didn't request his
               information. I contacted Intern Coordinator Officer Stewart
               about the situation. He said he would be contacting someone
               from football to ratify the situation. Nothing

               POLICE DEPARTMENT ** COLLISION REPORT ** CASE #: 14-W3075
               SYNOPSIS: Turner backed into a parked car when pulling out of a
               parking stall. DRIVER 1: John Ray Turner 06/16/82 VEHICLE 1:
               WA/AJL2845 2008 Dodge Avenger INSURANCE: Safeco PA# H2163789
               DAMAGE: $300 to passenger's side rear bumper and tail light
               DRIVER 2: Elizabeth Marie Bryant 05/10/78 VEHICLE 2: ID/AK907
               2005 Toyota 4Runner INSURANCE: Geico PA# 2022509174 DAMAGE:
               $300 to the passenger's side rear bumper NARRATIVE: On 08/25/14
               at approximately 1638 hours, I was dispatched to a non-injury
               collision on the 2nd floor of the CUE parking garage. The
               reporting party John Ray Turner 06/16/82, had called reporting
               that he backed into a parked car. Upon arrival I found Turner
               standing next to his car. Turner said there was an open parking
               stall behind him so he decided to back straight back before
               pulling forward. When Turner backed up he misjudged the car
               behind him and his passenger's side rear bumper corner struck
               the passenger side rear bumper corner of a 2005 Toyota 4Runner.
               Turner inspected the damage and called 911. The passenger's
               side rear bumper corner on Turner's car had been pushed in and
               the tail light was shattered. The passenger's side rear bumper
               corner of the 4Runner had scratches in the paint and where the
               bumper met the rear quarter panel had separated. The estimated
               value of damage to each car is $300 dollars. I took photographs
               of the damage to both cars and provided Turner with his case
               number. I left my business card on the 4Runner asking the owner
               to call me. About 1720 hours, the owner of the 4Runner,
               Elizabeth Marie Bryant 05/10/78, called stating she was at her
               car. I responded back to the CUE parking garage. I explained to
               Bryant what had happened and provided her with my business card
               and her case number. I explained how to turn this case over to
               insurance if she choose to. Bryant said she understood. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 25th day of August, 2014 in Pullman,

               was stolen. I found the Jeep parked in the same parking lot
               Guffey said he had parked it in. There is no evidence that the
               vehicle was ever taken. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               2. NARRATIVE: On 08/25/14 at approximately 2032 hours, I was
               dispatched to a automobile theft in the area of Southside Cafe.
               Dispatch stated the Jeep was parked in the lower lot of
               Southside when it was taken. I drove to the lower lot of
               Southside and found the vehicle parked in a parking stall. I
               met with the reporting party, Nathanael Lee Guffey 11/05/80,
               who said he parked his car in the lower lot of Southside Cafe
               around 1100 hours. When Guffey got off work around 2000 hours
               he did not find his car where he believed he had parked it. I
               told Guffey that I found his car in the parking lot that he had
               described. We walked to the Jeep and Guffey said he did not
               think he had parked there. Guffey thought he had parked closer
               to Southside. I had Guffey look at his car and he said there
               was no new damage. Guffey said he did not know if he locked his
               doors or not when he parked it. Guffey found his doors to be
               unlocked. Guffey looked around his car and said nothing was
               missing. I asked Guffey if it was possible that he had just
               forgot where he parked his car. Guffey said he was pretty sure
               he parked it closer. I asked Guffey if there was anything else
               I could do for him and he said no. It is most likely that
               Guffey had forgotten where exactly in the parking lot he had
               parked his car. There is no evidence that Guffey's vehicle was
               ever taken. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 25th day of

               approximately 0030 hours, I was on foot patrol in the area of
               Colorado Street and the PE building when I saw a male
               staggering from side to side toward me. It appeared he was
               having a hard time walking in a straight and he appeared under
               the age of 21. I contacted the subject, later identified as
               Andrew Lamb, and asked him if I could talk to him. He told me I
               could and I asked him how old he was. He told me he was 18
               years old. At that point, I activated my VieVu body camera and
               advised him I was recording the encounter. I asked him how much
               he had to drink and he stated, "Too much." I asked him how old
               he was and he told me 18. I asked him if he would be willing to
               let me check his eyes and he told me I could. I asked him to
               stand with his arms at his sides and to follow the tip of my
               pen with his eyes and eyes only. I moved my pen to his left and
               he moved his whole head to the left. I again told him to not
               move his head and attempted the test again. He again moved his
               head. I advised him a third time and he continued moving his
               head. I deduced that he was too intoxicated to following my
               instructions. While talking with Lamb, I noticed his speech was
               extremely slurred, his eyes were bloodshot and watery, his face
               was flushed and his body swayed while he stood talking to me. I
               asked him if he would be willing to provide a PBT sample and he
               refused and told me he wanted a lawyer. I advised Lamb that I
               was forwarding charges to the Whitman County Prosecutor's
               Office for minor exhibiting the effects of having consumed
               alcohol in a public place. I also advised him that I would be
               forwarding my report to the office of student standards and
               accountability for a violation of the alcohol policies here at
               WSU. Lamb told me he understood. Lamb was able to answer all my
               general questions, so I determined he was not too intoxicated
               to care for himself. He was released. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 26th day of August, 2014, in Pullman,

               J. Divalerio/051496 Cited MIP 4Z0810104 2. NARRATIVE: On
               08/26/14 at about 0038 hrs I was out with Officer Stewart, who
               was speaking with an intoxicated male, along Colorado St. near
               the Physical Education Building when I noticed a male and
               female who were walking eastbound along Colorado St. toward us.
               The male caught my attention because he appeared to be under
               the age of 21 and was having difficulty walking, staggering
               side to side. I asked if I could stop and talk to them and they
               both stopped. I asked how much they had to drink. The male,
               later identified as Scott J. Divalero (051496), admitted to
               having had several drinks. I asked if they had ID with them and
               Divalero provided me with his WA driver's license, which
               confirmed he was under the age of 21. The female provided me
               with her name and date of birth. I did not observe any signs of
               alcohol consumption from the female so I told her she was free
               to go and she left. The female was not attached to the case
               because there was no indication of alcohol consumption. I asked
               Divalero if I could check his eyes to see how much he had to
               drink and he said yes. I administered a horizontal gaze
               nystagmus test and observed he had bloodshot and watery eyes, a
               lack of smooth pursuit, and a distinct and sustained nystagmus
               at maximum deviation in both eyes. He swayed side to side
               during the test and I had to remind him not to move his head
               during the test. I could smell the odor of intoxicants on
               Divalero's breath as I administered the test. I asked Divalero
               how much alcohol was in the backpack he was wearing. He said
               probably a couple beers. He took the backpack of and showed me
               it contained two full cans of beer. I asked him if he had ever
               been arrested before and he said he was arrested for MIP once
               back at home. I walked with him to a nearby dumpster where I
               had him pour out and dispose of the beer cans. I advised
               Divalero he was under arrest for MIP Exhibiting and directed
               him to walk to my patrol car. As we were walking to my patrol
               car he became somewhat verbally uncooperative. He began asking
               why he was under arrest and what proof I had he was
               intoxicated. I told him I could smell the odor of intoxicants
               on his breath, he was speaking with slurred speech, and he was
               even using the wall to balance as we walked to my patrol car. I
               placed him in handcuffs (double locked) to avoid him becoming
               physically uncooperative. I had him sit in the back of my

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W3084 SYNOPSIS: Report of a female being
               followed by a suspicious male. The male was identified but no
               crimes committed. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Alan
               D. Cannon/090946 Contacted 2. NARRATIVE: On 08/26/14 I was
               starting to drive down Linden St. from Thatuna Rd. when I heard
               a female voice near the rear of my patrol vehicle. I could see
               a female, later identified as Emily R. Dingman (032695), in my
               passenger side mirror who appeared to be trying to catch up to
               my vehicle. I stopped and Dingman came to my car saying she was
               on the phone with her friend, who was being followed by an
               unknown male. I asked where her friend was and she said running
               from the male on Colorado St. near the track. I knew Officer
               Stewart was in that area and asked if he could see a female
               running from a male and he said no. I had Dingman get in my
               patrol car and we began driving down Colorado St. toward
               Stadium Way to find her friend, whom she was still on the phone
               with. We found her friend, Maxxine N. Lepper (022296), along
               Colorado St. near Northside Hall. Lepper was clearly distraught
               and concerned by what just occurred. After giving her a moment
               to calm down she was able to tell me there was a male wearing
               baggy clothes and pulling a rolling suitcase who had been
               following her and yelling at her. I gave the suspect
               description to Officer Stewart and Sergeant Macy so they could
               begin looking for him. Lepper told me she had been walking back
               to her sorority and planned to walk from Stadium Way, up Wilson
               Rd. and cross campus. As she approached the intersection of
               Wilson Rd. and Stadium Way she noticed a male wearing baggy
               clothes and holding a rolling suitcase standing near the
               intersection. She decided to take the longer walk up Stadium
               Way to Colorado St. and down Colorado St. to avoid the male,
               who was now calling out to her. She said he started out by
               saying, "Hey, hey baby". As Lepper began walking away from the
               male he started to follow her, which made her increasingly
               concerned for her safety. She said as she continued to pick up
               her walking pace, eventually to the point of running, the male
               kept following her and calling out to her. The male followed
               her from the intersection of Stadium Way and Colorado St. to
               Flag Ln. She was not sure where the male went after that.
               Lepper said the male never made any specific threats of harm or
               motions to indicate he was going to hurt her. She was just very
               concerned because she did not know the male and he was yelling
               at her and following her as she was trying to get away from
               him. Officer Stewart and Sergeant Griffin found a male matching

               the description near the cougar statue on Stadium Way. I asked
               Lepper if she would recognize the male again if she saw him and
               she said she thought so. I told her there were two other
               officers out with someone who may or may not be the man who was
               following her. I asked if she would let me drive her past the
               location to see if it was the right person. She agreed and I
               drove her and Dingman past the location. She told me on a scale
               of 1-10, with 10 being the highest she was 10 of 10 sure that
               the male, later identified as Alan D. Cannon was the one who
               had been following her. I provided Lepper and Dingman with a
               courtesy transport to their sorority at 820 Campus St. I
               provided Lepper with my business card and the case number.
               Sergeant Griffin told me Cannon appeared to be a homeless
               veteran who was new to the area. Cannon denied following a girl
               and would not say why he was on campus. Nothing further. I

               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 26 day of August, 2014, in Pullman,

               NARRATIVE: On 082614 at approximately 0136 hours, I was driving
               SB on SE Spokane Street in the area of Washington Street when I
               noticed three females walking toward Stadium Way along Spokane
               Street. I noticed one of the females, later identified as
               Veronica White, having a hard time walking in a straight line.
               She was staggering from one side of the sidewalk to the other.
               I drove past White and she appeared to be under the age of 21.
               I contacted the three and asked White how old she was. She told
               me she was eighteen. I asked her how much alcohol she had to
               drink and she told me she had a few at a friend's house. I
               activated my VieVu body camera and recorded the contact. I
               asked her if she would provide a PBT sample and she refused. I
               asked her if I could check her eyes and she told me I could. I
               asked her to follow the tip of my pen with her eyes and not to
               move her head. As I began moving my pen, she moved her head and
               I had to tell her again to not move her head. As I moved my pen
               from side to side, I noticed a lack of smooth pursuit, distinct
               and sustained nystagmus and maximum deviation and the onset of
               nystagmus in both eyes at approximately 20 degrees. I also
               noticed a strong odor of intoxicants coming from White's
               breath, her eyes were bloodshot and watery, she had slurred
               speech and her body swayed while I was talking to her. I asked
               White several questions to make sure she was unable to care for
               herself and she answered my questions correctly. I asked her
               friends to care for her the rest of the night due to her
               extreme intoxication. I explained to White that I was
               forwarding charges on her to the Whitman County Prosecutor's
               Office for MIP-Exhibiting. I also explained that she would be
               sent to WSU Student Conduct as well. I told White she was
               released and her friends walked her home. Forward to WSU
               Student Conduct. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing

               approximately 0248 hours, I was driving SB on Stadium Way, and
               I made a left turn onto Nevada Street. As I turned onto Nevada
               Street, I noticed two males standing on the corner of Nevada
               Street and Stadium Way waiting for the crosswalk. As I drove
               past, one of the males, I recognized as Edward Froste, was
               holding a 40oz beer in his hand. As I was driving away from the
               two males, I saw Froste take a drink of the beer. I turned
               around and contacted the two males activating my VieVu body

               Servici, and he told me he was 18 years old. I noticed he was
               wearing a bath robe, so I asked him where his clothes were. He
               told me he went to a party on greek row and wore his robe. I
               asked him where he was drinking and he told me he drank at the
               frat house. I asked him if he was a pledge and he told me he
               was. Froste asked me if he was free to leave, and I warned him
               for drinking in public and asked him to dump out the rest of
               his beer and he complied. I asked him if he gave Servici the
               alcohol to drink and he told me that he didn't. Froste told me
               they had just met. I told him he could leave and he did. While
               talking to Servici, I noticed he had bloodshot and watery eyes,
               slurred speech, and his breath smelled strongly of intoxicants.
               I explained to Servici that I was going to forward my police
               report to WSU Student Conduct and they would be getting in
               touch with him in a week or two. He told me he understood. I
               asked him if he had any questions and he told me he didn't. I
               told him he was released. Forward to WSU Student Conduct. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 26th day of August, 2014, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer
