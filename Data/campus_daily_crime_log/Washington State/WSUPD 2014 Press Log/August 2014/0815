    Narrative: RVWD: BEJ/314 OFC: ENW/328 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W2857 SYNOPSIS: Report of two panic alarm
               activations from Johnson Tower 375. The alarms were determined
               to an employee error. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               2. NARRATIVE: On 081514 around 0849 hrs Ofc Jones and I were
               dispatched to a report of two panic alarm activations from
               Johnson Tower 375. Upon my arrival I noticed the door leading
               into the Psychology Clinic was open and I could see furniture
               stacked in the hallway. I also contacted Francis A Benjamin
               (083061), who was moving items from an office, and was told the
               following. Benjamin explained he was the IT person for the
               Psychology Clinic and was moving items so the custodial crew
               could clean when he removed one of the panic alarms. He went on
               to tell me he was removing the batteries and must have
               activated the alarm by mistake. We spoke for a few minutes more
               and I told him to contact us when he was going to be working on
               the alarms and was told he would before I cleared a short time
               later. This incident was determined to be caused by an employee
               error and I recommend this case be closed. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 15th day of August, 2014, in Pullman,

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W2860 SYNOPSIS: Request for an evaluation
               of an employee thought to have been consuming alcohol. Subject
               was provided a courtesy transport home. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 081514 around 1302 hrs I was
               dispatched to a report of an individual, later identified as
               Rebecca S Beach (120557), who was believed to have been
               consuming alcohol while at work as a custodian for Washington
               State University. Ofc Jones and I responded and contacted Beach
               and her supervisor, later identified as Daniel S Costello
               (082664), who told us the following. Costello explained that it
               had been brought to his attention one of his employee's, Beach,
               had been consuming alcohol while working as a custodian in
               Daggy Hall. He went on to ask us to speak with her and
               determine if she had been consuming alcohol. Ofc Jones and I
               sat down and spoke with Beach and were told the following.
               Beach, who was visibly nervous as we spoke, explained that she
               was upset over a fellow employee making accusations such as
               this. We spoke briefly about this during which time she would
               try to keep her head turned away from my direction. We
               continued to speak during which I detected a slight slur in her
               words, which based upon my training and experience is a sign of
               someone having consumed alcohol. When asked if she had consumed
               any alcohol today (08-15-14) she told us she had not. At this
               point I noticed the odor of intoxicants coming from her
               direction and asked her if she would be willing to provide a
               voluntary breath sample. Beach initially declined to answer the
               question and began to direct her questions at Costello. At this
               point I explained to Beach that if she had not consumed any
               alcohol then their wouldn't be an issue with us. Beach was
               concerned about how this issue would appear to her co-workers
               at which point Jones and I explained as far as anyone knew we
               were speaking with her regarding a case we were investigating.
               Beach sat silent for a moment at which point I asked her if she
               would be willing to provide a breath sample. Beach lowered her
               head and shook it indicating she did not want to. I asked her
               again, at which point she quietly told me she did not wish to
               provide a sample. I continued to speak with Beach at which
               point I asked her to blow onto my hand, which was placed
               approximately 6 inches away from her mouth, like she was
               filling a balloon. Beach took a deep breath and began to blow
               out through her nose at which point I instructed her to blow
               onto my hand. Beach then took a deep breath and acted like she
               was blowing onto my hand before providing a quick puff of

               breath. Upon her breathing onto my hand I noticed the odor of
               intoxicants coming from her breath. We then began to speak
               about her statement regarding not having consuming any alcohol.
               I told her that I believed that she either had a medical
               condition which caused me concern or she had been consuming
               alcohol. She then proceeded to tell me she was hypoglycemic and
               she tries to eat every two hours, but does not take insulin.
               Around this point I asked Jones to speak with Beach, while I
               went into the hallway to speak with Costello. Upon my return I
               sat back down and Jones confirmed he had also noticed the odor
               of intoxicants coming from Beach's breath. We continued to
               speak for a few more minutes before Beach agreed to allow Ofc
               Jones or I to provide her with a ride home. Beach retrieved her
               belongings and Jones provided her with a courtesy transport
               while I spoke with Costello. I explained to him what Jones and
               I had observed and he thanked us for our help before I cleared.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 15th day of August, 2014, in

               folding chairs and one (1) box fan from the front porch area of
               Kamiak Apt C7. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On August 15, 2014 at about 1500 hours I was
               dispatched to the report of a theft of chairs from Kamiak
               Apartment C7. Whitcom advised there was a language barrier and
               they did not have full reporting party information. I responded
               to the apartment where I contacted the complainant/victim, Al
               Alawi, Ahmed Saib Naji (10/08/74). I spoke with him on his
               front porch area. There was a couch, dressers, a microwave,
               several chairs and a bar stool out in front of the apartment.
               He told me that a large dark skinned Indian woman took his box
               fan from his front porch. The fan was blowing air into his
               apartment. In addition two (2) dark colored folding chairs were
               taken from the front porch in the past 24 hours. Al Alawi
               wanted to know what he can do to keep people from taking his
               belongings. He said he can't fit all the furniture into his one
               bedroom apartment. Some of the items are going to be given to
               his friend. The friend is not coming to Pullman until October.
               There are no signs on the furniture indicating it as free or
               private property. I told him that the furniture should be
               removed from the front porch area as it restricts emergency
               egress. I spoke with Al Alawi about Washington law and what he
               can and can't do. He had a lot of questions and just wanted to
               speak with an officer as he is not from the United States. The
               white box fan is valued at $20.00. The two (2) folding chairs
               are valued at $20.00. The total loss is $40.00. It is unknown
               who the Indian woman's identity is. There are no further leads
               at this time. No further investigation. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               told him that an ice cream truck would come if he did. Upon
               arrival I found a group of about 5 younger kids near the

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Boyd/335 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W2866 SYNOPSIS: Subject arrested, cited,
               and released for DWLS 3rd deg. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Erin K. Gualco Kutsch Cited/Released DWLS 3rd
               4Z0615076 2. NARRATIVE: On 08/15/14 at about 2224 hrs I was
               parked near Martin Stadium monitoring traffic on Stadium Way
               when I noticed a vehicle that was driving southbound on Stadium
               Way. The vehicle, WA AHL0037, caught my attention because it
               appeared to be traveling faster than the posted 20 MPH speed
               limit. I activated my handheld radar unit (MPH Scout) which
               emitted a high pitched audio doppler tone that was steady in
               pitch. I observed a display on the radar unit of 28 MPH. The
               suspect vehicle was the only moving vehicle in the radar field
               and the readings were consistent with my visual estimate of the
               vehicle's speed. I turned in behind the vehicle and initiated a
               traffic stop, turning on my overhead lights. The vehicle
               stopped on Stadium Way near the Fine Arts parking garage. I
               contacted the driver, Erin K. Gualco Kutsch (120271), and told
               her the reason for the stop and the stop was being recorded. I
               asked Gualco Kutsch for her driver's license, vehicle
               registration, and proof of insurance. She provided me with her
               drivers license, insurance, and a report of sale for the
               vehicle. She told me her driver's license was suspended. I
               confirmed through Dispatch her driver's license was suspended.
               I issued Kualco Kutsch a citation for DWLS 3rd degree. I
               explained the citation to her, she received her copy, and was
               released. Her car was parked in a legal parking space and I
               provided her with a courtesy transport to downtown Pullman.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 16 day of August, 2014, in

        Time Reported: 23:41
    Time Occurred between: 23:41:37 08/15/14 - 23:41:37 08/15/14

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: mjp/327 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W2869 SYNOPSIS: It was thought a subject
               who needed to be served with a protection order lived on
               campus. They do not. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 081514 at approximately 2300 hours Pullman
               Records (Sally Tomasino) contacted me regarding paper service.
               She said Sgt. Dornes wanted to have us take over serving
               Michael B. Keadle (090181) with a protection order as the
               petitioner had listed him as living at Steptoe Apartments. I
               had her fax me the order and Ofc. Boyd and I went to the
               reported address. We went at this time as Pullman PD was
               actively working a call in which Keadle was suspected to be in
               the area of the petitioner. At Steptoe village we contacted the
               new resident of Building X-103 who was not Keadle. Ofc. Boyd
               was familiar with Keadle. The new resident had just moved in.
               We then checked WSU records and confirmed that Keadle had moved
               out weeks before and listed only a Pullman PO Box as an
               address. He does not appear to live in our jurisdiction. I met
               with Sgt. Dornes and other Pullman officers and determined that
               they had knowledge that led them to believe Keadle was homeless
               and living out of his vehicle in Pullman's jurisdiction. I told
               Sgt. Dornes that he may work at WSU but I could not determine
               where. Pullman PD is continuing with the service. We are not.
               Case closed. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 16th day of August, 2014, in
               Pullman, Washington. _______________________________________
