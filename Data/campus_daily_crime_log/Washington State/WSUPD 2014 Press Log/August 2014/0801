    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: DT/321 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W2727 SYNOPSIS: RP stated that he
               received a suspicious letter in his box today outside of his
               door which is located at Kruegel Hall 404 (Air Force ROTC). The
               letter was turned over to US Air Force Security for follow up.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 08-01-
               14 at approximately 1037 hours Ofc. Welter and I were
               dispatched to a suspicious person call from Kruegel Hall 404.
               Ofc. Welter contacted the RP Robert B. Washburn (DOB 11-12-
               1987) via phone. Washburn who is a Captain for WSU Air Force
               ROTC said he received a cryptic letter today in his box that
               seemed strange to him. Washburn said the envelope was
               postmarked out of Oakland, California but it had no return
               address. Washburn also said the envelope contained a photocopy
               of a rejection letter from the National Guard, which had been
               addressed to a Thomas Glover Jr. Washburn then said that he
               decided to google Glover's name and that he found a link for a
               possible homicide case out of Oakland which matched his name
               and it said to contact police with any information. Washburn
               said that he contacted us because of the link he had found and
               he also wanted to make sure this Thomas Glover wasn't anywhere
               on campus. Washburn asked for us to meet with him and take a
               look at the contents of the envelope. Ofc. Welter and I shortly
               arrived at Kruegel Hall 404 and met with Washburn. He showed
               Ofc. Welter the envelope and the contents inside (see attached
               files). The letter consisted of three pages which appeared to
               be a short summary of Glover's life and his passion for
               baseball. Another page appeared to have various addresses
               scribbled down. Another page had the rejection letter from the
               National Guard. Also,included inside was a piece of election
               mail addressed to Thomas Glover and an envelope addressed to
               Maj. Bill Donahue of the United American Patriots Warrior Fund.
               The letter was nothing but photocopies and it had been
               addressed to the old Air Force ROTC building Thompson Hall,
               instead of it's new location Kruegel. As we continued to speak
               with Washburn he told us he had already been in contact with
               Air Force Security from Fairchild in Spokane and they directed
               him to contact the WSU Police Department and keep the letter
               until they arrived. Ofc. Welter talked with Washburn about
               forwarding copies of the letter he had received and gave him
               his e-mail address so Washburn could e-mail him copies of the
               letter. Ofc. Welter and I tried to find any information about
               Thomas Glover on the Internet, but could not find anything. A
               check of Spillman and WSU's systems also showed nobody matching

               the name or information we had been given on Glover. Ofc.
               Welter later called Washburn back to see if he was able to make
               out the address for Glover that was on the piece of election
               mail because our photocopy was too blurry. Washburn said that
               he no longer had it because all of the information had been
               given to the FBI agent, who arrived a short time after we had
               left. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the
               laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 1st day of August, 2014, in Pullman,

               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W2737 SYNOPSIS: Third party report
               of a domestic dispute. I contacted the victim who did not wish
               to report anything. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 08/01/14 at about 2135 hrs Dispatch advised of a
               third party report of a domestic dispute. I contacted the
               victim, Brianna C. Johnson (101895), at 1420 NE Wheatland Dr.
               #12. Johnson told me she had an argument with her "baby's
               daddy" and did not want to report anything. Johnson said she
               only wanted me to go with her to her apartment so she could
               pick up some things. She said the male, later identified as
               Dominique M. Wright (081393), did not live at her apartment. I
               provided Johnson with a courtesy transport to her apartment,
               1401 NE Merman Dr. #704. As I was waiting for Johnson Dispatch
               advised she was the protected person in a no contact order with
               Wright. The order only restricts Wright from entering Johnson's
               apartment. Johnson confirmed the argument earlier was with
               Wright and that he was at the apartment but never said he
               entered the apartment. I provided Johnson with a transport back
               to the complainant's residence. Johnson said she was not aware
               of an order so I explained to her what the order was and what
               it covered. I provided Johnson with a DV victims packet.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 02 day of August, 2014, in
               Pullman, Washington. _______________________________________
