               approximately 2315 hours Ofc. Stewart and I responded to the
               are of Campus St and Veterans Way where an annonimous reporting
               party had found a passed out male. Upon arrival I found the
               male in between Thompson Hall and McKroskey Hall. The male was
               laying down on his back and breathing. The passerby said they
               were unable to wake the male. I walked up to the male, later
               identified as Quinton Dale Dickerson 10/27/95, and told him to
               wake up. As soon as I said that Dickerson opened his eyes and
               sat up. I asked Dickerson several questions to determine his
               mental status. Dickerson was not able to answer any of my
               questions correctly other than who the President of the United
               States was. Ofc. Stewart was able to get a very weak PBT sample
               of .187 from Dickerson. I again asked Dickerson my series of
               questions and this time he answered all the questions
               correctly. It was clear the Dickerson was very intoxicated.
               Once medics arrive they checked Dickerson out and determined he
               did not need to go to the hospital. I asked Dickerson if there
               was a sober person to watch him. Dickerson called several
               friends but none answered. I provided Dickerson a courtesy
               transport to his dorm Streit Hall. Once at his room 604,
               Dickerson discovered he had lost his key during his night
               activities. I had dispatch call the RA on duty for Streit Hall
               for a lockout. Two RA's responded and let Dickerson into his
               room. By the time Dickerson went into his room he was making
               sense and not as visibly intoxicated. Dickerson will be
               referred to student conduct. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               located in Rogers Hall room 939 along with the odor of
               marijuana. Both residents of the room decided to destroy the
               paraphernalia. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.

               Inderveer S. Basra (112994) Warned Possession of MJ and
               Paraphernalia NARRATIVE: On 081914 at approximately 0052 hours,
               I was dispatched to a faint odor of marijuana coming from room
               939 Rogers Hall. Upon arrival, I contacted Barjinder Sing who
               told me the following. He was out partying with some friends
               and returned to his room where his roommate Inderveer S. Basra
               was preparing to smoke marijuana. Singh told Basra to go to
               outside to smoke the marijuana. While talking to Singh, I
               noticed he had bloodshot watery eyes and smelled strongly of
               alcohol. I asked him how much he had to drink and he told me he
               was "wasted." Ofc. Boyd asked if he could go in his room and
               check on the male subject passed out on the floor of his room
               and he stated we could go in his room. Ofc. Boyd contacted the
               male who identified himself as Isaac. Ofc. Boyd woke up Isaac
               and made sure he didn't need medical attention. Isaac was able
               to answer all the questions Boyd asked him. Isaac laid back
               down on the floor and went back to sleep. While in the room, I
               noticed a glass smoking device on Basra's desk. I asked Singh
               whose bong was on the desk and he told me that it was both his
               and Basra's. I asked him to call Basra which he did. Singh put
               the phone on speaker and advised Basra that Ofc. Boyd and I
               were in his room for the odor of marijuana. I explained to
               Singh that it would be beneficial to him to destroy the bong on
               the desk, which he agreed. Singh asked Basra if he cared if he
               destroyed their bong, and Basra told him it was fine. Singh
               took the bong outside to the dumpster behind Rogers Hall and
               smashed it in the dumpster. I thanked Singh for his cooperation
               and cleared the call. Forward to WSU Student Standards and

               Burglary/Mal Misch 2. NARRATIVE: On 08/19/14 at about 0212 hrs
               Pullman PD was toned out to a disorderly subject in the area of
               610 NE Maiden Ln. The report was of a male at a nearby
               apartment banging on the door and yelling. He was last seen in
               the parking lot. Pullman PD requested an agency assist because
               they were all busy with a different incident. Officer Stewart
               and I responded. Upon our arrival we located a subjct, later
               identified as Christopher A. Jones (052093) in the parking lot
               at 630 NE Maiden Ln. I noticed Jones was looking at some
               material that was on the rear window of a vehicle and was
               burning. I contacted Jones while Officer Stewart put out the
               fire. Jones was quite intoxicated and was hard to communicate
               with. He denied starting the fire or causing any disturbance.
               He said he was just trying to walk back to his apartment. As we
               were talking with Jones a male came out of the apartment
               complex. I spoke to the male, Brayden R. Hadaller, who said
               Jones had been banging on his neighbors door and woke him up.
               He said his neighbor, later identified as Kaylene B. Kuykendall
               (062193), could not get out of her apartment because the door
               was broken. Kuykendall was able to go out on the deck that
               joins her apartment to Hadaller's and get out through his
               apartment. Kuykendall said she knows Jones and he came to her
               apartment because he wanted to sleep on the couch but she did
               not want him inside because he was too drunk. She refused to
               let him in and he began pounding on the door. Kuykendall said
               Jones was pounding on the door for quite a while and damaged
               the frame. I checked the door and found the door frame was
               broken as well as part of the internal door handle mechanism. I
               assisted Kuykendall in removing part of the mechanism so she
               could open the door to her apartment. Kuykendall said she was
               not scared by Jones and did not feel threatened in any way she
               just didn't want to let him in because he was drunk. She did
               not want him charged with any crimes even though he damaged the
               door. After speaking with Kuykendall I was able to locate the
               owner of the vehicle (AKA7572) which had the burning items on
               it. The owner Brierra M. Winfrey (021293) came out and I showed
               her what happened. I did not believe there was any damage as
               the burnt material was contained to the rear window of the
               vehicle. I told her I thought it would all clean off but

               and not to cause any further disturbances. Nothing further. I

               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Dominique M. Wright (081393) Warned
               Order Violation 2. NARRATIVE: On 081914 at approximately 0249
               hours, I was dispatched to an order violation report. Upon
               arrival, Ofc. Boyd contacted the RP, Brianna C. Johnson, and I
               contacted Dominique M. Wright. Johnson told Boyd that Wright
               attempted to call her twice and she didn't answer. Then he came
               to her residence and knocked on her door. She also didn't
               answer her door. Wright told me that he needed two shirts for
               work that were in Johnson's apartment. Wright stated that he
               never spoke with Johnson and he never set foot in her
               apartment. Ofc. Boyd checked the order while I was speaking
               with Wright and determined that Wright was restricted from
               being inside Johnson's apartment and that his only
               communication with her via phone or text was to discuss
               arangements to transfer their child in common. I explained to
               Wright that he was not to contact Johnson for any reason other
               than to arrange a meeting to exchange their child. I also
               explained that he was not allowed to be in her apartment which
               he stated he wasn't. I asked him how his shirts got in her
               apartment and he stated that several weeks ago, he visited his
               son in the apartment and Johnson didn't have a problem with it
               then. He stated he accidentally left his work shirts there
               because he came from work that day. I explained to him that he
               is only setting himself up for getting arrested if he goes into
               her apartment and strongly encouraged him to follow the order
               so he didn't get in trouble. Wright told me he understood. I
               told him he was free to leave and he walked back to his
               friend's house. Ofc. Boyd returned to Johnson and explained
               that the protection order only prevents him from being inside
               her residence. He suggested to her that if she wants it to be
               broader, she needs to seek an amendment to the order by going
               to Whitman County District Court. Nothing further. I certify
