    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Olmstead/339 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W2740 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched to a
               burglary alarm at the Washington Building. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 08-02-2014 at about
               1514 hrs I was dispatched to a burglary alarm at the Washington
               Building, located at 1125 SE Washington Street. Dispatch
               advised that the alarm had originated from the 1st floor main
               entry door. I arrived on scene and observed a black, 1999 Acura
               sedan (WA Lic. AMM9097) in the parking lot. I contacted the
               driver of the vehicle, who was identified as Korey J. Payne
               (DOB 12-16-1987). Payne told me that he had walked into the WSU
               Health and Wellness Clinic through the unlocked front doors.
               Payne said he saw that the lights were off and realized the
               clinic was closed. Payne said he heard an audible alarm, so he
               turned around and exited the building. Officer Welter arrived
               on scene and checked the interior of the building. Officer
               Welter determined that the building was unoccupied and nothing
               appeared to be out of the ordinary. Payne was released, the
               building was secured, and the alarm was reset. Officer Welter
               and I cleared the scene. No further action at this time.
               Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this __03__ day of ___August___,
               2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               while his keys were on the backseat of the car. Using the big
               easy tool, I was able to hook the keys on the seat and pull
               them out the window. Once Winter had his keys back I cleared.
