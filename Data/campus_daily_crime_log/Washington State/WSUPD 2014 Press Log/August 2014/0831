               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W3198 08/31/14 SYNOPSIS: Noise complaint
               over noise at WSU Women's Soccer Game. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On August 31, 2014 at about 1114
               hours Pullman Police were dispatched to a noise complaint in
               the general Greek Row area. Pullman Police Officer Harris
               determined the noise was coming from the WSU Women's Soccer
               Game. At about 1130 hours I was advised by Officer Harris of
               the complaint. Pullman Police did not have a noise variance for
               the event. The WSU Women's Soccer field was recently renovated.
               This included a new sound system and scoreboard. Both the sound
               system and scoreboard are in a new location on the west side of
               the field. The sound system projects towards the east. I
               contacted Greg Testa, WSU Event Management on site at the
               field. He told me that the sound system was pretty loud just
               before the game began. They will be playing music at halftime.
               He said the music will be turned down. While I was on scene
               there was no amplified noise. Just the noise of the players
               playing soccer and the occasional crowd noise. I advised Testa
               of the City of Pullman noise ordinance, Chapter 8.80, and the
               need for variances at these types of events. He said he will
               pass the information on to his supervisor on Tuesday. Warning
               and education provided. No infractions issued. No further
               investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 31st day of August, 2014, in
               Pullman, Washington. _______________________________________

               regarding WSU vans poor forest road parking and trail head
               etiquette on Moscow Mountain. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On August 31, 2014 at about 1455
               hours I was dispatched to a subject who wanted to make a
               general complaint against an unknown WSU department regarding
               poor behavior observed on Moscow Mountain. I called the
               complainant, RHODES, Tobyn N. (05/24/78). He told me he was at
               the "4 Corners" area on Moscow Mountain today, August 31, 2014
               at about noon. Rhodes saw two (2) white WSU vans at this
               location. He said the vehicles had markings on them indicating
               they belonged to WSU. Rhodes was not able to provide a license
               plate number or van number. Rhodes complained that the vans
               were blocking the parking area as well as the forest roadway.
               He was not able to drive into the parking area due to what he
               called "poor forest road and trail head etiquette." He said
               there were people running on the trail and one male standing by
               the cooler. He also saw a table set up at the trail head with a
               large Powerade beverage cooler on it. Rhodes had to go park
               elsewhere down the road. When he returned to the area to access
               the trail he saw litter on the ground including red cups, juice
               box straws, and ibuprofen wrappers. It is unknown if the litter
               was left behind by the WSU group. Rhodes did not make contact
               with the group. He does not know who they are. His concern was
               the van parking and litter. Rhodes kept emphasizing the land is
               private property and could be closed to the public. Rhodes
               wants the responsible WSU department informed of his complaint.
               It is unknown who the group was on Moscow Mountain. I checked
               with WSU ORC and SRC. The ORC was closed and had no trips. The
               SRC did not have any trips either. I called Bill Stevens,
               Associate Athletic Director, Communications. I told him about
               the complaint. He was not aware of any WSU Athletic groups in
               that area. Stevens asked for an email and he will look into the
               issue on Tuesday, September 2, 2014. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               31st day of August, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W3203 SYNOPSIS: Krystyne D. Gutscher (DOB
               08-12-1970) reported a suspicious male at the Veterinary
               Teaching Hospital. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 08-31-2014 at about 1918 hrs I was dispatched to
               a report of a suspicious male at the Veterinary Teaching
               Hospital, located at 200 SE Ott Road. Dispatch advised that the
               complainant, Krystyne D. Gutscher (DOB 08-12-1970), wished to
               report an incident that occurred about an hour ago. I contacted
               Gutscher on the telephone. Gutscher is the receptionist at the
               main entrance of the Veterinary Teaching Hospital. Gutscher
               said on 08-31-2014 at about 1830 hrs a male entered the
               hospital and contacted her at the reception counter. Gutscher
               described the male as being aggressive and high strung.
               Gutscher told me that the male was leaning over the counter
               towards her and insisted on seeing "Tania Perez". Gutscher said
               the male repeatedly stated "where is she, I need to talk to
               her, where is she". Gutscher said the male was holding a
               cellular telephone in his hand and kept showing it to her.
               Gutscher said she could see the screen on the telephone and
               thought is said something like, "Tania Perez shared a link".
               Gutscher was not sure if this was a Facebook page or some other
               social networking site. Gutscher told the male that Perez was
               not working at this time, but the male was insistent that Perez
               was in the building. Gutscher called around the building
               attempting to find Perez, but did not find her. Gutscher again
               told the male that Perez was not working, and the male walked
               out the main entrance and left the building. Gutscher told me
               that there actually is an employee, later identified as Tania
               E. Perez (DOB 04-11-1975), who works at the hospital as an
               anesthetist, but she was not working at the time of this
               incident. After the male left, Gutscher called Perez on the
               telephone and advised her of the situation. Perez told Gutscher
               that she was home and had no idea who the male might be.
               Gutscher said she reported the incident to her supervisor and
               was told to call the police department. Gutscher identified her
               supervisor as Doug Blake, 509-335-0825. Gutscher said Blake
               will return to work on 09-02-2014 and will check the video
               surveillance system for any footage of the suspicious male.
               Gutscher described the suspicious male as: Hispanic male; 35 to
               45 years old; 5-08; 165 to 170 lbs.; stocky build; brown hair
               that was short on the sides, longer on the top, and gelled and
               parted to one side; no facial hair; heavy accent; blue and
               white "gangnam style" t-shirt; jeans. I concluded my

               conversation with Gutscher, and at about 2000 hrs I contacted
               Perez on the telephone. I explained the situation to Perez and
               asked her if she might know the suspicious male. Perez said she
               had no idea who the male might be and did not know why he was
               asking for her at the hospital. Perez said she has not
               conducted any recent online or Facebook activity. Perez said
               she checked her Facebook account and has not received any
               messages or strange contacts from anyone. Perez said she lives
               alone with her teenage son. Perez said her name and photograph
               is displayed on the Veterinary Teaching Hospital website, and
               it could be possible that someone saw her information there. I
               told Perez to contact me immediately if she determined who the
               suspicious male was. I advised Perez to take the appropriate
               steps to ensure her personal safety and to report anything
               suspicious immediately to the police department. I told Perez
               that video surveillance of the male might be available later
               this week, and I would contact her if this became available. I
               concluded my conversation with Perez. not finished............

               responded. I confirmed there was a faint odor of marijuana
               coming from room 423. We knocked on the door several times but
               there was no answer. It appeared no one was home. I left a note
               requesting the residents of the room call me. Nothing further.
               I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws
               of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 02 day of September, 2014, in Pullman,

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W3207 SYNOPSIS: Report of an intoxicated
               female in room 1039 Rogers Hall. It was determined she was not
               in need of medical attention and medics were cancelled due to
               high call volume. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               Mckenzie T. Kendle/022196 2. NARRATIVE: On 09/01/14 at about
               0149 hrs dispatch advised of a female who was highly
               intoxicated and vomiting in room 1039 Rogers Hall. Officer
               Stewart and I responded. We located the female, Mckenzie T.
               Kendle, laying on the floor in the room. She had been vomiting
               prior to our arrival and was quite intoxicated. Kendle was able
               to answer all of our questions correctly and was coherent in
               her responses. A resident of the room, Nicholas A. Towery, was
               sober and said he was sent to pick up Kendle from a party. He
               was willing to keep an eye on her over night. There were
               several other ambulance calls being dispatched at the time so I
               had the ambulance response for Kendle cancelled because she was
               able to speak with us and had someone sober to keep watch over
               her. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 01 day of September,

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: KDS/326 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W3208 SYNOPSIS: Toshua S. Hickmann
               reported his silver 1996 Accura Integra WA/485XGW has been
               stolen from the Blue 1 parking lot behind Rogers Hall. Hickmann
               told me his vehicle had red fenders, a red front bumper and a
               black hood. Vehicle has been entered into NCIC. No suspects or
               leads. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               090114 at approximately 0142 hours, I was dispatched to a
               report of an auto theft report at the Stephenson Complex. Upon
               arrival, I contacted Toshua S. Hickmann who told me the
               following. On 082914, he parked his silver 1996 Accura Integra
               in the blue 1 parking lot behind the Orton Hall in the second
               tier down. I asked Hickmann to ride to the parking lot and show
               me where he parked his car. He took me to the parking lot and
               showed me the stall he parked in. On the ground, I found
               several small pieces of glass that were consistent with a
               vehicle's broken window. Hickmann told me that his vehicle is
               silver with red fenders, a red front bumper, and a black hood.
               He also stated that both sets of keys were in his residence and
               he didn't loan his car to anyone. I asked Hickmann when the
               last time he knew that his vehicle had been seen. He told me
               that a friend of his saw his vehicle at 1600 hours on Saturday
               August 30th, 2014. Hickmann told me he has no idea who may have
               taken his vehicle. Hickmann signed the stolen paperwork and I
               took it to Whitcom for NCIC entry. I also asked Whitcom to send
               out an ATL to all local agencies advising them of the stolen
               vehicle and description which they did. Ofc. Boyd checked the
               blue 1 parking lot for Hickmann's vehicle with negative
               results. I chekced Kelley Blue Book for the vehicle's value
               which showed a value of $895.00 for a 1996 Acura Integra in
               fair condition. Case inactive pending further investigative
               leads. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the
               laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 1st day of September, 2014, in Pullman,
