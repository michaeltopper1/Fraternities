               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W2772 SYNOPSIS: RP found a mini lunch box
               cooler on the side of the road by Chief Joseph and Terrace
               Apartments on Merman Drive. Cpl. Daniels contacted Sgt.
               Opgenorth from PPD and advised him that property was found in
               their jurisdiction and he asked for us to take care of it.
               Unable to find the owner at the moment. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 08-06-14 at approximately 0920
               hrs. Cpl. Daniels and I were dispatched to the front office
               about some property being found. When we headed downstairs to
               talk with the RP he was gone, but he left the property he found
               along with his contact information. I tried contacting the RP
               Robert W. Losh (DOB 07-03-64) via phone at approximately 0927
               hrs, but was unable to reach him. Losh returned my phone call
               at approximately 1000 hrs. I asked him where he found the grey
               and red mini lunch box cooler and he told me that he found it
               near the road and sidewalk next to the Chief Joseph and Terrace
               Apartments. I asked Losh if he found it on Merman Drive and he
               said he was unsure of the street name, but if that's the road
               between Chief Joseph and Terrace Apartments then it was the
               correct street. Losh told me that he found the lunch box
               between 0850 and 0855 hrs. on the morning of 08-06-14 and then
               brought it to us at the department. I thanked Losh for turning
               in the property and told him hopefully we will be able find the
               owner. After discovering that the property was found in PPD's
               jurisdiction, Cpl. Daniels contacted Sgt. Opgenorth from PPD
               and advised him that RP brought us property that was found in
               their jurisdiction and he asked us to take care of it for them.
               The mini lunch box is grey and red in color and the brand is
               Ozark Trail. Inside of the lunch box contained: three chocolate
               protein shakes, a Smith & Wesson nylon gun case, a full S&W
               magazine of .380 ammo, an open bottle of vitamins, an open can
               of Copenhagen Wintergreen pouches, two eyeglass wipes, a
               Walmart receipt and two pages with handwritten information on
               it. On one of the pages included a name of Donna L. Bragg (DOB
               08-23-44), a social security number and a Pomeroy, WA address.
               Cpl. Daniels and I tried searching for Donna Bragg in local
               systems in case she might be the owner, but Donna Bragg is
               deceased. We found two other people that live in Pomeroy, WA
               with the last name of Bragg, David and Peggy. I tried
               contacting them via phone, but all of the numbers listed have
               been disconnected except for one of David's, so I left him a
               voicemail. The property has been placed into the WSUPD evidence
               room. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the
