    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Tiengo/321 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W2761 SYNOPSIS: Ofc. Olmstead and I were
               dispatched to a burglary in Fulmer Hall. RP stated that there
               was damage to the door of room 174 from what may have been a
               crowbar. RP not sure if entry was ever made and nothing
               appeared to be missing. There are no suspects or leads at this
               time. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               08-05-2014 at about 0820 hrs Ofc. Olmstead and I were
               dispatched to a report of a burglary in Fulmer Hall, located at
               1320 NE College Avenue. Ofc. Olmstead and I arrived at Fulmer
               Hall room 305 and met with the RP Trent B. Amonett (DOB 04-20-
               65), who is the Assistant Director for the Department of
               Chemistry. Amonett told us he received an e-mail from one of
               his grad students reporting that it appeared room 174 of Fulmer
               Hall had been pried opened with a crowbar or something like it.
               Amonett said nothing appeared to be missing at the moment and
               they are unsure if entry was actually gained into the room.
               Ofc. Olmstead asked him what type of room it is and Amonett
               told us it's a Wet Lab for Organic Chemistry. Amonett told us
               that he is unsure of exactly when the damaged occurred, but he
               would guess it happened about three weeks ago; so between 07-
               15-14 at approximately 0800 hrs and 08-05-14 at approximately
               0800 hrs. Amonett mentioned a lot of weird things have been
               going in Fulmer Hall for the past year, such as thefts or
               individuals inside that do not belong in the building. Amonett
               mentioned that sometimes doors are being propped open with
               rocks being stuffed into door jambs so it appears the door is
               shut, but it's not and now the building becomes unsecured. Ofc.
               Olmstead told Amonett that he would send out an e-mail to the
               rest of the department for extra patrols around Fulmer Hall
               during the night. Amonett took Ofc. Olmstead and I down to room
               174 to show us the damage. There were several pry marks on the
               door frame and latch plate. The metal door frame and latch
               plate were dented and scratched, and the surface of the wooden
               door was chipped. The damage is estimated to be $350.00.
               Amonett said he has already submitted a work request to WSU
               Facilities Operations to get the door fixed. Ofc. Olmstead
               photographed the damaged door, and the photographs were
               downloaded into Spillman. I sent out an e-mail to the rest of
               the department requesting extra foot patrols around Fulmer
               after hours. There are no suspects or leads at this time. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 5th day of August, 2014, in Pullman,

               Department with a Domestic Dispute NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 07-06-14 Pullman PD requested
               an officer to assist with a domestic dispute at the
               intersection of Fountaine and Shirley. I responded to the area
               and contacted officers Lambley and Chamberlin. Lambley
               requested I help Chamberlin watch a male, later identified as
               Clark Proctor. Clark was very intoxicated. There was a strong
               odor of intoxicating beverages coming from his breath and his
               speech was slurred. Proctor was handcuffed behind his back.
               When I got there he was sitting on a rock wall next to the
               sidewalk. While ranting about the situation he would stand up
               and Chamberlin would tell him to sit down. As time Proctor
               became more agitated. We tried to get him to calm down, but was
               unsuccessful. He eventually said I am done. Arrest me or let me
               go. I told him several times that as soon as Officer Lambley
               was done interviewing the witness' he would know what was going
               on. This upset him. He said "Well fuck it I want a drink of
               water." he stood up and tried to walk into his residence.
               Chamberlin and I grabbed him. I was on his right and Chamberlin
               on his left. As soon as we grabbed him he tensed up, tried to
               squirm out of my grip, and began to scream. I told him several
               times to be quit screaming and relax. He refused so we decided
               that for our safety it would be better to have Proctor lie face
               down on the ground. I applied a gooseneck and forced him to his
               knees then to lie flat on the ground. This seemed to calm him
               and he quit ranting and moving around. Officer Lambley came
               over a short time later and told Proctor he was under arrest
               for malicious mischief. Chamberlin and I stood Proctor up and
               walked him to Chamberlin's patrol vehicle. He was then
               transported to Pullman PD's Holding Facility. I cleared with
               out incident. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 6th day of August, 2014, in
