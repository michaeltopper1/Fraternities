        Incident Address : 1622 NE Colorado St; Streit Perham Cente
                           PULLMAN              WA 99163

        Time Reported: 07:17
    Time Occurred between: 07:15:25 08/16/14 - 07:15:25 08/16/14

    Narrative: RVWD:BEJ/314 OFC: ENW/328 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W2870 SYNOPSIS: Request to contact the
               owner of a vehicle parked in the Streit/Perham key and ask them
               to move their vehicle. We were unable to contact the owner.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 081614
               around 0717 hrs I was dispatched to a report of a vehicle
               parked in the Streit/Perham Key. The key was supposed to be
               clear of vehicles to facilitate with the move in of new
               students. I contacted Chris Boyan of WSU Parking and
               Transportation and he asked me to contact the owner. He went on
               to tell me they had no record of the vehicle in their system
               and I told him I would see what I could do. I looked up the
               vehicle, Wa. AND9762, and registered owner, Kari bittner, up in
               DAPS and later attempted to find the owner in WSU's system. WSU
               had no record in their system and I contacted the Orting Police
               Department in an attempt to find a contact number. The Orting
               Police Department told me they would have to get back to me
               with the information. I later contacted Boyan about what I had
               been told and he told me that would be fine before I contacted
               Whitcom and cleared the call. As of 1000 hrs I have not heard
               back from the Orting Police Department, or Boyan regarding the
               vehicle being a problem. I recommend this case be closed.
               Nothing further at this time. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 16th day of
               August, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               questions about a collections bill he received. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 08/16/14 at
               approximately 2033 hours I was dispatched to a civil call
               regarding issues with Team Mobile cell phone company. I
               contacted Osama M. Fakron 08/30/74 who was in the Pullman
               Police Department lobby. When I Fakron he provided the
               following story: Fakron had a cell phone plan through Team
               Mobile but is leaving the country in a few weeks. Fakron
               canceled his cell phone plan and received a bill of $119
               dollars a few weeks later. Fakron said he did not believe he
               was responsible for the $119 dollars. Fakron drove to Spokane
               to speak with Team Mobile. Fakron spoke to "Adam" who was able
               to reduce Fakron's bill to $16 dollars. Fakron still believed
               he did not have to pay $16 dollars but since Adam was so nice
               Fakron paid the balance. Fakron said he paid the $16 dollars on
               08/12/14 and his account showed $0 dollars. Fakron stated that
               he received a collection agency bill on 08/16/14 for $119
               dollars. Fakron said he was upset because he thought the
               collection agency was trying to cheat him out of money. I
               looked at the collection agency bill and it was dated 08/13/14.
               I explained to Fakron that what happened most likely was that
               the collection agency had not received the information that he
               had paid off his account the day before. Fakron said that made
               sense. I urged Fakron to call Team Mobile and have them contact
               the collection agency about the outstanding balance. Fakron
               said he would do that tomorrow. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               Kathryn S. Iverson Unlocked Apartment 2. NARRATIVE: On 08-16-
               14, at approximately 2315 hours, I responded to the Nez Perce
               Village Apartments, near apartment G 24, for a lockout. Upon my
               arrival I contacted Shannon K. Hill (07-26-68). Hill said she
               had helped Kathryn S. Iverson (07-22-94) move to Pullman so she
               could attend school. Iverson said she had not been issued keys
               to her apartment (G 24) yet, but had met with her roommate
               earlier in the day. She said her roommate gave her a key to the
               apartment because she was going to Spokane for the evening with
               her boy friend. Iverson said she had already tried calling the
               Nez Perce Village Apartment Coordinator and received a voice
               recording stating they were out of town. Iverson said there was
               a phone number left on the voice recording to call in case of
               an emergency which was disconnected. I called Robert
               Tattershall, the Director of WSU Housing and Conference
               Services, to see if he could help me figure out if Iverson was
               actually on the lease for apartment G24 at the Nez Perce
               Village Apartments. Tattershall verified she was; in fact, on
               the lease and said I was authorized to let her into the
               apartment. I did so and cleared. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               Arrested Making False Statements CITE/SECTOR# 4Z0804734
               NARRATIVE: On 08/16/14 at approximately 2327 hours I was
               driving westbound on Colorado near Northside Hall when a black
               Honda Ridgeline pickup pulled out in front of me heading
               westbound. The truck had approximately 6 males in the back of
               the bed and a few were sitting up on the bed rails. When the
               truck turned onto Colorado it started to quickly accelerate
               past the posted 20 MPH speed limit. I paced the truck as it
               accelerated to approximately 30 MPH. I could hear someone in
               the back of the truck yell to the driver to slow down because
               there was a cop behind him. When the truck hit 30 MPH I
               activated my emergency lights. The truck pulled over and came
               to a stop at Colorado St and the Soccer Field. As I was walking
               up to the truck I noticed the inside of the cab was also full
               of males. I contacted the driver, Zaire Chance Andre 08/14/96,
               identified myself, informed him I was recording, and explained
               the reason for the stop. I asked Andre if he had his driver's
               license with him and he said yes. Andre felt around his pockets
               and then said he did not know where it was. Andre handed me his
               WSU cougar card. Andre said he grabbed the wrong card (ID
               card). While standing at the driver's side window I could smell
               the overpowering odor of intoxicants coming from the car. I
               asked Andre if he had any alcohol to drink tonight and he said
               no. I asked Andre if I could check his eyes. Andre said I
               could. I performed an HGN test on Andre as he sat in his car.
               During the test I did not see any signs of HGN but could smell
               the odor of intoxicants coming from his breath. I asked Andre
               if he was willing to provide a PBT sample to prove he had no
               alcohol in his system. Andre said he would. I found my PBT,
               Alco-Sensor FST (#16805) in working condition. I explained to
               Andre how to properly provide a sample. When I told Andre to
               provide his sample Andre was not blowing out or putting his
               lips around the breath tube. I again told him how to properly
               provide a sample and Andre tried again. This time Andre was not
               blowing outward instead just sitting there with his lips on the
               breath tube. It was clear that Andre was purposefully trying
               not to provide a breath sample. I again told Andre what to do
               and I had to manually click the PBT after less than a second to
               get a sample. Andre provided a PBT sample of .020. Based on my
               training and experience when someone only provides a weak

               sample of one second, their BAC is much higher than shown. I
               would have estimated Andre at approximately .040 BAC. I asked
               Andre to speak with me outside the truck. Once outside of the
               truck I told Andre that I could clearly smell the odor of
               intoxicants coming from his breath even as he was now away from
               the group. Andre said he had not been drinking but had been
               around others that had and that's why he smells like alcohol. I
               asked Andre if he was willing to perform some voluntary field
               sobriety tests. Andre said he would. After the SFST's it was my
               determination that Andre was right around the .020 BAC limit
               for minors. I had Andre do another PBT where he again was not
               providing a proper PBT sample. I was able to obtain a weak
               sample of .010. I told Andre that I was not charging him with
               DUI or MIP tonight. However he would be referred to student
               conduct. I asked Andre if he was a student athlete since he was
               hanging out with WSU football players. Andre said he was not a
               football player and not associated with WSU athletics. I asked
               Andre to provided his information verbally since he did not
               have his driver's license on him. I asked Andre to spell his
               last name. Andre verbally told me it was spelt, "A N D R E S."
               Andre spelled his first name, "Z A I R E A." Andre said his
               middle name was "Champion." When I asked Andre for his date of
               birth he provided, "08/15/96." Andre said he had a California
               Driver's License. I ran Andre through dispatch and they stated
               there was no return for him through California. I asked Andre
               why I would would not be getting a return for the name he
               provided. Andre said he did not know. I asked Andre to spell
               his last name again. Andre spelled his last named, "Andres"
               again. I asked Andre to spell his first name and he said it was
               "Zarea." I said I had Zairea and Andre said yes that was right.
               I asked Andre if his date of birth was 08/15/96 and he said
               yes. I looked at Andre's WSU cougar card that he provided. On
               the WSU cougar card was printed the name of "Zaire Chance
               Andre." I told Andre that his WSU cougar card had his name
               spelled differently. Andre said that the people at the cougar
               card place had cut off his name and he had already talked to
               them to correct it. I told Andre to sit in the backseat of my
               patrol car until I could confirm his identity. Using Zzusis I
               was able to find Andre's correct information. I had dispatch
               run Andre's correct information and obtained a current
               California Driver's Return for Andre. I had Andre exit the
               patrol car and I told him he was under arrest for making false
               statements to a public servant. I handcuffed (D/L) Andre and
               searched him incident to arrest. No weapons or illegal items
               were found. Andre was placed back into the backseat of my
               patrol car. I contacted Albert Connor Simpson 12/04/95 who the
               truck belonged to. I told Simpson it was not a good idea to let
               someone who had been drinking to drive his car. I also told
               Simpson that there was an unopened bud light can in the back of
               his truck. I had Simpson pour it out and throw the can out.
               There were a few WSU football players still around the truck
               and I asked if anybody was completely sober and not had any
               alcohol. Kevin T Griffin 06/07/96 said he had not drank.
               Griffin was the only one who was had not been drinking. Griffin
               drove the car back to Northside Hall. I transported Andre to

               the Pullman Holding Facility where he was fingerprinted and

               9A.76.175 Making False or Misleading Statements to a Public
               Servant. I explained the citation and provided Andre with his
               copy. Prior to Andre's release I spoke with Antonio Huffman who
               is a WSU football coach. I explained the situation to Huffman
               and Huffman stated he would be at the Holding Facility to pick
               Andre up. I released Andre into Huffman's care and cleared.

               hrs I was driving southbound on Stadium Way approaching
               Colorado St. when I heard a loud explosion and could see what
               appeared to be like a firework going off on the access road to
               the parking lot behind Streit/Perham. I could see a group of
               males who jumped back and ran across Stadium Way. I contacted
               the males, later identified as Holden V. Roberts (100495),
               Thomas L. Krahn (020196), Blake T. Ozuna (050796), and Michael
               J. Peters (090895). They told me they were walking in the area
               when they saw two other males who they did not know yelling at
               some females on the 2nd or 3rd floor of Perham Hall. The males
               lit a firework and they all went over to see it go off but were
               surprised by how large the explosion was so they jumped back
               and ran across the street. They thought the two who lit the
               firework ran behind Perham Hall. I checked the area but saw no
               one else around. Nothing further. I certify and declare under

               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 17 day of

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W2898 SYNOPSIS: Report of possible gun
               shots heard from Steptoe Apartments. Pullman PD reported
               hearing/seeing fireworks shortly before the report was made and
               was likely the sound heard by the reporting party. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 08/17/14 at
               about 0214 hrs Dispatch advised of a subject reporting hearing
               what sounded like a single gunshot approximately 10 minutes
               prior. They said they also heard the same sound about an hour
               before that. I knew Pullman PD officers reported hearing/seeing
               fireworks going off about 10 minutes prior to the report. In
               addition, I saw several subjects set off a large firework about
               the time the complainant heard the sounds the first time. I
               checked the area around Steptoe Village and determined the
               sound heard by the complainant was likely the fireworks
               seen/heard by various police officers. I called the complainant
               and left a message telling them of the firework activity going
               on. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 17 day of August,

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W2899 SYNOPSIS: Report of people talking
               loudly outside apartment 704 of Terrace Apartments. Resident
               contacted and warned for noise. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE

               Complaint 2. NARRATIVE: On 08/17/14 at about 0236 hrs Dispatch
               advised of multiple complaints regarding people talking and
               yelling loudly outside apartment 704 of Terrace Apartments. I
               responded and confirmed there were several groups of people
               standing outside apartment 704 as well as in a nearby parking
               lot. They were all being rather loud and would reasonably be
               upsetting people trying to sleep in nearby apartments. I
               contacted the resident of apartment 704 who I recognized as
               Brianna C. Johnson from previous contacts at her apartment. I
               warned Johnson for the noise and advised her to get the people
               she had at her apartment to quiet down. I told her if I had to
               return I would issue her an infraction for the noise. Johnson
               began walking around and telling people to move inside and be
               quiet. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 17 day of August,
               2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W2900 SYNOPSIS: Infraction issued to
               resident for noise violation. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Brianna C. Johnson/101895 Infraction issued
               Noise 4Z0810100 2. NARRATIVE: On 08/17/14 at about 0431 hrs
               Dispatch advised of a noise complaint regarding loud talking
               coming from Terrace Apartments 704. Several hours earlier I had
               been dispatched to the same apartment for a similar noise
               complaint and warned the resident, Brianna C. Johnson. I
               responded and as I exited my car I could hear loud talking,
               laughing, and music coming from Johnson's apartment. I was
               approximately 40 yards from the apartment and could hear the
               noise. Officer Kirshner said he could hear the noise from the
               other side of the building as well. I issued Johnson an
               infraction for violation of the Pullman City Code (PCC
               8.80.020). I contacted Johnson at her residence and told her we
               received another complaint about the noise. I told her I could
               hear the noise from a good distance away and did not think the
               amount of noise they were making was reasonable. I explained to
               her the city code regarding noise between the hours of 10pm and
               7am. I explained the infraction to her and she received her
               copy. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 17 day of August,
               2014, in Pullman, Washington.
