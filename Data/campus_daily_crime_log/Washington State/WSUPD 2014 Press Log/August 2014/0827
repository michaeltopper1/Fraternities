    Narrative: RVWD:BEJ/314 OFC: ENW/328 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W3107 SYNOPSIS: Report of a possible
               transient who had been in McCoy Hall sometime between 0530 hrs
               on 082514 and 0800 hrs on 082714. The subject was gone upon
               arrival. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 082714 around 0813 hrs I was dispatched to a report of a
               possible vagrant sleeping in the lobby of McCoy Hall. I
               contacted the reporting party, later identified as Charles E
               Powell (030156), who told me the following. Powell explained
               someone had been sleeping in the lobby area of McCoy Hall over
               the weekend and some trash, to include cigarettes, were left in
               the lobby area. I told Powell I would come down and walk
               through the building and make sure to pass along the
               information along to Cougar Security as well as Patrol. While I
               was walking through McCoy Hall I spoke with an individual,
               later identified as Eric M Lautzenheiser (031677), who told me
               he had seen an individual sleeping in the lobby on 082514. When
               I asked him to describe the individual he could not describe
               them due to a pullover hood being worn. He did add that he saw
               what he described as a pull behind suitcase near the
               individual. I asked why he hadn't contacted us or spoken with
               the individual. He explained he believed it may have been a
               student that hadn't had a chance to get into their apartment
               yet and didn't think about it possibly being a transient at the
               time. I told him if he were to see the individual in the
               building again to give us a call and was told he would. I was
               not able to locate the subject during the remainder of my time
               in McCoy Hall and cleared a short time later. Nothing further.
               I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws
               of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 27th day of August, 2014, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer

               information and a ride. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR#
               1.Adriana R. Picchioni 06/14/96 2. NARRATIVE: On 08/27/14 at
               approximately 1100 hours I responded to the front desk to
               answer questions for a subject, identified as Adriana R.
               Picchioni. Picchioni explained that she had borrowed her
               friend's (Darby) car this morning. Picchioni said she realized
               that she lost Darby's keys between the time she parked the
               vehicle and got out of class. Picchioni said she went to the
               CUB lost and found and retrieved a set of keys that looked just
               like Darby's, except they had a lanyard attached. Picchioni
               said the CUB staff told her the keys were just turned in 5
               minutes prior so she thought they were the correct keys.
               Picchioni asked if I could provide her a ride to the car since
               it was parked somewhere on Greek Row and check if they were the
               correct keys. I told her I could do that. I asked Picchioni if
               she wanted a case started for the lost keys and she said she
               did not. I provided Picchioni a ride to Garfield St. where we
               located the car. Picchioni tried the keys, but they were not
               the correct ones. I provided Picchioni a ride back to her
               residence hall (Duncan Dunn) and asked if there was anything
               else I could do to help and she said there wasn't. I returned
               the keys to the CUB info desk and advised the subject the keys
               did not belong to the subject that picked them up. I did not
               identify the subject, but he said he was the one who gave them
               out so he was familiar with them. Case created to document
               citizen assist, not lost property. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 27th day of

               white board had been wiped so that it was unreadable. Kyle
               showed me a picture he had taken of the white board on his

               I'm always welcome, I suck cock, Justin is a vagina, (a symbol
               of a penis), and Ciara Loves you both". Kyle told me the
               residents of the room were not bothered by the writing and it
               was unknown who Megan and Justin are. The residents were not
               home at this time. Kyle stated he would not have bothered
               reporting this to the Police except by their policy when
               certain things are written/drawn, in this case the symbol of
               the penis, they are required to report it. Situation will be

               MIP-Exhibiting 2. NARRATIVE: On 082814 at approximately 0254
               hours, I was talking to some interns in the parking lot of the
               WSU Police Department when a highly intoxicated male went
               walking within approximately 10 feet of us. He was having a
               hard time walking in a straight line and was staggering
               heavily. I asked where he was heading and he told me he was
               going to Olympia Hall. I asked him if I could talk to him and
               he walked over to me. I asked him his name and he told me his
               name was Jared A. Gill. I asked him how much he had to drink
               and he told me that he had several drinks. I asked him where he
               thought Olympia Hall was and he pointed north toward the CUB. I
               asked him if he knew where the CUB was and he pointed toward
               the WSU Football Stadium. I asked if he would be willing to
               provide a PBT sample of his breath and he told me he would.
               Gill provided a sample of .174. His speech was heavily slurred,
               his eyes were bloodshot and watery and he smelled strongly of
               intoxicants. I explained to Gill that I was going to send his
               information to WSU Student Conduct for disciplinary action and
               he told me that was fine. I explained to Gill how to get to his
               residence hall and he told me he understood. I directed him to
               go down Stadium Way toward Gannon Hall and he told me he could
               get there from Gannon Hall. I cleared shortly after. Forward to
               WSU Student Conduct. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 28th day of August,
