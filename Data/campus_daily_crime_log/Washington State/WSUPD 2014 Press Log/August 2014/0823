    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: DMJ/338 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W3023 08/23/14 SYNOPSIS: Report of a
               broken door lock on 3rd floor of Morrill Hall. No damage found,
               appears to just need some routine maintenance. No crime(s)
               committed. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On August 23, 2014 at about 0903 hours I was
               dispatched to the third floor of Morrill Hall for a report of a
               broken interior door lock. I responded to the 3rd floor of
               Morrill Hall. The 3rd floor hallway is locked on both the north
               and south access stairwells. I was able to easily key into the
               north side. I keyed into the south door with some difficulty. I
               was able to manipulate the lock, but it did not turn as easily
               as it should. There are no signs of vandalism or malicious
               mischief. It appears that the door lock just needs some routine
               maintenance. The lock still operates and secures the hallway.
               The CAD comments show that WSU Facilities Operations have
               already been notified about the lock. The reporting party just
               wanted the police to know about the lock. The need for
               maintenance has been documented. No vandalism/malicious
               mischief committed. No further investigation. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               23rd day of August, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W3024 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched to a
               report of a suspicious male on Terrell Mall. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 08-23-2014 at about
               0943 hrs I was dispatched to a report of a suspicious male
               outside the Terrell Library on the Terrell Mall, located at
               1400 NE Terrell Mall. Dispatch advised that the male was on the
               mall and was acting weird. The male was reported to be throwing
               stuff in the air and whirling his backpack. The male was
               described as wearing a red shirt and white and green shorts.
               Officer Jones, Officer Welter, and I arrived on scene. I
               observed about 30 to 40 people on the mall near the entrance to
               the Terrell Library. I saw that they were watching a male on
               the mall who matched the description of the suspicious male.
               The male was later identified as Jedidiah D. Adams (DOB 10-26-
               1988). Adams was wearing headphones and was dancing around as
               if he was listening to music. I watched as he removed various
               items from his backpack (including music CD's, papers, and
               cigarettes) and threw them on the ground. I noticed that
               several spectators in the crowd were filming Adams with their
               cellular telephones. Adams put on his backpack, left all his
               belongings on the ground, and started to walk away. He had a
               cigarette in his mouth and began asking people in the crowd for
               a lighter. Officer Jones and I contacted Adams as he was
               leaving the area and questioned him about his behavior. Adams
               acknowledged that we were talking to him, and he appeared to
               recognize us as police officers. During the conversation, Adams
               mentioned something about Christmas and asked us what we would
               wish for if we could make a wish. I directed Adams to walk back
               to his belongings, which were scattered around on the ground,
               and told him to clean up his mess. With some assistance from
               Officer Jones and I, Adams picked up all his belongings and
               placed them back into his backpack. After interacting with
               Adams, I determined that he did not meet the criteria to be
               taken into protective custody at this time. Adams left the area
               and walked over the library towards Van Doren Hall. Officer
               Jones, Officer Welter, and I cleared the scene. Officer Jones
               recorded the incident on his Vievu camera and later downloaded
               the video. No further action at this time. Olmstead/339 I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and

               trying to talk to women participating in a sorority
               recruitment. The male was being disruptive and had been asked
               to leave. The description of the male was similar to an
               incident that occurred earlier this same day and involved
               Jedidiah D. Adams (DOB 10-26-1988). For more information, see

               carrying an intoxicated or passed out female. All 3 subject
               were contacted and no crime had occurred. The female did not
               need medical attention. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               2. NARRATIVE: On 08/23/14 at approximately 2215 hours I was
               dispatched to a call in the area of Grimes Way and Quad
               Services Road. Dispatch stated someone had reported 2 males
               carrying a female that was very intoxicated or was passed out.
               Dispatch stated the males had taken the female to a silver
               Toyota Corolla near Hulbert Hall. Upon arrival I located the
               Corolla in the Green Parking lot to the east of Hulbert Hall. I
               contacted two males, Todd Justin Pinter 02/15/91 and Jordan
               Earl Palmer 01/04/91, who were standing next to the Corolla. As
               I was exiting my car, Palmer set down an open Keystone Light
               beer can. I told the two what I was dispatched to and they
               stated that their friend, Courtney Amber Druggel 02/18/91, had
               too much to drink so they brought her to the car. Pinter said
               someone was on their way to drive them home. About this time
               Asst. Chief Hansen arrived on scene. I had Pinter and Palmer
               speak to him while I checked on Druffel. Druffel was sitting in
               the passenger seat of the Corolla with the door open. I asked
               Druffel if she was ok and she said she was. I asked Druffel a
               series questions to determine her mental status. Druffel was
               able to answer all my questions correctly even though her
               higher intoxication level. I asked Druffel who the two males
               were. Druffel said Pinter was her boyfriend and Palmer was her
               friend. Druffel said Pinter and Palmer were helping her get
               home. Since a sober driver was already on their way to take
               everybody home, all units cleared. Nothing further. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.

               Neg 1st 4Z0436957 2. NARRATIVE: On 08/23/14 at about 2308 hrs I
               was driving northbound on Stadium Way from Wilson Rd. when I
               noticed a vehicle that was driving southbound on Stadium Way
               from the area of Colorado St. The vehicle, WA 545WKM, caught my
               attention because it was clearly traveling at a speed much
               greater than the posted 20 MPH speed limit. There was a taxi
               between my location and the suspect vehicle, which I obtained a
               speed of 23 MPH for on my vehicle radar (vh 7). I waited for
               the taxi to pass my location and activated my police traffic
               radar unit again, which emitted a high pitched audio doppler
               tone that was steady in pitch. I observed a display of 43 MPH
               on the radar display. The vehicle was the only moving vehicle
               in the radar field at that time and the speed was consistent
               with my visual estimate of the vehicle's speed. The calibration
               of the radar unit was checked both before and after the stop
               with factory certified tuning forks. The radar unit was found
               to be in proper working order. I turned around and initiated a
               traffic stop on the vehicle, turning on my overhead lights. The
               vehicle stopped at the Fine Arts parking garage just off
               Stadium Way. I contacted the driver, Kevin C. Kargol, and told
               him the reason for the stop and the stop was being recorded. I
               asked Kargol if he was in a hurry to get somewhere and he said
               no. I asked Kargol for his driver's license, vehicle
               registration, and proof of insurance. He provided me with his
               driver's license and registration. As I spoke to Kargol I could
               smell the odor of intoxicants emitting from the vehicle. I
               asked Kargol how much alcohol he had to drink and he said none.
               He told me he had been drinking a monster energy drink. I asked
               Kargol if I could check his eyes to make sure he had not been
               drinking and he agreed. I had him turn his upper body toward me
               while he was seated in the car and administered a horizontal
               gaze nystagmus test on him. I observed he had bloodshot and
               watery eyes and a lack of smooth pursuit. I asked Kargol to
               exit the car and he did so. I asked again how much he had to
               drink and he said nothing. I asked if he would perform some
               voluntary field sobriety tests and he agreed. I told him I
               would be evaluating him based on how well he followed all my
               instructions as well as how he performed on the tests. Kargol
               said he understood my instructions. He asked to move to a more

               level spot on the sidewalk so I directed him to just inside the
               entrance to the parking structure, which was well lit and
               level. I could smell the odor of intoxicants on Kargol's breath
               as I spoke to him. The first test I administered was the
               horizontal gaze nystagmus test. I told Kargol to stand with his
               feet together and his arms at his sides. I told him to remain
               in this position for the test. I told him to follow the tip of
               my pen with his eyes only and not to move his head. Kargol said
               he understood. I confirmed Kargol's pupils were of equal size
               and his eyes tracked equally. I observed he had bloodshot and
               watery eyes, a lack of smooth pursuit and a distinct and
               sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes. I had to
               remind Kargol not to move his head during the test. The second
               test I administered was the nine step walk and turn. I told
               Kargol to imagine a straight line on the ground and to place
               his left foot on the line. I told him to put his right foot in
               front of his left, touching heel to toe. I told him to keep his
               arms at his sides and to remain in this position while I
               explained the rest of the test. I told him not to start the
               test until instructed to do so. Kargol said he understood. I
               told Kargol when instructed to begin to take nine steps,
               touching heel to toe, down the imaginary straight line. I told
               him to look at his feet the entire time, count each step out
               loud, and keep his arms at his sides. I told him once he
               reached his ninth step to leave his front foot in place and
               take a series of small steps with his back foot to turn around.
               I told him to take nine more steps back down the same imaginary
               straight line. I told Kargol it was a continuous test so once
               he started the test not to stop until he was finished with the
               test. I reminded him to touch each step heel to toe, count each
               step out loud, and keep his arms at his sides. I demonstrated
               the test and Kargol said he understood my instructions. During
               his first nine steps Kargol did not touch heel to toe between
               steps 4/5 and took 10 steps in his first nine steps. Kargol
               turned improperly, spinning on the balls of both feet. During
               his second nine steps Kargol stopped between steps 2/3. The
               third test I administered was the one leg stand. I told Kargol
               to stand with his feet together and his arms at his sides. I
               told him to remain in this position while I explained the rest
               of the test and not to start until instructed to do so. Kargol
               said he understood. I told Kargol when instructed to begin to
               choose one foot, whichever he was most comfortable with, and
               lift that foot so his toe was approximately six inches off the
               ground. I told him to keep his legs straight and his arms at
               his sides. I told Kargol to look at his toe and count out loud
               by 1000's (1001, 1002, 1003 and so on) until instructed to
               stop. I told Kargol if at any point in time put his foot down
               to pick it right back up and continue where he left off. I
               demonstrated the test and Kargol said he understood my
               insructions. As I was explaining the test Kargol started too
               soon twice. Kargol chose to stand on his left foot, raising his
               right. He began the test looking into the distance and on his
               count of 1002 I reminded him to look at his toe. Kargol had his
               left knee bent throughout the test. He counted to 1020 in 30
               seconds. I asked Kargol if he would provide a breath test on a

               PBT and he refused. I told Kargol I did not think he was
               impaired but I did think he had been drinking. I initially told
               Kargol he was under arrest for Negligent Driving 1st degree. I
               advised him of his right to remain silent and his right to an
               attorney. As I was walking him to my patrol car I remembered
               his ID indicated he was under the age of 21. At that time I
               advised Kargol he was actually going to be under arrest for
               minor operating a motor vehicle after consuming alcohol. Kargol
               was becoming increasingly emotional, stating he had not had any
               alcohol to drink and that he had not been speeding. I asked
               Kargol if he was ok with his friends taking his car if they
               were sober and he said yes. I contacted his passengers and
               determined they were sober. I returned to my patrol car and as
               I was preparing to leave Kargol had an outburst asking what was
               going on with his car and where his car was going. I told him
               he gave me permission to let his friends take the car. I asked
               him again if he wanted me to stop his friends and have the car
               parked in the parking structure. He continued to complain about
               being arrested for something he didn't do. I told him I needed
               an answer about the car and he said his friends could take the
               car. I transported Kargol to the Pullman Police Department. As
               we were en route to PPD Kargol made several statements about
               contacting an attorney. Upon our arrival at the PPD holding
               facility I told Kargol I assumed he wished me to contact an
               attorney based on his statements and he said yes. I contacted
               the on call public defender and allowed Kargol to speak with
               him until I noticed Kargol hang up the phone. I read Kargol his
               Constitutional Rights from the DUI Packet at 2340 hrs and he
               signed stating so. He also signed waiving his rights. I checked
               Kargol's mouth at 2340 hrs and found no foreign substances. I
               read Kargol his implied consent warning for breath at 2346 hrs
               and he signed stating it was read to him. I asked Kargol if he
               would submit to a breath test and he said no. I checked the no
               box on the DUI packet and asked him to initial next to it. As
               he was going to do so he asked a question concerning a possible
               blood draw because he was refusing. I told Kargol that was an
               option and he stopped, saying he would just blow then. I told
               Kargol I was not trying to influence his decision but if he was
               going to change his mind I wanted to make things very clear for
               him. I explained to him I did not care what decision he made
               and it was his choice to provide a breath sample or not. I told
               him if he chose to provide a breath sample we would do that. I
               told him if he refused I could apply for a search warrant with
               a judge, which the judge may or may not grant. I told him if
               the search warrant was granted then I would return and have a
               blood draw performed. He asked to call his mother and I told
               him I already provided him the opportunity to speak with an
               attorney so I was not going to provide him with any additional
               phone calls. Kargol complained about the attorney who he spoke
               with, saying the attorney just told him to do the wrong thing.
               I asked if he was going to provide a breath sample and he said
               no. I had Kargol initial next to the no box on the DUI packet.
               I asked Kargol if he was confused at all by the implied consent
               warnings and he said no. I checked the no box on the DUI
               packet. I began asking Kargol the questions from the DUI

               packet. After several questions he stopped and said the
               attorney told him not to answer any questions. He accused me of
               taking advantage of him saying I was supposed to help him. I
               told him I read him his rights, that he waived those rights,
               and before asking any questions I explained to him he could
               choose to answer the questions or not. I told him I was going
               to take this as meaning he no longer wished to answer any
               questions. I waited for the 15 minute observation period to
               pass. I entered Kargol's information into the datamaster and
               confirmed he wished to refuse to provide a breath sample. He
               said yes and I entered the refusal into the machine. I told
               Kargol because of his low level of alcohol consumption and the
               time involved in applying for a search warrant I would not be
               applying for a search warrant. I told him I would be issuing
               him a citation for Negligent driving 1st degree and placed him
               in a holding cell. I later returned and issued him criminal
               citation #4Z0436957 for Negligent Driving 1st degree. I
               explained the citation to him and he received his copy. I
               provided Kargol with the hearing request form and explained it
               to him. Kargol was released and I provided him with a courtesy
               transport to the Campus Commons apartments so he could meet his
               friends. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 24 day of August,

               met with Jessica Serio of the CUB who informed me that they had
               a policy that required the wearing of footwear in the CUB and
               that she wanted William D. Colvin (091192) to leave the
               building. Colvin was visibly intoxicated with bloodshot and
               watery eyes and labored speech. I could smell the odor of
               intoxicants on his breath. Colvin asked me to provide him with
               the policy number. I told him I did not have the policy, but
               was working off of what Serio was telling me. I informed him
               that he could return with shoes. I also explained that he could
               return to the CUB on Monday to the CUB Administrative Offices
               to discuss the policy. He agreed to leave and did so without
               complication. We cleared. Nothing follows. I certify and

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: mjp/327 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W3042 SYNOPSIS: Samuel D. Adera (070595)
               had his face smashed into a glass window in Pullman's
               jurisdiction. I was in the area and found him in WSU
               jurisdiction. He was transported to PRH and PPD responded to
               investigate. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 082414 at approximately 0053 hours I got out on
               foot at Regents. I walked towards the Scott-Coman alley. As I
               neared the corner I heard glass break nearby. I then walked
               around the corner and saw 6 males walking up the hill and
               towards Coman Hall. The ones that walked to Coman Hall appeared
               to be getting ready to urinate. I instructed them to sit on the
               curb. Most of them appeared to be under 21 and to have been
               drinking based on their eyes and facial expressions. I could
               also smell the odor of intoxicants. As they were sitting down,
               a male, identified as Samuel D. Adera (070595), walked from the
               direction of Alfred Ln and towards us. He was covered in blood
               and actively bleeding from the face and head. I notified
               dispatch of the situation and requested medics. Asst. Chief
               Hansen and Ofc. Boyd arrived as backup. I requested a Pullman
               Officer respond as Adera claimed to have been assaulted in
               their jurisdiction. He claimed to have been thrown into a
               window. The original 6 males seemed to know Adera. One provided
               a t-shirt to staunch the flow of blood. I asked if the 6 had
               seen what happened to Adera and they said they had not been
               present. This made sense based on the short time between me
               hearing the glass break and me seeing the 6 in the alleyway.
               The only one of them that had anything to offer was Daniel W.
               Giday (061995). However, he was significantly intoxicated and
               later taken to PRH due to his consumption (14-W3046). He made
               little sense, but later informed us that he believed the person
               who could have assualted Adera based off of Adera's description
               was a WSU baseball player. He knew this because the assailant
               had been speaking about baseball earlier in the evening. The 5
               males left and Giday stayed. I believe they all had a loose
               association from living at Streit-Perham. Ofc. Heroff responded
               for PPD and I told him what I knew. The house where the event
               took place was 1000 Alfred Ln and it overlooked the area we
               were at. Ofc. Boyd said he saw what looked to be people
               treating someone for a wound in one of the upper rooms. Medics
               responded and determined Adera needed to go to the hospital. He
               appeared to have at least a 3 inch gash over his left eye and
               two 1/4 inch cuts on the top of his head. Ofc. Boyd and Asst.
               Chief Hansen worked with Ofc. Heroff to try and get the

               residents at 1000 Alfred Ln to open the door and speak with
               them but they would not comply. We could see them in there. See
               Ofc. Heroff's report for more details. We cleared and I went to
               Perham Hall as Giday had said someone at room 629 Perham may be
               related to the event. I could not a definitive determination
               based on what Giday had told me. The two residents of the room
               said they had been home that evening. One resident was named
               Carlos and the other Abijah A. Smith (010296). Earlier, Giday
               had been saying one of the people involved was name something
               that sound like "Elijah" but with an "A" a the beginning. I had
               no substantive information to go on to effectively question
               Smith. At this time Giday crawled out of his room 628. He did
               not recognize me and was not making any sense. He was asking
               for his inhaler. He told me the President of the US was George
               Bush. He was not sure where he was. I requested medics. I
               located his inhaler and gave it to him. With a little breath
               sample he provided a PBT of .188. Giday showed me a screenname
               on his phone of Whatten24. He said this related to the baseball
               team. I could not determine more than this. I later found this
               screenname relating to a Weston Hatten on Instagram. It listed
               Hatten as a freshmen baseball player at WSU. I located him in
               our system and determined him to be Weston M. Hatten (050396)
               of 216 Coman Hall. Pullman case from this point on. Nothing
               follows. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 24th day of August, 2014, in Pullman,

               he was leaving the bathroom. The male, later identified as
               Matthew O. Buist (041796), was wiping his mouth as if he just
               got done washing it out. I asked Buist what was going on and he
               told me he had "2 40's and a shotgunned a beer". He said the
               beer made him want to puke so he ran to the bathroom and puked
               a couple times. He said he was ok now. It was clear Buist had
               been drinking but he appeared to be able to care for himself
               and was able to walk/stand without assistance. He knew where he
               was and was able to answer all my questions. Pullman Ambulance
               Personnel arrived and determined Buist was not in need of
               medical attention. Nothing further. I certify and declare under

               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 082414 at
               approximately 0207 hours I was doing follow up on an assault
               (14-W3042) at Perham Hall, near room 628. At this time Daniel
               W. Giday (061995) crawled out of his room. He looked confused
               and disoriented. He did not recognize me from 30 minutes prior
               as he was in the area for the assault I was working on. When he
               spoke he did not making any sense. He was asking for his
               inhaler. He told me the President of the US was George Bush. He
               was not sure where he was. I requested medics. I located his
               inhaler and gave it to him. With a little breath sample he
               provided a PBT of .188. I walked him out the front of Perham
               and gave him to the medics. They determined he needed to go to
               the hospital. I cleared. Nothing follows. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W3047 SYNOPSIS: Hall Staff requested a
               courtesy transport for a student found trespassing and

               Olea (061396) to Student Conduct. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE

               Trespass/Alcohol 2. NARRATIVE: On 082414 at approximately 0438
               hours I was dispatched to Streit Hall. Hall staff was
               requesting a courtesy transport for a student found trespassing
               and intoxicated in Streit Hall. I responded and met with the
               RA's who had found him. They said the on-call RED, RED Piper,
               had recommended calling us for a courtesy transport. Rodolfo
               Olea (061396) had apparently come to Streit Hall with people he
               did not know and was now separated from anyone he knew. He was
               now trespassing. He told me he knew how to get back to his
               residence at Stephenson North. It was evident he had been
               vomitting and he was sitting in a bathroom stall. Olea had lost
               his shoes via his festive evening so I provided him with a
               transport to Stephenson North where an RA met us to get him
               back to his room as he was not sure where his belongings were.
               No idea if lost or stolen. Olea admitted to consuming hard
               alcohol and not beer. I told him I would be referring him to
               Student Conduct for both his trespassing and alcohol
               consumption. I cleaered. Nothing follows. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               24th day of August, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.
