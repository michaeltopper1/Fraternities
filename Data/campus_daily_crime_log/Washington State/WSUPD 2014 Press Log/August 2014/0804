               report of found property. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR#
               1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 08-04-2014 at about 0909 hrs I was
               dispatched to a report of found property at the Stephenson
               Complex, located at 1285 SE Stadium Way. Dispatch advised that
               hall staff members had accumulated some property from the
               residence halls and wished to turn the items over to the police
               department. I arrived on scene and contacted the hall staff
               members at the main desk and saw that they had a box full of
               found property. I provided the hall staff members with a copy
               of the WSU Business Policies and Procedures Manual Chapter
               50.48, which addresses the procedures for handling lost and
               found property. As per the instructions in Chapter 50.48, I
               looked through the property and removed the items of value,
               which consisted of a bank check, debit card, cellular
               telephone, and a pair of earrings. I explained to the hall
               staff members that the police department was only responsible
               for taking valuable items and money. The remainder of the
               property was the responsibility of WSU Residence Life to
               process in accordance with university policy. I cleared the
               scene and later logged the items into property. No further
               action at this time. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this __04__ day
