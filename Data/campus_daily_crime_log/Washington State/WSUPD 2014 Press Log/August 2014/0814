               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W2854 SYNOPSIS: Subject arrested, cited,
               and released for failure to transfer title in 45 days. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Peter A.K. Madakson 02/08/89
               Arrested RCW 46.12.650.7 4Z0796055 2. NARRATIVE: On 08/14/14 at
               approximately 1708 hours I was parked near the Outdoor Rec
               Center monitoring traffic when I noticed a blue PT Cruiser
               heading southbound on North Fairway. The PT Cruiser appeared to
               be traveling faster than the posted 20 MPH zone. I activated my
               handheld radar (Decatur Scout 2013) and obtained a reading of
               30 MPH. When the PT Cruiser reached my location it turned right
               into the Student Rec Center parking lot. I pulled behind the
               car and initiated a traffic stop. When I was walking up to the
               car I noticed the tabs on the license plate displayed 11/2013.
               I contacted the driver, Peter Albert Kumai Madakson 02/08/89,
               identified myself, informed Madakson I was recording, and
               explained the reason for the stop. When I asked about the tabs
               Madakson stated he bought the car from a private party. When
               Madakson when into the DOL, they told him he did not have the
               proper paperwork to transfer the title. Madakson said he tried
               to track down the original owner of the car but could not find
               them. Madakson said he was trying to get the title sorted out
               but he had been busy going to college. I asked for Madakson's
               driver's license and Madakson said he forgot it at home.
               Madakson handed me his WSU student ID card. Madakson also
               provided the vehicle registration. I returned to my patrol car
               and ran Madakson through dispatch. Madakson's return was clear.
               I ran the license plate on my MDC and found that the car was
               sold on 09/16/13 which is one month shy of one year. The title
               had not been transferred into Madakson's name. I returned to
               Madakson and asked him to step out of his car. Once Madakson
               was out of his car I told him he was under arrest for failing
               to transfer the title of the car within 45 days. I handcuffed
               Madakson (D/L) and searched him incident to arrest. No weapons
               or illegal items were found. I placed Madakson in the backseat
               of my patrol car and red Madakson his Miranda Rights. Madakson
               said he understood his rights and having them in mind still
               wished to speak to me. I asked Madakson if there was anything
               in his car he would like out. Madakson said no. I rolled up
               Madakson's window and locked his car. I transported Madakson to
               the Pullman Holding Facility where he was fingerprinted and
               photographed. I issued Madakson a Sector citation for RCW
               46.12.650.7 failure to transfer title within 45 days. I
               explained the citation to Madakson and provided him with his

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC:MJG/309 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W2855 SYNOPSIS:Jamal Alarbai requested
               assistance in contacting a person he bought a I-phone from. The
               phone is corrupted and Jamal needs the log in information.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 08-14-
               14 I was dispatched to a possible theft at Steptoe Village
               Apartments #B102. I responded to the area and contacted Jamal
               Alarbai. Alarbai requested assistance in contacting a person he
               bought a I-phone from. The phone is corrupted and Jamal needs
               the log in information. I asked Jamal to explain what had
               happen. He showed me his cell phone. There was a series of text
               with an un-named person about a i-phone he was selling. The two
               agreed on a price($300) and Jamal was to meet the person at
               Longfellow Grade School at 800 E. Providence Spokane WA. Jamal
               said that when he got there he met a asian male approximately
               15-17 years old. There was also a black male there with the
               asian male. The black male was about the same age. The two
               exchanged the money for the phone and then Jamal left the area.
               When he got home he tried to set the phone up and it was found
               the phone was corrupted. He attempted to contact the asian male
               several times, but the male has yet to respond. We discussed
               Jamal's options. I told him that as of right now I have no way
               of proving the phone is stolen. Therefore it is a civil issue.
               I told him that I would look into the phones status more,but I
               wasn't sure we could do more for him. He understood and
               anything we could do would be appreciated. While I was looking
               at the texts on Jamal's phone I saw that the asian male's phone
               number was 509-587-4224. Above the number it said it was from
               Brewster Washington. I called the Brewster PD and had them do a
               local check to see if that number was connected to anyone
               there. I was not. I did a search on google and it came back to
               a cell number based out of Wenatchee Washington. When I got
               back to the department Jamal had sent me the following
               information. This is the text messages between Jamal and the
               asian male. Dear Sir Monte griffin, Thank you very much indeed
               for considering my case and for the effort you made to solve my
               case. Here are the exchanges text messages: Would you take $300
