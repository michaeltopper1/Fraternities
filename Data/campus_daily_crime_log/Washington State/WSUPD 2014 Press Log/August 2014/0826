    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Tiengo/321 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W3094 SYNOPSIS: RP stated driver of
               vehicle failed to yield to him when he was in the crosswalk on
               Stadium Way by Martin Stadium. RP said driver was also talking
               on his cell phone. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 08-26-14 at approximately 1309 hours Cpl. Daniels
               and I got dispatched to a traffic offense to a vehicle headed
               southbound on Stadium Way near Martin Stadium. The RP stated
               the driver of a vehicle failed to yield to him when he was in
               the crosswalk and that the driver actually sped up as he got
               closer, while he was talking on his cell phone. At
               approximately 1315 hours I tried contacting the RP Barry C.
               Moore (DOB 11-24-53) by phone, but he did not answer so I left
               him a voice mail. At approximately 1341 hours Moore returned my
               phone call. I asked him to describe the vehicle for me and he
               told me it was a green older pickup with a canopy. Moore told
               me that he believed the vehicle was a Ford, but he was not
               positive. When dispatch ran the plate that Moore reported as
               ADN5195 through WA it came back to a green Ford Explorer. I
               told Moore the plate came back to a green Ford Explorer and
               asked if that is what he may have saw and he asked me if it was
               an SUV type and I said yes. Moore said it very well could have
               been a Ford Explorer. I asked Moore for the description of the
               driver and he told me it was a white male in his late 20's or
               early 30's with dirty blonde hair. Moore also said the driver
               had a lot of stubble on his face and almost had a beard, but
               not quite. Moore said the driver was wearing a reflective
               yellow vest and he thought he might be a construction worker.
               Moore told me that the driver actually sped up as he got closer
               to him in the cross walk. Moore said that the vehicle missed
               him by probably 4 feet and that he had to stop walking to avoid
               getting hit. Moore said that if he did not stop walking that
               the vehicle would have hit him. I asked Moore if the driver
               looked at him or acknowledged that he had saw him, Moore said
               the driver did not appear to see him at all and was talking on
               his cell phone. Moore said that he is tired of people texting
               and talking on cell phones and failing to watch out for
               pedestrians. I told Moore that we would go and try to find the
               driver of the vehicle. Moore sounded appreciative and just
               wanted the driver to be educated about yielding to pedestrians.
               There were no local involvement's in Spillman for the
               registered owner Mason. C. Witters (DOB 02-10-91). Cpl. Daniels

               1.Soldano, Cameron S. 061493 Released to friend Unconscious
               male 2. NARRATIVE: On 08-26-14 I was dispatched to an
               unconscious male lying on the grass in between Clark and
               Johnson Halls. The caller stated they the male, later
               identified as Cameron S. Saldano was breathing but un-
               responsive. Upon my arrival I saw a male lying face up on the
               grass. He was breathing. I spoke loudly for him to wake up and
               he immediately open his eyes and sat up and slurred "Lets go.".
               I could tell by his blood watery eyes and slurred speech he was
               intoxicated. I asked him for his identification and he provided
               a United States Marine Corps ID. The medics arrived and
               determined he was no a candidate for detox. I asked Soldano if
               he was on active duty and he said he was. I asked him what he
               was doing in Pullman and he said he was on leave to see his
               girlfriend. I asked him how much he had to drink and he said
               about 7 beers. After speaking to him a female walked up and
               identified herself as Saldano's girlfriend. Since he was not a
               detox candidate and was over 21 years of age, Saldano was
               allowed to leave with the girlfriend. I did not identify the
               female. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 26th day of August, 2014, in Pullman,

               418 Scott Hall. No suspects or leads. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 082614 at approximately 2108
               hours, I was dispatched to a report of a theft in room 418
               Scott Hall. Upon arrival, I contacted Justin K. Hancock who
               told me the following. On 082414 at approximately 1800 hours,
               he put his WSU Athletics issued Apple IPad on the floor next to
               his desk. He stated that he didn't recall seeing it yesterday,
               and noticed it was missing at approximately 2030 hours on
               082614. I asked him what model of IPad he was issued and he
               told me a Mac Air valued at approxiamtely $700.00. I asked him
               if he logged it into the WSU WIFI and he told me he did using
               his account (justin.hancock) as his NID. I asked him if he had
               any other electronic devices and he told me he owned a Apple I
               phone as well. I asked if I could look at his Mac Address to
               help narrow down his I pad's Mac Address and he told me I
               could. I found his MAC address for his I phone as
               E4:25:E7;04:7B; 2B. I advised him that I would see if IT could
               locate the IPad's Mac Address and have it flagged on campus. I
               advised Hancock that I would need him to contact Athletics with
               WSU and advise them that he was missing the Mac Air and see if
               they had the serial number and model number for NCIC entry. He
               told me he would look into it for me. I asked Hancock if he
               left his room unlocked and he told me that it is usually locked
               unless he is going to the bathroom or taking a shower. Hancock
               believes that the Ipad went missing when his room was unlocked.
               He told me he didn't believe that anything else was stolen. I
               gave him my business card and asked him to call me if he
               develops any suspects or leads. Case inactive pending further
               leads. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the
               laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
