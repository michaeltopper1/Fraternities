               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: Hall Director, Joshua McPhatter,
               reported the odor of marijuana coming from room 1019 of Rogers
               Hall. When I arrived on location I could smell a faint odor of
               marijuana coming from the room. I could also smell a strong
               sweet smell coming from the room as if the odor of marijuana
               was trying to be masked. I knocked on the door several times,
               as well as announcing who I was, but no one answered the door.
               The RA who had initially detected the odor told me she believed
               she heard noises coming from the room after smelling the odor.
               She also said she had been outside the room since, and no one
               had entered or left the room. I did not get the name of the RA.
               I also learned from McPhatter this room had been contacted on
               8/26/14 for the same reason, and with the same results, no one
               answering the door (case 14-W3093). McPhatter said they would
               add this situation to the other, and handle them through
               Student Conduct. The residents of the room are 18 year old
               Nicholas Salle, and 19 year old Kellen O'Connor. No further

               male in a stairwell of north side hall. Subject was evaluated

               his roommate. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Zachary
               Z. Shuler/091895 2. NARRATIVE: On 08/29/14 at about 0209 hrs
               Dispatch advised of a report there was an unconscious male in a
               stairwell at Northside Hall. I responded and located the male,
               in a stairway near the main entrance to Northside Hall. The
               male, later identified as Zachary Z. Shuler (091895), was
               conscious and sitting up upon my arrival. Shuler had vomited
               all over the stairway and was clearly intoxicated. Shuler was
               able to provide me with his name but was not able to tell me
               where he lived. Pullman ambulance personnel arrived and
               determined Shuler could stay with his roommate. We walked
               Shuler to his room, nothing further. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               29 day of August, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.
