               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W2746 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched to a 911
               hang-up call near Albrook Hydraulics Laboratory. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 08-03-2014 at
               about 0741 hrs I was dispatched to a 911 hang-up call from the
               PAT telephone located near the northeast corner of Albrook
               Hydraulics Laboratory, 855 NE Oak Street. Dispatch advised that
               a male caller on the line reported a domestic dispute involving
               a firearm in Albion, Washington. The male caller hung up and
               did not provide any further information. Dispatch advised that
               WCSO deputies were responding to the scene in Albion. Sergeant
               Larsen and I responded to the PAT telephone and searched the
               area. The telephone was not being used, and we did not observe
               anyone in the area. Sergeant Larsen and I cleared the scene.
               Dispatch later advised that WCSO deputies had arrived in Albion
               and determined that there was no domestic dispute. It appears
               that the originating 911 call from the PAT telephone was a
               false report. No further action at this time. Olmstead/339 I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this _03___ day of __August____, 2014, in

               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 08-03-2014 at
               about 1015 hrs I was dispatched to a 911 hang-up call from the
               PAT telephone located near the northeast corner of Albrook
               Hydraulics Laboratory, 855 NE Oak Street. Dispatch advised that
               a male caller on the line reported a subject out of control in
               Albion, Washington. The dispatcher attempted to ask the caller
               where he was at, and the line went quite. Dispatch advised that
               the line was still open. Sergeant Larsen and I responded to the
               PAT telephone, and with the assistance of PPD officers,
               searched the area. The telephone was not being used, and I saw
               that the telephone handset had not been returned to the cradle
               and was hanging from the cord. After searching the surrounding
               area, the responding officers did not identify anyone in the
               area who could have been using the PAT telephone. Individuals
               were contacted by officers near Sloan Hall and on Oak Street,
               but none of them had observed any suspicious activity. Sergeant
               Larsen and I cleared the scene. This was the second suspicious
               911 hang-up call received from the PAT telephone on this day.
               For more information, see related case #14-W2746. It appears
               that both 911 calls from the PAT telephone have been false
               reports. No further action at this time. Olmstead/339 I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: MFL/313 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W2748 SYNOPSIS: Victoria-Pearl Young was
               riding a WSU Green Bike westbound on the sidewalk that is south
               of Waller Hall and runs parallel to Stadium Way (sidewalk is up
               the hill from the actual roadway). Young was riding toward a T-
               intersection that is near the east side of Nevada Street, when
               her brakes failed to stop her. Young crashed into a railing and
               was transported to PRH. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               2. NARRATIVE: On 080314 at about 1050hrs, I was called to a
               bicycle accident on a sidewalk south of Waller Hall. Victoria-
               Pearl Young was riding a WSU Green Bike (S/N P0700736)
               westbound on the sidewalk that is south of Waller Hall and runs
               parallel to Stadium Way (the sidewalk is up the hill from the
               actual roadway). Young was riding toward a T-intersection that
               is near the east side of Nevada Street, when her brakes failed
               to stop the bike for her. Young approached a railing but could
               not slow down enough to make a right-hand turn. Young crashed
               into the railing that is meant to keep pedestrians from falling
               down onto Nevada Street. When I arrived I contacted Young who
               told me what had happened. She also said her left hip, thigh,
               and knee hurt. I also contacted Corey King who was helping her
               and he said that he had seen the accident happen. King was in
               his vehicle at a stop light on Nevada Street (facing north),
               waiting to turn left onto Stadium Way. He said that he saw
               Young riding on the bicycle westbound toward the railing. He
               said that it did not seem like she slowed down at all as she
               approached the railing. King indicated that she crashed into
               the railing and that is when he responded to help her. She had
               told him that the brakes on the bicycle did not work and that
               is why she crashed. Young was checked out by the Pullman Fire
               department and then she was transported to PRH. I grabbed the
               bicycle and walked it up the sidewalk about 30 yards. I gripped
               the brake levers and the brakes slightly engaged. I then got on
               the bicycle and rode down the sidewalk and the brakes did not
               work very well at all. A rider would have had to have started
               braking the bike a significant distance before making the turn.
               I took pictures of the bike and the area and transported the
               bike to the WSU Police Department. The bike was locked up in a
               secure room only accessible by commissioned officers. At
               1353hrs, I talked with Rhonda Kromm (509-432-3422), Victoria-
               Pearl Young's mother, about the bicycle. She was worried about
               the bike being turned over to to the CUB without an independent
               bicyle technicial evaluation the brakes. Victoria-Pearl told
               her mother that she did not feel any resistance from the brakes

               at all. I told her how I had tested the brakes and we agreed
               that an independent bike shop should evaluate the brakes to
               determine the level of brake operation and/or brake
               effectiveness. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing

               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Brazilia Vallego De Hernandez 06/19/70 Arrested
               DWLS 3rd 4Z0777903 2. NARRATIVE: On 08/03/14 at approximately
               1913 hours I was driving eastbound on Stadium Way near Nevada
               Street when I noticed a silver Toyota Corolla in front of me.
               The tabs on the California license plate displayed, 05/2014.
               Since the tabs were expired I initiated a traffic stop at
               Stadium Way and Gannon Hall. I contacted the driver Brazilia
               Vallego De Hernandez 06/19/70, identified myself, informed
               Hernandez I was recording, and told her about the expired tabs.
               Hernandez said that she had already bought the tabs but forgot
               to put them on her car before leaving from California.
               Hernandez provided me with her California Driver's License and
               vehicle registration. I returned to my patrol car and ran
               Hernandez through dispatch. Dispatch stated that Hernandez's
               driver's license was suspended through California for failure
               to appear on a traffic citation. About this time Ofc. Kirshner
               arrived on scene. I asked Hernandez to come talk with me on the
               sidewalk. Once on the sidewalk, I told Hernandez that her tabs
               had not been purchased and they were still expired. I asked
               Hernandez if she knew her license was suspended. Hernandez said
               that she had forgotten about a ticket she had received and the
               people at the court told her her license would be suspended on
               08/02/14 if she did not pay the ticket. Hernandez said she sent
               in a check about two weeks ago. I told Hernandez that her
               license was suspended and that she was under arrest. I
               handcuffed (D/L) Hernandez and advised her of her right to
               counsel. Hernandez was placed in the backseat of my patrol car
               and seatbelted in. Hernandez's son, Jesus Alexis Lopez
               Hernandez 01/08/97, was sitting in the passenger's seat. I
               asked Hernandez if Jesus had a driver's license and she said
               no. I explained the options for her car and Hernandez stated
               that she wished an Officer to park the car for her. Ofc.
               Kirshner parked the car in the McAllister parking lot. I spoke
               with Jesus and told him the situation. Jesus asked if he could
               go with his mom to the station and I told him that was fine. I
               transported both Hernandez and Jesus to Pullman Holding
               Facility. Once we arrived I had Jesus wait in the lobby while I
               processed Hernandez. Hernandez was fingerprinted and
               photographed. I issued Hernandez a Sector citation of RCW
               46.20.342.1C Driving While License Suspended in the 3rd Degree.
               I explained the citation to Hernandez and provided her with her

               approximately 1938 hours, Nicholas A. Prante called Whitcom
               stating a male had driven his vehicle near the outdoor
               basketball courts of the WSU Student Recreation Center and it
               looked as if he was setting up to camp out. I drove to the area
               of the WSU Student Recreation Center outdoor basketball courts
               and saw a black Land Rover (WA/AKX2538) parked in the area.
               This area is off limits to private vehicles. The Land Rover was
               packed full of items and there were several items already
               outside of the vehicle. Some of the items already outside of
               the vehicle were a large shade umbrella, a shelf with a stereo
               on it, a couple of pads, and a couple of chairs. As I began
               walking toward the Land Rover a male; later identified as
               Ibrahim Abdulwahid, saw me and began walking toward me. I asked
               him if the Land Rover and other items belonged to him and he
               said they did. I asked him what he was doing and he said he
               wanted to make the area feel like he was in Hawaii. I told him
               he was not allowed to have his vehicle in the area and he said
               he would move it immediately. He began packing his things into
               his car in order to move. He did not cause any damage to the
               area, therefore there was no crime committed. Nothing further.

               2. NARRATIVE: On 08/03/14 at approximately 2125 hours, Ofc.
               Boyd and I responded to 6202 SR 270 at the request of the
               Whitman County Sheriff's Department. Dispatch stated that a
               physical assault occurred between two bothers at 6202 SR 270.
               Dispatch also stated that the parties had been separated. Upon
               arrival I contacted, Samuel James Adams 10/26/88 (twin brother
               of Jedidiah), Willard Dale Adams 07/02/46 (father), and Janet
               Annette Adams 09/10/54 (mother). I noticed Samuel was holding a
               tissue to his nose that had dried blood on it. I asked
               everybody what happened. Samuel stated that he and his twin
               brother, Jedidiah (Jed) were on their way home when an argument
               started. The argument intensified to the point where Jed got
               out of the car when Samuel came to a stop at the instersection
               of E. Main and Bishop Ave in Pullman. Samuel could not convince
               Jed to get back in the car so Samuel continued to his parents
               house. Once he arrived home he told his parents what happened
               and his mother and father went to go find Jed. Willard and
               Janet found Jed and brought him home. As soon as they pulled
               into the drive way, Jed stormed out of the car and rushed into
               the house. Jed walked up to Samuel and pined him against the
               wall. Jeb was grabbing Samuel by the neck. Jeb got behind
               Samuel and put Samuel in a choke hold. Jeb dragged Samuel out
               of the house while choking Samuel. Samuel later said he was
               struggling to breath because Jeb was choking him so tight. Once
               the two got outside, Willard tried to intervene. With Willard's
               held Samuel was able to get Jeb to stop choking him. While
               Willard was trying to separate the two, Jeb punched Samuel in
               the nose, causing his nose to bleed. Samuel said the argument
               went back to verbal and Jeb was calling their father names.
               Willard started to head back to the house and Jeb pushed
               Willard to the ground. Willard later stated that he fell to the
               ground and landed on the grass. Willard had a small scrape to
               his left forearm that had bled. Jeb then left to the house next
               door 6204 SR 270 which belongs to Willard and Janet. About this
               time Janet called 911. I asked to look at Samuel's neck and I
               noticed it had a slight red coloration to it but no visible
               scratches or abrasions. Samuel's right nostril had dried blood
               on it. About this time Deputies DeRosier and Nebe arrived on
               scene. Willard stated that Jeb was last seen walking to the

               next house over which is where Jeb has been sleeping. Ofc.
               Boyd, both Deputies, and I walked over to house number 6204
               where Jeb was supposed to be. Dep. DeRosier knocked on the door
               but nobody answered. I returned to Janet and asked if we had
               her permission to enter the house Jeb had been staying in.
               Janet said that was fine and provided me with a key for the
               door. Dep. Nebe, Dep. DeRosier, and Ofc. Boyd entered and
               searched the house for Jeb. During the search nobody was found
               inside. Dep. DeRosier and I returned to the family while Dep.
               Nebe and Ofc. Boyd searched the surrounding area for Jeb. Dep.
               DeRosier took over the investigation and interviewed Samuel,
               Willard, and Janet as I stood by. Once the interviews were
               completed, all units cleared. Charges of Assault will be
               forwarded to the prosecutor by Dep. DeRosier. Nothing further.
               I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws
               of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 4th day of July, 2014, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer
