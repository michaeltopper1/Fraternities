               Sims was booked into the Whitman County Jail. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE 1. Shon Drea Curtis Sims 10/13/94 Arrested/Booked Theft
               3rd Degree Criminal Trespass NARRATIVE: On 08/20/14 at
               approximately 1726 hours, I was dispatched to a theft call at
               Streit Hall room 133. Dispatch stated that the reporting party,
               Aleesia Jamaye McKinney 03/23/95, was requesting phone contact.
               I called McKinney and she provided to following account:
               McKinney is friends with Shon Drea Curtis Sims 10/13/94 from
               when she lived in the Seattle area. Sims' grandmother called
               her asking if Sims could stay with her for the night since he
               did not have anywhere to go. McKinney allowed Sims to stay with
               her the night of 08/19/14. In the afternoon of 08/20/14 Sims
               had recived a call from another relative of Sims. The relative
               told McKinney that Sims had been told he was not allowed on the
               WSU campus. McKinney said she returned to her dorm room at
               Streit Hall around 1600 hours and told Sims that he could not
               stay with her since he was not allowed on campus. McKinney
               stated she left her room and went to her friends room on the
               5th floor of Streit Hall to change her clothes and allow Sims
               to collect his items and leave. About 30 minutes later McKinney
               returned to her room and Sims had left. McKinney was looking
               around her room and noticed that her Ipad mini, Iphone 4s, and
               Ipad charging cord were missing. McKinney believed Sims had
               taken the items because the door was locked when she left the
               room. Sims had called Sims mother who told her to file a Police
               report if she felt it was necessary. I asked McKinney if she
               knew where Sims would go. McKinney said that Sims had been on
               her laptop using his email. McKinney stated that Sims left his
               email open and the email that was open said he was going to
               meet a person at 210 NW Terre View Drive, unit E to look at an
               apartment for rent. I told McKinney that I would head over to
               Terre View and look for Sims. McKinney said Sims was wearing a
               green shirt, blue jeans, and a white belt when she last saw
               him. I responded to 210 NW Terre View to see if I could find
               Sims. I knew he drives a light blue 2008 Honda Fit with
               Tennessee license plates. I searched the area and surrounding
               apartment complexes but was unable to locate Sims. I drove by
               all the apartment rental business and did not find Sims.
               Knowing that Sims did not have a place to stay I checked,
               Dismorres, Safeway, and the Wheatland Shopping Center. I also
               decided to check the Walmart parking lot for Sims. at 1829

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
               hours I entered the parking lot from Harvest Drive and I
               noticed Sims and a female walking out of Walmart. I instantly
               recognized Sims because I had his jail booking photo from 5
               days earlier up on my computer. Sims had a light weight jacket
               and a silver Ipad mini in his right hand. I exited my car and
               called out Shon Drea Sims. Sims answered to his name and said
               yes. Sims was wearing the clothing that McKinney had described.
               I told Sims that I needed to talk with his and had Sims put his
               jacket and Ipad on the trunk of my patrol car. I told Sims that
               he was currently being detained. I placed Sims in the backseat
               of my patrol car. I asked the female, later identified as
               Nefeteria Louise Bolin 12/05/94, how long she has known Sims.
               Bolin said she has known Sims for about a year now. I asked
               Bolin to walk me through from the time she meet up with Sims.
               Bolin said she meet Sims outside of Streit Perham around 1600
               hours. They then walked to McDonalds and got something to eat.
               From there they took a Pullman Transit Bus to Walmart at around
               1730 hours. Bolin had a Iphone in her hand and I asked about
               it. Bolin said it was hers. I asked if I could look at it and
               she handed it to me. There were a lot of photos of Bolin on the
               phone from the last few months. It was clear the the phone was
               Bolin's and not McKinney's. I asked Bolin if Sims had a cell
               phone with him. Bolin said he had asked Sims if she could use
               his phone and Sims told Bolin his was dead. I told Bolin that
               she was free to go. Around this time Sgt. Jacobsen arrived on
               scene. I called McKinney and asked if she was willing to do a
               show up at Walmart to see if the person I was detaining was the
               person who took her Ipad. McKinney said she would. Sgt.
               Jacobsen drove to Streit Hall and picked up McKinney. While
               waiting for Sgt. Jacobsen to arrive with McKinney I interviewed
               Sims. I read Sims his Miranda Rights off my department issued
               card. I asked Sims if he understood his rights and he said he
               did. I asked Sims, having his rights in mind did he still wish
               to speak with me. Sims said yes. Sims asked me what his
               detention was about. I told Sims that I had received a report
               that he had taken an Ipad and Iphone from a person in Streit
               Hall. Sims said he could explain. Sims stated that he was
               staying with McKinney and he left the room to go to the
               bathroom when McKinney's dorm room shut. When the door closed
               it was also locked so Sims was unable to get back into the
               room. Sims said that since the cell phone that he had of
               McKinney's did not work he was unable to tell her that he had
               it and her Ipad. Sims stated the the Police had seized his
               personal cell phone so he was using the Ipad for facebook to
               communicate with people "because I'm not suposed to be on WAZZU
               grounds." Sims said he had McKinney's Iphone in his pocket. I
               asked Sims why he did not just leave the Ipad and Iphone at the
               door of the room or just wait till McKinney to come back to her
               room. Sims said McKinney told him that she did not know how
               long she would be gone. I asked Sims if McKinney gave him
               permission to take her items. Sims said he had permission to
               use the items but not to take them from the room. I told Sims
               that on Monday 08/18/14 Ofc. Kirshner meet with him and told
               Sims that he was trespassed from all of WSU campus and if he
               was found on the campus or an investigation showed that he was

               on the campus, he would be arrested for Criminal Trespass. Sims
               said, "I admit it, I violated that condition." Sims said he had
               no other place to go so that is why he stayed with McKinney.
               When Sgt. Jacobsen arrived at Walmart with McKinney I
               reinterviewed her. McKinney provided the same story that she
               had earlier provided. I asked McKinney if Sims had her
               permission to take her property from the room. McKinney said
               no. I asked McKinney if Sims had her permission to remove her
               property from the building and again she said no. I asked
               McKinney to describe her Ipad and Iphone. Mckinney said the
               Ipad was white and silver and had a crack on the backside. The
               Ipad's wallpaper was a picture of her and her mother. McKinney
               said the Iphone is not currently working but it has a blue and
               black case on it. I asked McKinney if she would walk up to my
               patrol car and see if the person sitting in my backseat was the
               person who had stayed with her the night before. McKinney
               walked up to my patrol car and said it was. McKinney spoke with
               Sims for a minute as I stood near by. After McKinney spoke with
               Sims I asked her to see if the Ipad was hers. McKinney was able
               to unlock the Ipad using her password and showed me the picture
               she described. I asked if the Iphone was hers and she said yes
               but it was missing the case. I asked Sims where the case for
               her phone was. Sims said he took the case off the phone so he
               could turn the phone on. Sims said the case was still in
               McKinney's room. I asked about the Ipad charger and Sims said
               it was under McKinney's bed. I photographed the Ipad and Iphone
               and took down the serial numbers. I provided McKinney with my
               business card and her case number. Sgt. Jacobsen gave McKinney
               a ride back to her dorm. I told Sims that he was under arrest
               for Theft and Criminal Trespass at 1920 hours. I transported
               Sims to the Pullman Holding Facility. Once at the facility I
               searched Sims incident to arrest. In Sims pocket I found a Ipad
               charger as McKinney had described. I asked Sims who charger it
               was and Sims said it was McKinney's. Sims requested to speak
               with a lawyer. I called Steve Martonick who was the on call
               public defender. Sims spoke with Martonick for about 10
               minutes. Sims' property was inventoried and Sims was placed in
               a cell. I drove to Streit Hall and gave McKinney her Ipad
               charger back. Once I returned to the station, I looked up
               prices on used Ipad minis. Most Ipad Minis like McKinney's are
               going for about $300 dollars. I also found that used white
               Iphone 4s cell phones go for about $200 dollars. The Ipad
               charging cord costs $17 dollars. Sims stole a total of $517
               dollars worth of stuff from McKinney. Sims was later booked
               into the Whitman County Jail for RCW 9A.52.070 Criminal
               Trespass in the first Degree and RCW 9A.56.050 Theft 3rd
               Degree. Charges will be forwarded to the prosecutor. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.

               On 082014 at approximately 2127 hours, I was dispatched to a
               report of the odor of marijuana coming from room 249 Stimson
               Hall. Upon arrival, I contacted Ethan C. Hoctor who told me the
               following. His roommate just got to WSU earlier in the day and
               that he thought he was messing around with marijuana and
               measuring it. I asked him where is roommate was and he told me
               he left to go meet someone. I asked Hoctor if he knew his
               roommate's phone number and he told me he didn't. Hoctor told
               me that he has never used, smelled or even seen marijuana. I
               explained to Hoctor that he should seek room reassignment or
               have a chat with his roommate about the use of drugs in their
               room. Hoctor told me he would. I asked the Hall Director,
               Aubrie L. Piper, if she had Hoctor's roommate's name and she
               told me it was Mitch Stewart. I checked zzusis for Stewart's

               Timothy D. 02/07/95 Warned Trespassing NARRATIVE: Officer
               Stewart and I arrived at Kimbrough Hall and checked the roof
               for individuals. At this time no one was found on the roof.
               Officer Stewart learned from the RP, James Kusznir, that the
               individual on the roof had gotten off the roof and left the
               area shortly before our arrival. Just a couple of minutes after
               clearing the area Kusznir reports that there are people on the
               roof again. While I'm in Kimbrough Hall to access the roof
               Officer Stewart contacts two individuals getting off the roof
               at the south entrance of Kimbrough Hall. The two individuals
               are identified as Christina M. Larsen and Timothy D. Wilson.
               Both individuals were cooperative as they were warned they
               could be charged with Trespassing for getting on the roof of
               any WSU building without proper permission. Larsen and Wilson
               were informed this situation would be forwarded to Student
               Conduct. The roof was checked and no one else, at that time,
               was found to be on the roof. No further at this time. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the

               Marijuana 2.Evans, Maximilian M. 08/02/96 Warned Possession of
               Marijuana NARRATIVE: On 8/21/14 at about 0002 hours the odor of
               marijuana was reported coming from room 009 of Stimson Hall.
               Officer Stewart and I responded to the room. On arrival we met
               with Aubrie Piper, the on-call Hall Director, who had reported
               the situation. Piper informed us a group of individuals had
               entered the room just a few minutes before our arrival.
               Standing in front of the door of room 009 I could detect a
               slight odor of burnt marijuana. Knocking on the door it was
               answered by resident Maximilian Evans. As soon as Evans opened
               the door a stronger odor of burnt marijuana could be smelled
               coming from the room. After explaining to Evans why I was there
               I asked all occupants of the room to step out into the hallway
               and have a seat on the floor. All seven occupants complied. The
               seven occupants were; Evans, Brian Dunphy, Phillip Happe-
               Hartsell, Taylor Sletvik, Kiona Goodman, Fiona Chapman, Jacob
               Yancey. Evans and Dunphy being the residents of the room. Once
               everyone was in the hall I again explained the purpose of our
               visit. I explained to the group as long as I received
               cooperation, and no other crimes were discovered, this incident
               would be handled through Student Conduct and criminal charges
               would not be pursued. At this time Evans and Dunphy explained
               they had smoked a little marijuana about 45 minutes before our
               arrival, and none had been smoked in the presence, or by,
               Happe-Hartsell, Sletvik, Goodman, Chapman and Yancey. Since
               Piper had detected the odor before these individuals arrived,
               and being present when they arrived, as well as not observing
               any signs from them that they had been smoking, it is believed
               these individuals were not involved I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this ____ day of

               NARRATIVE: On 082114 at approximately 0116 hours, I was on
               routine patrol in the area of Olympia Avenue near Forest Way.
               As I was driving EB on Olympia Avenue from the Forest Way
               intersection, I noticed a group of people walking WB along
               Forest Way in the shadows. As I drove past, I saw a male, later
               identified as Eli Porkka, carrying a sign in his left hand. I
               turned my patrol car around and drove back to the group and
               contacted them. When I exited my patrol car, Porkka was no
               longer had the sign in his hand. I asked him where the sign was
               and he told me he didn't know what I was talking about. I asked
