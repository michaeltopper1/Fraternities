               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W2942 SYNOPSIS: Officer provided a
               courtesy transport to a subject who had been contacted by
               police officers over the weekend. Subject was transported to a
               friends home. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 081914 at about 0900hrs, Shon'Drea Curtis Sims
               came to the WSU Police Department to ask about some of his
               property that was seized. I told him what was seized and that
               he would not be getting the property back until the case was
               adjudicated. That property included two cell phones. I also
               noticed that PPD had taken two reports (a missing persons
               report and a welfare check) that involved Sims. I had just been
               talking to Sims' Aunt, Leila Sims (425-652-2558), who was
               worried about Shon'Drea because she had not heard from him. I
               was able to call her back and had Shon'Drea talk to her and his
               Grandmother. While he talked to his family I attempted to
               contact the WSU Office of Student Accountability to see if they
               had any trespass paperwork ready. I was not able to contact
               anyone from that office. I reiterated to Sims that he was
               trespassed from the WSU Pullman Campus and that he would have
               to contact our office if he wanted to meet with any WSU School
               Officials concerning his arrest last Friday. He said that he
               understood. I told him to also contact us if his family came to
               Pullman to help him move back to Kent, WA so that we could give
               him any paperwork. He said that he understood that as well. I
               called PPD Officer Aaron Breshears to let him know that Sims
               has been contacted and that he was fine and that he has
               contacted his family. I then transport Sims to his friends
               house, Jedidiah Adams, out on HWY 270 (6204 SR 270). He said
               that he met Adams in jail and that they shared a taxi ride home
               yesterday. Nothing further. MFL/313 I certify and declare under

               082014 at approximately 0054 hours, I was dispatched to
               Stephenson East 1109 regarding the odor of marijuana coming
               from the room. Upon arrvival, I contacted Sarah Alrashoodi who
               told me she confirmed the odor. I responded to the room and was
               unable to smell the odor of marijuana in the hallway. I knocked
               on the door and a male opened the door. At that point, I
               smelled a strong odor of marijuana coming from the room. I
               asked all of the occupants to exit the room and sit in the
               hallway which they did. The occupants were identified as Stein,
               Peterson, Britton, Nam, and Hodgerney. I explained to them that
               I was there because their room smelled like marijuana. I asked
               who lived in room 1109 and Stein stated he did. I asked how
               many people in the room were smoking marijuana and everyone but
               Nam admitted to smoking marijuana. I explained to them that
               there were two options I had in dealing with the issue. First
               being they could decide to destroy all their marijuana and
               smoking devices and this would be sent to WSU Student Conduct
               for disciplinary action through the university. Secondly they
               could decline to destroy their drugs and smoking devices and
               that would result in me applying for a search warrant. I
               explained that if the warrant was granted, I would search the
               room and place the persons responsible for the marijuana under
               arrest and process them in accordance with the law. The five of
               them quickly told me they would like to destroy their items and
               be sent to WSU Student Conduct. I asked them to retrieve all
               the drugs and smoking devices from the room and Stein, Britton
               and Hodgerney entered the room and brought out two glass bongs
               several bottles containing marijuana and a few pipes. I asked
               them to follow me down to the dumpster where they could dispose
               of their items and they complied. At the dumpster, they broke
               the glass smoking devices and poured the marijuana on the
               ground using their shoes to grind it in making it nearly
               impossible to differentiate between dirt and marijuana. I
               thanked them for their cooperation and explained that if caught
               again, they would most likely be arrested and taken to jail.
