               One car non-injury collision DRIVER 1: Jared Kersey Powell
               02/08/92 VEHICLE 1: WA/25936E 2014 Dodge Grand Caravan
               INSURANCE: WSU Risk Management DAMAGE: $500 dollars NARRATIVE:
               On 08/08/14 at approximately 1729 hours, I responded to a non-
               injury collision near the CUB. Dispatch stated a WSU van had
               struck a cement barrier. Upon arrival I found the van on the
               eastside of the the CUB. I contacted the driver Jared Kersey
               Powell 02/08/92, and asked him what happened. Powell said he
               was backing up the van when he hit the cement barrier. Powell
               said he never saw it. The barrier is a three foot by three foot
               square and about two and a half feet high. The cement barriers
               are there to prevent vehicles from getting too close to the
               building. I looked at the van and and saw that the passenger's
               side rear bumper had sideswiped the cement barrier. There was
               an approximate two and a half foot long dented section of the
               fiberglass bumper. The impact caused the bumper to separate
               from the rear quarter panel. The damage to the bumper is
               estimated at $500 dollars. There was no damage to the cement
               barrier. Photos of the van and barrier were uploaded to the
               files folder. I provided Powell with my business card and his
               case number. Powell stated he already notified his supervisor
               of the collision. I gave Powell the number to WSU Risk
               Management as well. This case will be referred to WSU Risk
               Management. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 8th day of

               4 year old kids. I responded with WCSO and did not find a
               threat to anyones life. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               2. NARRATIVE: On 080814 at approximately 2011 hours I responded
               to a Welfare Check at the Pullman Albion Rd Trailer Park. The
               RP reported that the mother of his children threatened to kill
               herself and their two 4 year old kids. I was familiar with the
               family and the closest County unit was in Oakesdale. I
               responded and contacted Lameece N. Dillsi (020273) at her
               residence. I could see in the house and saw her two children
               and they did not appear to be in any distress. I spoke with her
               outside. I informed her I was checking on her and that a County
               unit would be responding. She was not surprised to see me. We
               made small talk while we waited for Deputy Neebe to arrive. She
               described a cycle of emotional, physical, and drug abuse. She
               was emotional and stated that she does get depressed due to the
               way that the RP, Tyler, treats her. I talked to her about ATVP
               and subsequently gave her a Domestic Violence information card.
               She denied wanting to hurt herself or her kids. Deputy Neebe
               arrived and I filled him in and then he spoke with her. Once he
               was done speaking with her I cleared and Deputy Neebe contacted
               Tyler. I cleared. Nothing follows. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 9th day of
