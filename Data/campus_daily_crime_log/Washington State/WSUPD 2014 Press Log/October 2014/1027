               that she received two nuisance phones calls around 0300hrs
               about six days ago. She was concerned and wanted the calls
               documented. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 102714 at about 0900hrs I received an email
               forwarded by WSUPD Records from a WSU student who wanted to
               report two nuisance phone calls. Kelsey A Morrison (102292)
               wanted to report that she received a phone call on 102114 at
               about 0317hrs on her cell phone. The caller ID displayed the
               word "private" and she ignored the call but the caller called
               again. Morrison was irritated about the call, but she answered
               it and the caller, named Derek, called her by her first name
               and asked if he, "could come to my voice." Morrison terminated
               the phone call. Morrison said the the caller's voice sounded
               garbled and she was a little concerned because she does not
               know anyone by that name. I talked to Morrison today and she
               indicated that she has not received any additional nuisance
               phone calls and thinks the two she initially received were
               prank calls. Nothing further at this time. MFL/313 I certify

               called stating she had not been able to contact her daughter
               (Katherine) for just over 5 hours and was concerned. Katherine
               called her parents and said she was fine, her phone battery
               died. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               10-27-14, Debbie D. Templeton (01-05-60) called Whitcom stating
               she had not heard from her daughter in 5 hours and was
               concerned for her safety. According to Whitcom, Templeton's
               daughter, Katherine, had called her approximately 5 hours
               earlier stating a male had approached her while in the Holland
               Library. Katherine told her mother the male was of Cuban
               descent and was "All tatted up". The male pulled a book off of
               the book shelf and sat down beside Katherine. He began telling
               her she was beautiful and he wanted to go out with her. He
               asked for her cell phone number and she gave it to him. He
               asked her to leave the library with him, but she told him she
               did not feel comfortable doing so. The male left. Templeton
               became concerned as she has not been able to contact her
               daughter since they had their earlier conversation. She was
               concerned that the Cuban male may have kidnapped her daughter
               because she is NEVER not able to contact her daughter. I
               responded to Katherine's apartment, 710 SE Chinook Dr, Apt K-
               51, and spoke with Katherine's roommates, Jennifer A. Duke and
               Elliot C. Lawrence. Both of her roommates said they had not
               seen or heard from her since the morning of 10-27-14. Duke said
               she tried texting Katherine approximately 1 hour prior to my
               arrival and she has yet to hear from her. I left my business
               card at the apartment and asked the roommates to have Katherine
               call me when they heard from her. I responded back to the WSU
               Police Department. Upon my arrival at the Police Department, I
               received a phone call from Debbie Templeton. She was crying and
               very concerned for her daughter's safety. I told her what I had
               done and advised we would have Officers continue checking her
               apartment during the evening. I told her we would call her as
               soon as we had contact with her daughter. Debbie asked if we
               had seen her vehicle parked near her apartment and I told her I
               was not informed of a vehicle. She didn't have much information
               about the car, but said I could contact Katherine's father to
               find out more information about the car. Just after I hung up
               with Debbie, I received word from the WSU Police Department
               front desk staff Katherine had contacted her father and was
               fine. I called Debbie back and she said she had also just
               received word her daughter was fine. She apologized for being

               who contacted her in Holland Library. She said everything was

               Pulgarin a ride to 430 NE Kamiaken Street where his car was

               Victim/Pedestrian: Holly J. Leendertsen WITNESS(ES):Grant
               Trobridge NARRATIVE: On 10-27-14 I was in the vehicle bay of
               the WSU Police Department when a Holly Leendertsen walked up to
               me and told me she had been struck by a vehicle in the
               crosswalk. She was very shaken up so I had her come into the
               conference room and sit down. I called for medics to come check
               her out. While waiting for the medics she said she walked up to
               the crosswalk at the intersection of Stadium Way and North
               Fairway. She said she pushed the crosswalk button, check to see
               if any cars were coming, then proceeded to cross the road east
               bound. She was looking down at her phone when she started to
               cross the road. She had made about 3 steps when all of a sudden
               a white Jeep Cherokee with a cougar logo on the rear drivers
               side came from North Fairway, across Stadium Way heading sound
               bound. The vehicle immediately came into the lane that
               Leendertsen was walking in. She jumped back, but not in time.
               The Cherokee's pass anger side rear mirror struck both her arms
               at the elbow. She said she stepped back onto the sidewalk and
               the Cherokee stopped. A college age blonde female exited and
               contacted her. She asked if she was all right and Leendertsen
               said she seem to be fine. She told me that at that time she
               thinks she was in shock about what had happen. She said the
               driver said ok, got back into her vehicle and left the scene. I
               asked if she got her name and she said he didn't even think of
               it until it was too late. She did remember that the vehicle had
               Washington Plates, but that was it. She said a Grant Trobridge
               gave her his number and told her he had seen it all. Pullman
               Fire Medics arrived and checked Leendertsten's injuries. They
               determined she didn't need to go to the hospital, but if things
               got worse to see a doctor. I photographed the injuries. There
               was visible reddening on both elbows. On her left elbow there
               was a dime size abrasion that had been bleeding. I down loaded
               the images into the case. I told Leendertsen that if the
               injuries got more visible I would like to take more photos. I
               told her to come in and an officer would take them. I told her
               I would contact Trobridge and try to find the vehicle. I called
               Trobridge and left a message for him to call me. More to

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: BRW/325 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W4382 SYNOPSIS: RA's called in a male who
               was acting odd and may be overdosing on marijuana. One subject
               contacted and he was cleared by medics. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               1. Tichun X. Aipperspach 06/09/95 Contacted 2. NARRATIVE: On
               10/28/14 at approximately 2106 hours, Sgt. Griffin and I
               responded to an overdose call at Goldsworthy Hall on the 5th
               floor. Dispatch stated that RA's were attempting to control a
               male that might be overdosing on marijuana. Upon arrival I
               found the RA's who were standing with a male, Tichun Xaivier
               Aipperspach 06/09/95, near the elevators on the floor. I asked
               Tichun what was going on. Tichun said nothing was. I asked if
               he had smoked marijuana recently and he said he had smoked
               about a bowl an hour ago. I asked Tichun a series of questions
               to determine his mental status. Tichun was able to answer all
               my questions correctly. While speaking to Tichun I noticed that
               while he spoke he kept gasping for breath. I asked Tichun if he
               fell short of breath and he said no. I asked Tichun if how he
               felt currently was how he normally reacts to marijuana. Tichun
               said yes it was about normal. Once medics arrived they
               evaluated Tichun and determined that Tichun did not need
               medical treatment. The medics cleared and I asked Tichun where
               he lived. Tichun said he lives in Rogers Hall and was at
               Goldsworthy Hall to meet a friend. I asked Tichun where his
               friend was and he said he did not know. I told Tichun that he
               was not allowed to be in the building unless escorted by a
               resident. I walked Tichun out of the building and told him it
               was probably a good idea to go home. Wile escorting Tichun out
               of the building, Sgt. Griffin walked the 4th and 5th floors to
               make sure there was nothing else going on. Sgt. Griffin radioed
               that it was all quiet on both floors. I returned to Sgt.
               Griffin who was interviewing Destany Ann Burke 05/19/96. Burke
               said she lives on the 5th floor of Goldsworthy Hall. Burke said
               she heard a commotion on the 4th floor from her room. Burke
               went to the 4th floor to see what was going on and she saw
               Tichun. Burke said she did not see what happened but she
               believes that someone was telling Tichun to leave. Burke said
               she does not know who was involved. Once Sgt. Griffin's
               interview was complete, we cleared. END OF REPORT I certify and

               of marijuana coming from room 729 of Rogers Hall. Upon my
               arrival I stepped onto the floor and immediately noticed the
               odor of marijuana hanging in the air. As I approached room 729
               I smelled the crack of the door and was only able to detect
               what smelled like dirty laundry coming from within the room.
               Upon listening at the door I heard no sound of movement from
               within the room and knocked. I again heard no movement from
               within the room and the door was not answered at which point I
               contacted the reporting party, Aubrie L Piper (112987). I
               explained what I had smelled and heard from the room and asked
               if the owners were in the room. I was told the owners had not
               been seen, but several people had been seen going in and out of
               that room as well as others on the floor during this period. I
               told Piper based upon what I had observed I was not going to
               write a search warrant at this time, but if the problem
               continued to give me a call. She told me that would be fine and
               I cleared a short time later. Nothing further. I certify and

               NARRATIVE: ON 10-27-14 I was dispatched to a theft that had
               occurred in Goldsworthy Hall. I responded to the basement of
               the hall where the R/P a Macy Milnes was studying. She stated
               that at 2100 hours last night she put her backpack on her chair
               and want to bed. Tonight at 2130 hours she was at WalMart
               buying groceries when she noticed the money was gone. She said
               she was in and out of her room all day and the door was un-
               locked. She said at 1730 she took her backpack to the Kappa
               Sigma sorority for an event. She put her back pack in a members
               and picked it up a short time later. I asked if she thought her
               roommate my have taken the money. She said she gets along with
               her roommate and didn't think she would do it. I asked if there
               was anyone else? She said that some of her sorority sisters
               were having money problems, but didn't know. I told her to put
               the word out to the hall and sorority members about the theft.
               Usually people slip up and brag about having more money. She
               said she would and told me she would let me know if she heard
               anything. After I left the hall I contacted Sgt. Dornes from
               Pullman PD. I told him of the possible theft in his
               jurisdiction. I told him I would notify his agency if I found
               out that the theft had occurred there. He said that was fine
               and we ended the call. There are no leads or suspects at this
               time. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the

               of marijuana. Upon my arrival I noticed the odor in the hallway

               and it was answered by a female, later identified as Katelyn M
               Humpries (012396). As Humpries and I initially spoke I noticed
               the odor of marijuana coming from inside of the room and asked
               her if she knew why I was talking to her. She told me she
               didn't know, but once I explained it was due to the odor she
               told us we could come into the room. Once inside of her room
               Humpries offered to turn over her remaining marijuana. We spoke
               for a brief period of time at which point she agreed to destroy

               Gulstrom 12/26/96 Protective Custody Suicide Attempt 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 10/27/14 at approximately 2322 hours I was
               dispatched to a suicide attempt call at Rogers Hall room 728.
               Dispatch stated that the RED on duty, Hannah M. Mitchell, was
               with, Phillip H. Happe-Hartsell 05/31/95, who had information
               about a female who was going to commit suicide. I responded to
               Hartsell's dorm room, Rogers Hall, room 723. Hartsell invited
               me in. I asked Hartsell what was going on. Hartsell stated that
               he has a friend named, Cienna K. Paet-Gulstrom 12/26/96.
               Hartsell and Gulstrom had been semi-dating for the first two
               weeks of October. About two weeks ago Hartsell and Gulstrom
               were walking back to their dorm from the Greek Row area when
               Gulstrom told Hartsell that she wanted to kill herself.
               Hartsell said he tried to get Gulstrom help the best he could.
               Hartsell said he did not ask Gulstrom how she planned on
               killing herself because he did not want to know. Hartsell
               stated that he kept in touch with Gulstrom over the next two
               weeks via text messaging until tonight when at approximately
               2200 hours when Gulstrom came over to Hartsell's room. Gulstrom
               gave Hartsell a stack of envelopes addressed to several people.
               Gulstrom asked Hartsell to hand out the envelopes "when she was
               gone." Hartsell said Gulstrom then left but did not tell him
               where she was going. Hartsell stated he found the envelope
               addressed to him and read the letter inside. Hartsell stated
               the letter appeared to be a suicide note. After a while
               Hartsell decided to tell his RA who Gulstrom had also written a
               letter to. After talking with Hartsell for a while, Hartsell
               was able to tell me that Gulstrom drives a dark blue Ford
               Explorer with a Hawaii sticker in the back window. I asked if
               Gulstrom had any other close friends that she might seek out.
               Hartsell stated that Gulstrom often hangs out with "Justin" who
               lives in a Farmhouse Fraternity live out. Hartsell stated that
               Gulstrom often parks her car there. I asked Hartsell if I could
               take the notes and he handed them to me. There were 15
               envelopes addressed to first names only and a generalized
               address. There was also one envelope that was addressed to
               Gulstrom's mother. I quickly read a few notes and they were
               essentially goodbye letters to her friends. I provided Hartsell
               with my business card and the non-emergency number for dispatch

               and asked him to call if Gulstrom contacted him. I walked down
               the hall to Gulstrom's room 728. I could hear music playing in
               the room and I knocked on the door. Nobody answered my knocks
               and I was unable to hear any movement coming from the room. Due
               to the life and death nature of this call I asked the RED on
               duty, Mitchell, to key into the room. Mitchell handed me the
               master key and I announced I was coming in. I opened the door
               and entered the room to check for Gulstrom. I found nobody
               inside the room. On Gulstrom's bed I found her cell phone
               connected to a charger. In an attempt to find Gulstrom I went
               through her cell phone looking for clues to where she might be.
               Gulstrom had not contacted anybody since around 1900 hours.
               None of her text messages lead to her whereabouts. I asked Ofc.
               Welter to respond to the area of Farmhouse to see if he could
               find Gulstrom's Explorer. With the assistance of Ofc.
               Winegardner of the Pullman Police Department, Ofc. Welter was
               able to locate Gulstrom Explorer behind 675 NE Opal St. Ofc.
               Welter knocked on the door of *********** and confirmed
               Gulstrom was inside (see Ofc. Welter's supplement for further
               details). Upon arrival at 675 NE Opal St. I entered the house
               and found Ofc. Welter handcuffing Gulstrom for protective
               custody. Standing next to Ofc. Welter was Justin Chu Moore
               11/15/95. Moore and Gulstrom had been playing beer pong. Ofc.
               Welter informed me that Gulstrom had a fresh cut to her wrist
               and it was bandaged up. I walked Gulstrom to my patrol car
               which was in the Community Congregation Church parking lot.
               Gulstrom asked why she was under arrest and I explained that
               she was in protective custody. I asked Gulstrom what was going
               on with her. Gulstrom stated that a week ago she was diagnosed
               with bipolar disorder by her psychiatrist. Gulstrom said, "I
               wanted to end my life today." Gulstrom said she just wanted to
               get notes to her friends before she killed herself. I asked
               Gulstrom if she had a plan on how she was going to kill
               herself. Gulstrom said she did but did not want to tell me how
               she was going to do it. Gulstrom stated that she did not want
               to live with the bipolar disorder any longer. I transported
               Gulstrom to Pullman Regional Hospital. While en route to the
               hospital Gulstrom asked if I was going to call her mother. I
               told Gulstrom I did not know if I was required to or not but I
               would check into it. Gulstrom begged me not to call her mother
               or step father because of issues among the family. Gulstrom
               also stated that the medicine that she had been given was not
               helping her and she wanted medicine that would make her not
               want to kill herself. Gulstrom also said she had been seeing a
               counselor from WSU counseling services for a while now. I asked
               Gulstrom about her bandaged wrist. Gulstrom said she had cut
               it. I asked Gulstrom if she had attempted to kill herself
               earlier and she said no she was just in a "mood." Gulstrom said
               she had cut her wrist earlier in the night. Once at PRH,
               Gulstrom was unhandcuffed and turned over to medical staff. I
               returned to the station and made copies of the suicide notes
               and provided PRH with copies. As I read through the notes, most
               notes were goodbye letters thanking the person for being
               Gulstrom's friend. One note instructed the person that they
               could have her TV from her room. Inside the envelope addressed
10/28/14         Washington State University Police Department               292

               to her mother was 27 copies of the same suicide note and
               instructions for her mother to pass them out to the rest of her
               family. I made copies of the suicide notes and uploaded them to
               the files folder. The physical notes will be logged into
               evidence. Ofc. Welter stated that Justin Moore had asked for me
               to call him when I knew what was going to happen to Gulstrom. I
               caled Moore and told him that Gulstrom was checked into the
               hospital to get some help. Moore said the he wanted me to know
               that it was very important that I not call Gulstrom's mother or
               step father. Moore said Gulstrom has been physically abused by
               her mother in the past and it would be very bad for Gulstrom's
               mother to find out about tonight. Moore also stated that
               Gulstrom's father had not been in the picture for a long time.
               Moore asked when he could talk to Gulstrom and I told him that
               she would contact him when she was ready to do so. Due to both
               Gulstrom and Moore's statements about Gulstrom's it was decided
               that it would be best not to contact Moore's mother. This case
               will be referred to WSU counseling services. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               28th day of October, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.
