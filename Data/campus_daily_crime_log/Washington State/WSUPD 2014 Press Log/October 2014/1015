               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W4124 10/15/14 SYNOPSIS: Suspicious
               package found in landscaping area near Grimes and Stadium Way.
               Determined to be an empty milk container used in Human's vs.
               Zombies. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE:
               On October 15, 2014 at about 0801 hours I was dispatched to the
               area of the veterinary statue near Grimes and Stadium Way.
               Someone had seen a male with a beard placing a jug in that area
               and walking away. I responded to the area. I located a one
               gallon milk jug in the flower/landscaping area next to the
               statue. The opaque jug appeared to be empty. There was a piece
               of bright orange tape wrapped around the jug. Someone had used
               a black marker and wrote "Property of HVZ Do Not Remove". I
               called WSU Environmental Health Services and they were not
               aware of anyone doing research using milk jugs. Assistant Chief
               Hansen determined the abbreviation "HVZ" to mean Human's vs.
               Zombies. This is a sanctioned event that is occurring on the
               WSU campus. Upon further inspection the milk jug was found to
               be empty. I disposed of it in a nearby recycling container.
               Assistant Chief Hansen will contact the Human's vs. Zombies
               organizers regarding the suspicious item. No further
               investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 15th day of October, 2014, in

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W4146 SYNOPSIS: Charges forwarded to PA
               on two males for Minor Exhibiting In Public Place. Both were
               warned for urinating in public. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Brendan J. McCauley Charges Forwarded Minor
               Exhibiting 2. Carter J. Shirreff Charges Forwarded Minor
               Exhibiting NARRATIVE: On 10-16-14 at approximately 0026 hours,
               I was traveling on Colorado St near D St when I observed two
               males who appeared to be acting suspicious. One of the males
               appeared to be hiding in the bushes near the entrance to
               Parking Services at the D St side and the other was standing
               near the soccer field fence like a look out. I drove passed the
               two and turned around. As I drove back to the area, I observed
               the male near the soccer field now had his back to me and was
               urinating in public. The other male was still near the bushes
               and also appeared to be urinating in public. I stopped my
               vehicle and exited to contact them. The male at the soccer
               field zipped up his pants and turned to walk away. He yelled
               something at the other male. I activated my axon camera as I
               exited my vehicle. I asked him for his identification and he
               provided his WA Driver's License. He was identified as Brendan
               McCauley. As I was speaking to him, the other male approached
               and I asked him for his identification as well. He handed me
               his Cougar Card and I asked him if he had a driver's license.
               He provided his WA Driver's License and was identified as
               Carter Shirreff. As I spoke to both males, I observed the odor
               of intoxicants emitting from their breaths. They were also
               swaying in a circular motion while standing. I asked them how
               much they had to drink and Carter stated none. Brendan did not
               respond. I looked at Carter's eyes and observed his pupils were
               extremely dilated. I asked them both how old they were and
               Carter stated he was 19 and Brendan stated he was 18. I pulled
               Carter to the side and spoke with him. As he spoke, I could
               smell the odor of intoxicants emitting from his breath get
               stronger. I also observed he was still swaying and his speech
               was slurred. He also had slow deliberate movements. He told me
               several times he had just been eating a bagel at his fraternity
               and had not been drinking. I asked what he was doing in the
               bushes and he said just waiting for Brendan. I asked to look at
               his eyes and observed he had a lack of smooth pursuit before
               stopping as he was moving his head. I asked him if he would
               take a PBT test and he said yes. As I was getting a breath tube
               from my vehicle, he stated he wanted to be honest and admitting
               to having four or five beers. I administered the breath test

               and a reading of .108 was observed on PBT s/n: 049029 which was
               in normal operating range. I asked him what he had been doing
               in the bushes and he said he had been urinating. I then asked
               Brendan if he was willing to take a PBT test and he said yes.
               The first time he attempted to provide a breath sample he
               didn't exhale. I coached him on how to properly provide a
               sample and on the third try, I observed a reading of .111.
               While speaking with Brendan, I observed the odor of intoxicants
               grew stronger as he spoke and his speech was slurred. I also
               observed he kept repeating himself stating they were just going
               home. He stated he wasn't really that drunk and I advised him
               he had drawn my attention by urinating in public and the
               alcohol probably contributed to that decision. He stated he has
               urinated in public when he has been sober. I advised both
               Carter and Brendan I would be forwarding charges to the
               Prosecutor's Office for Minor Exhibiting in a Public Place. I
               also advised them I would be sending their information to
               Student Conduct. They stated they understood. I issued both of
               them a verbal warning for urinating in public. I cleared. I
               later downloaded my video to the S: drive. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               16th day of October, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.
