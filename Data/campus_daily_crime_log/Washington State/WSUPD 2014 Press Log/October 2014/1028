               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W4399 SYNOPSIS: Request for a welfare
               check. Subject was found to be currently receiving medical
               treatment. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 102814 around 2006 hrs I was dispatched to a
               request for a welfare check on a female, Cienna K Paet Gulstrom
               (121696), who had been transported to Pullman Regional Hospital
               (PRH) early on 102814 by WSU Police Officers (See Case #: 14-
               W4387). I contacted the reporting party, Justin C Moore
               (111595), and was told the following. Moore explained Gulstrom
               had been transported to PRH by officers and has not heard from
               her since. I told Moore I had been one of the officer that had
               dealt with Gulstrom. He continued and told me he had been
               concerned because she had not been back to her room and her
               vehicle with her belongings was still parked behind 675 NE Opal
               St, where it was located when she had been picked up. I
               confirmed he had not heard anything from Gulstrom and he told
               me that was correct. He also added he had been in contact with
               her roommate, Laine E Ball (052896), and she had not seen her
               either. According to Moore, Ball told him it appeared as though
               Gulstrom had not been back to the room and he cell phone and
               items were still as we had found them earlier in the evening on
               102714. After a brief conversation with Moore I explained if
               she did not want to speak with anyone right now then she didn't
               have to. I continued and told him I would check into it and if
               I found out anything I'd let him know. Prior to concluding my
               conversation with him I asked him to give me a call if he heard
               from or saw Gulstrom. He told me he would and we concluded our
               call a short time later. After speaking with Moore I contacted
               Whitcom who told me Gulstrom had been released from PRH in the
               morning of 102814, but she did not know at what time. I thanked
               them for the help and contacted PRH. I was told Gulstrom had
               been released at 0905 hrs and when I asked who had picked her
               up they did not know and transferred me to the emergency
               department. Upon speaking with them I explained that I had been
               contacted over concerns for her safety and had learned she had
               been released and was curious to whom. After a brief
               conversation I was told she had not been released, but had been
               transported to Kootenai Medical Center and was given a contact
               phone number for them. I thanked him and contacted Kootenai
               Medical Center. Upon reaching them I was told Gulstrom was
               still there and had not been released. I thanked them for their
               time and contacted Moore. Upon reaching him I explained
               Gulstrom was safe and although I could not discuss anything

               further there was no need to be concerned for her safety at
               this point. Moore thanked me and we concluded our call and I
               cleared this call a short time later. Nothing further. I

               Warned Poss < 40 Grams NARRATIVE: On 10-28-14 at approximately
               2143 hours, Ofc. Westerman and I responded to Stephenson North
               room 907 for the report of the odor of marijuana emitting from
               the room. As I exited the elevator, the odor became stronger. I
               knocked on the door and could see movement inside through the
               peep hole. I could also hear banging, like someone hiding
               items. After about a minute, the door was open and I observed
               the odor of marijuana was emitting from inside the room. I
               could see three males sitting in the room and I asked them if
               anyone was a medical marijuana patient. They all said no. I
               asked how old they were and they all said under 21 years of
               age. I asked who the room belonged to and Sanders and Challinor
               stated it was theirs. I advised them to retrieve all of the
               marijuana, and items used to smoke it from the room. They began
               pulling things out. I also advised them to pull out any alcohol
               they may have in their refrigerator. The males pulled out a
               bong, water pipe, several bong stems with residue in the bowl,
               a container of hash, a blow tube, a scale, and a mason jar
               containing a plastic bag with approximately 8 grams of
               marijuana. They also removed an unopened can of beer, and three
               bottles of hard alcohol. I asked who the marijuana belonged to
               and they stated it was all of theirs. I escorted them out to
               the garbage dumpsters where they disposed of the items. I
               advised them I would be forwarding their information to Student
               Conduct and they stated they understood. We cleared. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.

               approximately 0024 hours, I was dispatched to a welfare check
               at Perham Hall room 414. Dispatch stated that Harbor View
               Medical Center called stating that they had just spoken to a
               Andrew J. Suver 12/13/95 who had just consumed marijuana and
               gummy bears. Harbor View believed that Suver might be
               experiencing side effects. Upon arrival I contacted Suver who
               said he had smoked earlier in the night but the real problem
               was that he ate 8 gummy bear multivitamins. Suver said he had
               blurry vision for a few minutes but he was better now. Once
               medics arrived they evaluated Suver and determined he was going
               to be just fine. Medics and I cleared shortly thereafter. END

               On 10/29/14 at approximately 0231 hours I responded to
               Northside Hall room 482 where Dylan Edward Connor 09/23/95 was

               filled a cup with blood. Upon arrival I contacted Connor who
               was standing in the hallway of the 4th floor. Connor was
               spitting blood into a solo cup which was about 1/4 full. Connor
               said he had just been to the doctor earlier in the day and they
               told him he had strep throat. Connor said he was feeling fine
               other than spitting up blood. Once medics arrived they
               determined that Connor had cut one of his tonsils. Medics told
               Connor that he should see a doctor about the beading and Connor
               stated he would have a friend take him. The medics and I
               cleared shortly thereafter. END OF REPORT I certify and declare
