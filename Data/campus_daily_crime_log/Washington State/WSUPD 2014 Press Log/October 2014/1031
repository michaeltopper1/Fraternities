    Narrative: RVWD: 316 / OFC: Olmstead/339 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY
               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W4461 SYNOPSIS: Jeff Nepute (DOB
               05-28-1986) requested a welfare check on Cienna K. Paet
               Gulstrom (DOB 12-26-1996). NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR#
               1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 10-31-2014 at about 1021 hrs I was
               dispatched to a request for a welfare check. I contacted the
               complainant, Jeff Nepute (DOB 05-28-1986), on the telephone.
               Nepute is a psychologist for WSU Counseling Services. Nepute
               advised that he was concerned about one of his patients, who
               was identified as Cienna K. Paet Gulstrom (DOB 12-26-1996).
               Nepute advised that Gulstrom has been suicidal and missed two
               appointments this week. Nepute requested a welfare check for
               Gulstrom. I checked Spillman and determined that Gulstrom was
               recently contacted by law enforcement, see cases 14-W4387 and
               14-W4399. After reviewing the information is these two cases, I
               learned that Gulstrom had been taken into protective custody
               and admitted to the Kootenai Medical Center in Coeur d'Alene,
               Idaho. I provided this information to Nepute, and after
               considering the situation, he advised that a welfare check was
               not needed at this time. Nepute said he would follow-up with
               Gulstrom, and he would contact the police department if he
               decided a welfare check was needed at a later date. No further
               action at this time. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this __31__ day

               taken into protective custody at WSU Counseling Services. Male
               transported to Pullman Regional Hospital for evaluation and
               treatment. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On October 31, 2014 at about 1431 hours Officer
               Olmstead and I responded to WSU Counseling Services for a
               welfare check. Upon our arrival we were met by WSU Counseling
               staff. They told us a male patient had come to their clinic. He
               was acting suicidal, paranoid, and very upset. Staff said he
               needed to go to Pullman Regional Hospital for an evaluation.
               Officer Olmstead and I contacted and identified the male as
               Krihna Yadav (06/02/90). Yadav is a citizen of India and WSU
               graduate student in mechanical engineering. I told Yadav that
               we were there to help him and he needed to go to the hospital.
               He agreed that he should go. I searched Yadav for weapons and
               walked him to my patrol vehicle. I transported him to the
               hospital without incident. While enroute to the hospital he
               told me many things, among them were: There is tension/divide
               between the Indians and Bangladeshi's His instructor took away
               the attendance sign up sheet He has been a spice user since
               January, but stopped on October 17, 2014 He believes unknown
               people hacked into his wireless router He believes unknown
               people are posting that he is "gay" on Facebook He got on a
               transit bus and everyone got off the bus because they think he
               is gay Spice is the devil's drug He told people that he was
               going to commit suicide Yadav quickly rambled on about these
               topics. He admitted to having an anger problem due to his spice
               withdrawals. He said he has not eaten for a couple of days.
               There was a strong body odor coming from Yadav that was easily
               detected Yadav was not acting normal. Per RCW 71.05.150 I
               turned custody of Yadav over to Pullman Regional Hospital for
               the purposes of determining treatment needs as he appeared to
               be suffering from a mental disorder and presents an imminent
               likelihood of serious harm to others, or to himself, or is in
               imminent danger because of being gravely disabled. No further
               investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 31st day of October, 2014, in

               CITE/SECTOR# 1.Unknown 2. NARRATIVE: On 10-31014 I was
               contacted by Intern Whitney Fairbanks. She showed me a post
               that had just occurred on a social Internet site called Yick
               Yack. The person stated the following. "Pavilion is about to
               get shot up tonight...heads up people" Later this evening there
               is a Hip Hop concert scheduled to start at 2200 and ending at
               0130. I contacted Assistant Chief Hansen about the post and we
               discussed the situation. The plan was to contact the organizers
               of the event and go from there. I went to Ensminger Pavilion
               and contacted Mataeo Strothers. I showed him the post. We
               discussed the concerns I had about continuing the event.
               Strothers stated that he was not going to cancel the event. I
               advised him against it but he was adamant the event continue.
               We discussed the event and how we could improve the security. I
               loaned them the departments hand wand metal detector and
               assigned 4 Cougar Security units to the event. I called Hansen
               and told him of the plans. During the event there was several
               fights but no shots were fired. I did some research on Yick
               Yack. The site is a national site that college students use as
               an anonymous way for students to post things/thoughts or
               feeling. To obtain information about origin of posts you would
               need a search warrant. There are no leads or suspects at this

               WITNESS(ES):None NARRATIVE: On 10-31-14 I was dispatched to
               assist Pullman Police Department with a non-injury collision
               involving one of their patrol cars. I responded to Markley
               Drive near the Red Bento Restaurant. Upon my arrival I could
               see a patrol car and a ford focus sitting on Markley with their
               front ends touching. The patrol car was in the northbound side
               of Markley facing north(in it's proper lane of travel). The
               Focus was facing southwest as if it was exiting the Red Bento
               parking lot. I contacted the drivers Guo and Emerson. I asked
               them if either one were injured and they both said they were
               un-injured. I asked Guo what happen. She stated she was exiting
               the parking lot attempting to go south on Markley Drive. She
               looked to the right for traffic then proceeded. When she looked
               to the left up Markley Drive she saw the patrol vehicle. By the
               time she saw the patrol car it was to late she struck the
               patrol car. I asked her for her information and she gave it to
               me. I asked Emerson when had happen. He stated that he was
               traveling northbound on Markley when the focus came out of the
               parking lot. He said the driver was looking right down Markley.
               She didn't see him coming and exited the parking lot striking
               his vehicle. I did not write any infractions in this case. I
               did warn Guo about failing to yield to the right of way. She
               under stood and told me she would be better about looking for
               traffic. I photographed the scene and damage to both vehicles.
               Both vehicle were driveble so after the photos were taken we
               all left the scene. I returned to the department and down

               detained and taken to PRH by medics. No action. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 103114 at
               approximately 2222 hours Interns Carey and Nguyen reported a
               Disorderly subject near WSU Parking. Asst. Chief Hansen and I
               responded. I stopped my vechicle at the intersection of Thatuna
               and Colorado. I got out of my vehicle and saw a struggle on the
               sidewalk towards D St. Intern Carey appeared to be on top of
               Matthew P. Obando (061295). I reported a fight over the air and
               ran to the two. I did not notice what Intern Nguyen was doing.
               Carey had Obando's left arm behind his back. I put Obando in
               handcuffs and informed him he was being detained until I
               figured out what was going on. I asked Carey what Obando had
               done and he explained Obando had been intoxicated, had an open
               container, and had run from them. I got Obando up to a sitting
               position. Obando was obviously intoxicated due to his slurred
               speech, odor of intoxicants on his breath, and lack of balance.
               He eventually vomitted. I told Obando I was going to take him
               out of handcuffs. I did so and he instantly ran towards the
               street. Asst. Chief Hansen pinned him against the hood of his
               patrol car. Obando was placed back in handcuffs and sat back
               down to await Medics as I noticed Obando had blood on his right
               ear and abrasions on his face. He had a swollen right eyebrow.
               Obando provided me with a breath sample that was a .261. Medics
               responded and took him to PRH via ambulance not in our custody.
               I instructed the Interns to go directly to the station and
               begin writing statements. I followed the ambulance to PRH to
               get pictures of Obando's face as I could not get good ones in
               the light on the street. Obando had mentioned he had been
               approaching other people on the street and may have had
               altercations with them. After the hospital I returned to the
               station and met with the Interns. They had not started writing
               statements but said they had been going over the event in their
               heads. I had them sit down and write down statements. See case
               file. Approximately 3-4 hours later I was driving on Stadium
               Way and came across Obando walking in the middle of the street.
               I spoke with him on Flag Ln. He had no recollection of me and
               told me he had been drinking at the Grove and his friend took
               him to the hospital as he was not feeling well but he felt good
               now. I told him to go inside as he was still intoxicated.
               Intern Coordinator Ofc. Stewart was notified of the event.
               Nothing follows. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W4492 SYNOPSIS: Cited and released
               Ruchelle Jack for Obstruction. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Ruchell D. Jack (060894) Cite/Release
               Obstruction 4Z0332225 2. NARRATIVE: On 110114 at approximately
               0023 hours I was at Ensminger Pavilion for an event. Cougar
               Security informed me that there was a fight inside the
               building. I entered and saw approximately 8 people fighting. I
               approached and separated the one person I saw swinging punches,
               Ruchell D. Jack (060894), from the group. I attempted to take
               hold of Jack but he pushed off me with his right arm and began
               running out of the building. I was trying to get ahold of him
               and instructing him to get on the ground. He reached the stairs
               and with me on his back he went to the ground. My camera was
               knocked off in the event. I got hold of one of his arms but had
               to repeatedly tell him to bring his other arm behind him. I
               could smell the odor of intoxicants on his breath. Without
               asking, Jack told me he was trying to break the fight up. I
               read him his rights. He first said he did not understand his
               rights. When asked repeatedly if he understood his rights he
               said he guess he did. The fight seemed to dissipate once Jack
               was outside. Jack stated he did not mean to push me away as he
               thought I was someone involved with the fight, however, my
               video shows him looking at me prior to him pushing me away.
               Additionally, Jack and I have met several times previously. I
               told Jack he was under arrest for Obstruction. He was searched
               and placed in the back of my patrol car. The only item removed
               from him was a key lanyard that I gave to a female Jack
               directed me to. In the car, Jack stated his eyes were red
               because he had a medicinal marijuana card. I offered him a PBT
               and he declined. I was not able to identify any victim of
               Jack's punches. I warned him for assault 3rd on me. He accused
               his Probation Officer of being racist. He then stated I was
               racist but only towards him. I completed Sector citation
               4Z0332225 for Obstruction and issued it to Jack. I released him
               and instructed him to leave the event. I cleared. Nothing
               follows. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W4502 SYNOPSIS: Intoxicated female with
               possible cuts on body near Gannon Hall. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 11/1/14 at about 0301 hours
               Officer Petlovany and I responded to a call of an intoxicated
               female with cuts all over her body running along Stadium Way
               near Gannon Hall. The female was located behind Wagner Hall at
               its' loading dock. The female was very intoxicated, but the
               only injury on her body that could be seen was a small scratch
               on a knuckle on her right hand. The female identified herself
               as Abigail A. Harrison, 10/24/95, and she was very panicky
               because she could find Abigail. She was later identified as
               Corina R. Miller, 05/15/96. Miller did not know where she was,
               and believed she had just been at a party inside of Wagner
               Hall. She was very persistent that she needed to find Abigail.
               She was constantly crying because she did not want to go to
               jail even though she was told numerous times she was not going
               to jail. When asked where she lived she would rattle off an
               address we could just partly understand, and what we could
               understand we knew it was not an address in Pullman. Miller
               provided a phone number (509)294-7601, but it went directly to
               a voice message asking us to leave a message for the number
               dialed. Miller provided a breath sample and a PBT reading of
               .266 was observed. When medics arrived Miller was placed into
               Protective Custody and transported to the hospital. It was when
               Miller was being transported she told the EMTs her name was
               Corina Miller, not Abigail Harrison. The hospital was able to
               pull up medical information on Corina Miller. A Protective
               Custody form was completed. Nothing further at this time. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this ____ day of _____________, 2014, in
