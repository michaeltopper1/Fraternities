               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W4424 10/30/14 SYNOPSIS: Report of a
               disorderly subject on a bicycle near the EEME loading dock.
               Unable to locate disorderly subject. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On October 30, 2014 at about 1050
               hours I was dispatched to a third party report of a disorderly
               subject at the EEME loading dock. Sgt. Macy and I responded to
               the area. I contacted Thomas C. Senter (01/21/66) at this
               location. He told me he was cursed and yelled at by an unknown
               male on a bicycle. The unknown male was not on scene. Senter
               works for WSU Central Receiving. He was driving his work
               vehicle, a large white step van. Senter was driving south out
               of the EEME loading dock area. He was stopped in the roadway as
               another WSU vehicle was traveling in the opposite direction.
               There is not much room as this is a small driveway access. As
               the two (2) WSU vehicles were carefully passing each other an
               unknown male on a bicycle rode up. The male began yelling and
               cursing at Senter. Telling him to move his vehicle because he
               has to go to work. The male somehow managed to ride between the
               two (2) vehicles. Senter exited his vehicle and repeatedly
               asked the man for his name. The male got off of his bike near
               the EEME loading dock, walked inside and went in an unknown
               direction. Senter told me he had an encounter with this same
               person about a year and half (1.5) ago to two (2) years ago.
               Senter reported the incident to the police at that time. Police
               were unable to locate or identify the male at that time. Senter
               described the angry bicyclist at a white male with short black
               hair, about 6 feet tall, and a thin to medium build. Senter
               told me he would recognize the man if he saw him again. He
               believes he works in Sloan, EEME, or Dana. Senter has seen him
               in those buildings as he was delivering his packages. There was
               no physical confrontation, only verbal by the bicyclist. Senter
               reported the incident to his supervisor. Senter and I walked
               through the buildings but were unable to locate the man. No
               further investigation at this time. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 30th day of

               accident in the Green parking lot just south of Daggy Hall.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: Driver 1:

               policy #00563 96 21U 7101 1 On 10/30/14 at about 1329 hours I
               arrived at a two vehicle, non injury, accident in the Green
               parking lot just south of Daggy Hall. I contacted the drivers
               Baker and Nelson, and determined no one was injured. Asking
               what happened Baker tells me she had backed out of a stall a
               few feet, came to a stop, and then Nelson's vehicle scraped her
               vehicle's rear bumper. I asked Baker if she had moved her
               vehicle forward a couple of feet since the accident, Baker said
               she had not. Nelson said she had pulled a couple feet forward,
               and it appeared by damage locations on the vehicles, and the
               vehicles locations, Baker had moved her vehicle forward after
               the collision. Baker later admitted she may have pulled forward
               a little after the collision, but she did not remember doing
               so. Nelson tells me he was driving through the parking lot when
               the right side of his vehicle was struck. Nelson said he came
               to an immediate stop, and has not moved his vehicle since. The
               damage to Baker's vehicle was to the middle area of the rear
               bumper. The damage to Nelson's vehicle was to the area just in
               front of the right rear wheel well. It appears the vehicles
               just grazed each other making most of the damage to each
               vehicle to be paint transfer. Considering vehicles placement on
               my arrival, and the damage location on each vehicle, it appears
               Baker was backing out of the parking stall, not seeing Nelson
               approaching from the west, and makes contact with Nelson's
               vehicle. Photos were taken and placed into the case.
               Information was exchanged between Baker and Nelson. Baker was
               not issued an infraction. No further at this time. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.

               later identified as Emery S Smith (041995), who told me the

               custody and transported to PRH for evaluation. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Samantha A. Gottlieb protective custody
               2. NARRATIVE: On 10-30-14 at approximately 1645 hours, Ofc.
               Welter and I were dispatched to a suicide attempt at Stephenson
               North 613. We were advised CPR was in progress. I activated my
               Axon camera as I arrived at the hall. At the room we found the
               patient, Samantha, semi-conscious and breathing laying on the
               floor on her back. The boyfriend, Forrest, stated she had
               vomited a couple of times. I rolled her onto her side and held
               her there until medics arrived. While waiting, I tried to talk
               with her, but she wouldn't speak except for a very light
               whisper which I was unable to understand. She also tried
               several times to get up and I held her on the ground. I could
               see she had resting nystagmus and would go in and out of
               consciousness. Ofc. Welter spoke with Forrest in the hallway
               while I stayed with Samantha. Forrest stated they had purchased
               a box of Benadryl earlier in the day. He said they had been
               watching a movie and Samantha had left and gone to the
               restroom. After a while when she hadn't returned he went to
               check on her and found her semi-conscious and puking. He also
               noticed she had ingested the entire box of Benadryl, 48
               tablets. He stated she had issues with depression in the past,
               but didn't think she had been diagnosed or took any medications
               for it. I advised Samantha she was in protective custody.
               Medics placed her on the gurney and since she was combative she
               was placed in restraints. I accompanied her to PRH in the
               ambulance and held her arm with the IV down as she would hold
               it still. She was combative off and on all the way to the
               hospital, and seemed to not know what was going on. We talked
               to her several times about what was going on to try and calm
               her. At the hospital I assisted staff with transferring to the
               bed and the restraints were attached to the bed. I completed
               the Release of Adult Protective Custody which was signed by Dr.
               Bergmann. I cleared. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the

               NARRATIVE: On 10/31/14 at approximately 0254 hours, I heard
               Pullman Fire telling dispatch that they saw a possible
               intoxicated driver. Pullman Fire stated a silver and maroon
               Chevrolet truck had just pulled into the Scott Coman Parking
               area after hitting a curb. I responded to the area and found
               the truck near the Scott Coman turn around. There were several
               people exiting the truck as I pulled up. I walked up to a male
               who was locking up the truck. I told the male, later identified
               as Andrelle Jahmal Crawford 01/28/96, what had been reported to
               me by Pullman Fire. Crawford said he might have clipped the
               sidewalk at the intersection of Stadium Way and Cougar Way. I
               asked Crawford how much he had to drink tonight and he said
               none. I asked if I could look at his eyes and Crawford said I
               could. I performed an HGN test on Crawford and observed no
               clues of HGN. I also was unable to smell any odor of
               intoxicants coming from his breath. Believing that Crawford was
               not impaired, I thanked him for his time and cleared. END OF

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W4455 SYNOPSIS: Davin B. Valencia (09-25-
               95) entered two rooms in Gannon Hall; which were not his, and
               urinated in one of them. He was trespassed from Gannon and
               Goldsworthy Halls and charges will be forwarded to the

               Residential Burglary RCW 9A.48.090 Malicious Mischief III
               NARRATIVE: On 10-31-14, at approximately 0336 hours, I was
               dispatched to Gannon Hall, room 120 for a Urinating in Public
               call. Upon my arrival, I met with the Gannon Hall 1st floor
               Residential Advisor, Cody E. Mannick (04-09-94). I asked
               Mannick what I could do for her. She invited me into room 120
               where I also met Skylar R. Sampels (11-19-95), Leslie A. Olson
               (03-07-96) and Tessa D. Gomes (11-23-96). Sampels and Olson are
               the assigned occupants of room 120 and Gomes is a friend who
               was visiting from Bellevue. Gomes said she heard the room door
               open at approximately 0250 hours and a male entered the room.
               Gomes said she heard something sounding like the male was
               urinating. She reached over, got her cell phone, and turned on
               the flashlight function. She shined the light onto the male and
               could see he was urinating. She yelled at the male which caused
               Olson and Sampels to wake up. All of the women began yelling at
               the male saying things like "What are you doing? Get out of
               here. This isn't your room". The male; identified by Sampels
               and Olson as "Davin, who lives in the last room on the right",
               was only wearing gray boxer underwear. When the women began
               yelling he stopped urinating, pulled his boxers up, and began
               walking toward Sampels and Gomes. Olson jumped out of bed,
               turned the light on, and opened the room door. Gomes said she
               began pushing the male toward the door telling him to get out.
               Davin eventually exited the room. He then entered another
               female room on the first floor (136) which is also not his
               room. The two female occupants of this room helped Davin get
               back to his room (103). Sampels said Davin; who I later
               identified as Davin B. Valencia (09-29-95), urinated her gray
               pair of size 7 Ugg boots, the carpet in her room, a pair of
               Apple ear buds, on top of her desk, on her laptop computer bag,
               and on some text books which belong to Gomes. Sampels said she
               was going to try to wash her computer bag, but her ear buds and
               Ugg boots were ruined. She told me she had just purchased the
               ear buds for $30.00 and said the Ugg boots were approximately 6
               months old and worth $150.00. I went to room 103 and contacted

               Valencia. I asked him to come speak with me and he mumbled
               something to the effect of "What do you want now? I already
               talked with that lady RA." I said "I am not the lady RA, I am
               the Police." Valencia got out of bed and I asked him to come to
               the study lounge so we could talk. Once in the study lounge I
               asked Valencia if he knew why I was there and he said it was
               because he entered two rooms and urinated in one of them. He
               kept acting like what he did was no big deal. He said something
               to the effect of "What? I've already cleaned it up." He said he
               was totally embarrassed about what had happened. I asked him if
               he walks in his sleep. He said he talks in his sleep, but
               believes he had "Blacked Out" due to alcohol prior to entering
               the rooms. He said he had consumed 9 to 10 shots of what he
               believed to be Tequila on 10-30-14. He said he stopped drinking
               at approximately 2030 hours on 10-30-14 and was back in his
               room by 0030 hours on 10-31-14. I confirmed with Valencia he
               felt as if he "Blacked Out" due to alcohol consumption and he
               said something to the effect of "Yeah. I must have. I've
               blacked out a lot of other times, but I usually have someone
               with me to make sure I don't do anything stupid." I asked him
               if he meant to enter the rooms he did not live in and he said
               he did not. I asked to speak with the Hall staff in the
               hallway. We all agreed it would be best to move Valencia out of
               the Hall until Residence Life could review what happened. The
               Rogers Hall "Guest Room" was where Valencia was escorted to.
               His card swipe access to Gannon and Goldsworthy Halls was
               revoked and he was not granted card swipe access to Rogers
               Hall. I told Valencia I would be forwarding charging documents
               to the Whitman County Prosecuting Attorney's Office for
               Residential Burglary as well as Malicious Mischief III. I told
               him he was trespassed from Gannon and Goldsworthy Hall until
               further notice and if caught in either of those buildings would
               be subject to arrest for Criminal Trespass. I escorted Valencia
               to the Rogers Hall "Guest Room". After being in the room for
               approximately 30 seconds, I heard him banging, like he was
               hitting the wall and yelling "Fuck." I walked back to the door
               and knocked. When he answered the door I advised him if he
               breaks anything while staying in the guest room he would be
               responsible for the damages. He said he didn't break anything.
               I told them there were better ways to take his aggression out
               and told him to calm down. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               31st day of October, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               Officer to accompany them when responding to room 220 of
               Community Duncan Dunn. FacOps stated they had received a smoke
               detector tamper alarm in room 220. 3 males were contacted for
               tampering with a smoke detector and smoking marijuana in the

               Lippert 05/11/96 Student Conduct Possession of Marijuana
               NARRATIVE: On 10/31/14 at approximately 0347 hours, I was
               contacted by dispatch regarding a FacOps employee requesting an
               Officer when he contacted a room in Community Duncan Dunn. Upon
               arrival I contacted the FacOps worker who stated he had
               received a smoke detector "head missing" tamper alarm. The
               employee stated that per his policy he need to check the smoke
               detector for liability reasons. I followed the employee to room
               220 where he knocked on the door several times. Nobody answered
               the door and the employee keyed into the room. When the
               employee opened the door I noticed that the door was opening
               slowly because of a rolled up towel that had been placed under
               the door. Once inside the room the employee again announced his
               presence. I turned on the light and saw Ryan J. Gosselin
               11/18/95 and Dillon S. Edwards 12/06/95 laying in their beds.
               Laying on the floor was Douglas A. Lippert 05/11/96. I told all
               three to wake up and they eventually did. I noticed a trash bag
               was duct tapped to the ceiling covering the smoke detector. The
               room smelled of marijuana. It was clear that the three had
               smoked marijuana before going to bed. I asked for all three to
               provide their ID's which they did. I told all three that they
               would be referred to student conduct for smoking marijuana in
               the dorm room and tampering with the smoke detector. Once the
               FacOps employee got the smoke detector back online, we cleared.
               END OF REPORT I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 31st day of October, 2014, in
