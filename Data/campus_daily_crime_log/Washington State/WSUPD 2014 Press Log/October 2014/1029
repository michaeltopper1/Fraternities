               DEPARTMENT CASE #:14-W4405 SYNOPSIS: Report of a scam involving
               an fake job offer. At this time it does not appear any money
               was lost. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Brent J. Lee
               11/03/95 Victim Fraud 2. NARRATIVE: On 10/29/14 at
               approximately 0830 I met with Brent Lee in the lobby of WSUPD.
               Lee came in to report a fraudulent job offer. Lee explained to
               me that on 10/24/14 he received an email offer for a job to
               make $300 a week. Lee responded to the email and asked for more
               information. Lee received an email from a person that
               identified themselves as Rachael Johnson. Johnson explained the
               job required Lee to be a "middle man" in purchasing supplies
               for other "agents" to complete their jobs. Johnson began to
               text Lee explaining further details and asked for online
               banking information, which he provided. Johnson instructed Lee
               to remove the money from the account first, which he did.
               Johnson then deposited $1500 into his account. When Lee
               attempted to purchase items with his debit card he learned his
               account had been suspended. Lee said he went to the bank and
               they informed him the account was suspended and he would need
               to file a police report and contact a branch manager. Lee told
               me since he withdrew his money, it did not appear he lost any
               money at this time. I explained to Lee the complexity of
               investigating these crimes and how to be more cautious in the
               future. I provided Lee with my business card and case number. I
               had Lee forward the email stings to me. I noticed there were
               approximately 20 other recipients of the original email, all
               with an @wsu.edu address ending. I sent a group email to all of
               the other recipients warning them of the scam, and told them to
               contact the WSUPD if they fell prey to said scam. I saved a
               copy of the emails Lee forwarded me to the case. Nothing
               further at this time. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 29th day of October,
               2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               to the Tribal Liaison, reported a gift bag was taken from room
               21B of Cleveland Hall. The gift bag contained a Sweatshirt,
               Coffee Mug, and a jar of Jam. Price valued the bag and items at
               about 30 dollars. Price said there were three gift bags in 21B
               to be handed out to guest speakers. There were a number of
               people in the room throughout the day, but Price believes a
               David Warner was the last one in the room when all three bags
               were there. Price said she walked into the room as Warner was
               leaving and noticed there were only two bags. Price caught up
               with Warner and asked him if he knew anything about the missing
               bag. Warner said he didn't know anything about the bag. Price
               said Warner was carrying his coat folded up and she was unable
               to tell if he had anything wrapped in the coat. Price was not a
               hundred percent sure if Warner had the bag but she seemed sure
               that Warner was the last person in the room when all three bags
               were there. Price said this occurred around noon. More to

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: ENW/328 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W4418 SYNOPSIS: Request for assistance
               with a civil issue in apartment 704 located at 1401 NE Merman
               Dr. Arrangements were made for another place to stay and a
               transportation on 103014. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR#
               1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 102914 around 2022 hrs I was dispatched to
               a civil situation at 1401 NE Merman Dr in apartment 704. Upon
               my arrival I was contacted by Briana C Johnson (101895) and
               told the following. Johnson told me she and her friend, Jaslynn
               C Washington (062496), had a falling out over her sleeping with
               her ex boyfriend, Dominique M Wright (081393). As a result she
               wanted her out of her apartment and didn't care where she went.
               At this point I spoke with Washington and was told following.
               Washington explained she had been invited to Pullman and was
               currently living with Johnson with the intent of going to the
               community college. She went on to explain Johnson was upset
               over her involvement with Wright, but according her her the
               contact was nothing more than trying to act as an intermediary
               to help resolve their issues. Johnson was not happy with this
               and apparently had been told she had been fooling around with
               Wright, which she denied. While I was speaking with Washington
               a third female in the apartment came out and was hovering in
               the area. I asked Cpl Daniels to respond to my area and upon
               her arrival spoke with Johnson again. I asked her if she really
               wanted to do this, given the fact she had nowhere to go and had
               a baby, approximately less than 2 years of age. Johnson told me
               she did care and was "done with her." At this point I returned
               to speak with Washington and when asked if she had any other
               place to go told me she doesn't know anyone here and the bus
               ticket which she had purchased on 102814 was now missing as
               well, which Johnson told me she knew nothing about. I returned
               with Daniels and spoke with Johnson and after a brief
               conversation she allowed us to enter the apartment and search
               for the missing bus ticket. We were unable to locate the ticket
               and attempted to try and arrange housing for the evening. Some
               time later arrangements were made for a room in McCroskey Hall
               and I transported Washington and her belongings there. Upon our
               arrival we spoke with TJ Martin, the RED, and after checking
               her in I cleared. I later returned to the WSU Police Department
               and contacted Dissmores and spoke with the on duty manager
               about Washington's misssing ticket. They told me they could re-
               print one, but she was not listed in the system. I arranged to
               get her a bus ticket back to Seattle and will pass along the
               ticket and information along to dayshift to provide a courtesy

               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 10-29-14 at
               approximately 2231 hours, I responded the President's Mansion
               for the report of a pumpkin being thrown at the front door. I
               contacted the rp, Carmento, who stated she had been near the
               front door when she heard a loud noise. She opened the door and
               saw a pumpkin smashed on the front door, and a male running
               west bound on Campus Ave. She stated she thought he may have
               been wearing a plaid shirt, but wasn't sure. She did not have
               any further description of the male. I took photographs of the
               pumpkin and door. I did not see any damage to the door. It is
               unknown where the pumpkin came from. I moved the main part of
               the pumpkin to the side of the door. I also advised Carmento I
               would have officers drive by the house periodically this
               weekend and for her to call if anything else happened. She
               stated she would. I cleared. I certify and declare under
