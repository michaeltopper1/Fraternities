    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: 316 / Macy WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W4278 SYNOPSIS: Diane Decourcy reported
               she was having problems with the SRC. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: Diane Decourcy reported she was
               being discriminated against by the SRC. At about 1455 hours I
               contacted Decourcy by phone. She answered the phone yelling
               "What, What, What do you want". I quickly identified myself and
               she calmed down. I told her I was calling because she had
               requested to talk with the police about being discriminated
               against by the Student Rec Center. Decourcy then asked me if I
               would be upset if I was filmed taking a shower, and then it was
               put on U-tube. When I told her that I would be upset she
               responded "I wouldn't be, I'm proud of my body". I asked her if
               this had to do with anything at the SRC. Decourcy then starts
               ranting about the military, being in the military, and being
               proud of our military. She continued saying she would never sue
               our military, the SRC, or WSU. I again asked her to tell me
               about her problems with the SRC. She asked me not to judge her
               because I don't know, and don't want to know, what all she has
               to deal with. She continued to tell me how she has to deal with
               the Cartels from Canada to Mexico. She started talking about
               how we all are created equal, and then she said she was sorry
               if she sounded angry, but she was the only one on the planet.
               At this point she paused for a couple of second. I asked if see
               was all right. She then continued telling me she gave 13
               billion dollars to Green Peace, but she was not involved with
               them. I heard Decourcy take a deep breath, and then she said
               she needs a break. I told her taking a break was a good idea. I
               told her to take a break, relax for a while, and then if she
               still wanted to talk about being discriminated against by the
               SRC she could call me back. Decourcy said OK, and then hung up.
               Nothing further at this time. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this ____ day of

               suspects or leads. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 102414 at approximately 0144 hours, I was
               dispatched to a malicious mischief call in Gannon Hall on the
               6th floor stairwell landing. Upon arrival, I contacted Cody E.
               Mannick who told me the following. At approximately 0134 hours,
               she received a phone call from a fellow resident advisor who
               lives in Goldsworthy Hall. The other RA told her that she just
               saw five males on the sixth floor Gannon Hall landing and one
               of them broke one of the windows. They then proceeded to run
               down the stairs to the fifth or fourth floor. I asked if the
               other RA was available to talk with about what she saw and she
               told me she couldn't get a hold of her. I asked if she saw who
               caused the damage and Mannick told me that her colleague didn't
               see who actually broke the window, but that it was likely one
               of five males. I asked if they had any suspect information and
               she told me they didn't. I checked the window and noticed that
               the window was approximately three feet by three feet six
               inches and was a single pane glass window. I took photographs
               of the damage and estimated the cost to repair at $500.00. I
               provided my business card to Mannick and told her to call me if
               they developed any suspect information. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
