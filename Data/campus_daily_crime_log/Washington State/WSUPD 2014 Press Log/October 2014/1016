               Christopher M. Curtis (DOB 12-13-1978) was involved in a non-
               injury vehicle collision. DRIVER 1: Christopher M. Curtis (DOB
               12-13-1978) VEHICLE 1: white, 2005 Chevrolet Van (WA Lic.
               19888E) INSURANCE: Washington State Insurance, government
               vehicle DAMAGE: paint on the driver's side was scratched DAMAGE

               PROPERTY: cement pillar at Martin Stadium INSURANCE: n/a
               DAMAGE: no damage WITNESS(ES): n/a NARRATIVE: On 10-16-2014 at
               about 1211 hrs I was dispatched to a report of a non-injury
               vehicle collision at Martin Stadium, 1775 NE Stadium Way. I
               arrived on scene and contacted Christopher M. Curtis (DOB 12-
               13-1978) and Balram Pande (DOB 06-04-1969). Curtis and Pande
               both work for the concessions division of WSU Dining Services.
               Pande is Curtis' work supervisor and was not present at the
               time of the collision. Curtis was the driver of a white, 2005
               Chevrolet Van (WA Lic. 19888E). This is Curtis' work vehicle
               and is registered to WSU. There were no other passengers or
               witnesses. After speaking with Curtis, I determined the
               following: Curtis had been maneuvering the van around a cement
               pillar in the outer concourse of Martin Stadium near the first
               aid room. Curtis drove around the cement pillar, turned too
               sharp, and the driver side of the van scraped up against the
               pillar. I saw white paint transfer on the side of the cement
               pillar, but the pillar was not damaged. I saw fresh scratch
               marks on the driver's side of the van. I also observed a dent
               and several green in color scratch marks on the driver's side
               of the van. Pande explained that the dent and green marks were
               caused by a previous incident and had not been repaired yet.
               Curtis did not complain of any injuries. The damage to the van
               was consistent with the information provided by Curtis. The van
               had been moved prior to my arrival. I photographed the scene,
               and the photographs have been downloaded into Spillman and
               attached to this case. I cleared the scene. No further action
               at this time. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this __16__ day of

               report. I contacted the complainant, Monique R. McMahon-Hide
               (03/13/95) in the lobby. McMahon-Hide said she lost her cell
               phone on Tuesday, October 14, 2014 between 1300 and 1450 hours.
               She believes she lost it somewhere between Goldsworthy, the CUB

               but it may have fallen out of her bag or she left it somewhere.
               McMahon-Hide describes the cell phone as an Australian phone.

               said the phone should be locked. She tried calling it but
               thinks the battery is dead. McMahon-Hide has checked the
               buildings and walking routes for the cell phone. McMahon-Hide
               reported the phone lost per her insurance company's request. I

               faster than the posted speed limit of 20 MPH. Assistant Chief
               Hansen's radar showed the vehicle traveling at 35 MPH.

               passenger seat of the truck. I immediately could smell the
               strong odor of fresh marijuana coming from the interior of the
               vehicle. I also saw an 18 pack of Corona beer sitting on the
               floor between Gnoinsky's feet. Gnoinsky denied ownership of the
               beer. He told me he didn't have any marijuana on him and
               nothing but what was on his person belonged to him in the
               truck. Wells gave consent to search the vehicle. Before
               searching he admitted to have smoked marijuana earlier in the
               day. He also said there is marijuana in his backpack. Wells
               gave consent to retrieve the backpack and marijuana. I asked
               Gnoinsky to step out of the vehicle and I patted him down for
               weapons. A search of the truck revealed the following items:
               One (1) 12 oz can of Budweiser beer Eighteen (18) 12 oz bottles
               of Corona beer Four (4) bags of green vegetable material that
               smells and looks like marijuana Total weight I certify and

               been stolen. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 10-16-14 at approximately 1841 hours, I responded
               to Nez Perce Apts for the report of a theft. I contacted the
               RP, Kayleen Carl, who stated she believed her roommate had
               stolen a package she had been sent by her family. Carl stated
               the package was supposed to have been delivered on 09-15-14,
               but it never showed. The package had contained a coffee mug,
               coffee grinder, unground coffee, and a package of cookies. She
               stated her family contacted the post office and it showed the
               package had been delivered. Over the next few weeks, Carl
               stated items from the package began appearing at the apartment.
               She said the grinder and cookies appeared at different times
               outside the front door. She said they would appear shortly
               after her roommate would leave, one time in particular was
               after she went to do laundry. She said about a week ago a
               coffee mug, which looked just like the one her family had sent,
               appeared in the kitchen. Carl stated she suspects her roommate
               had opened the package and taken the items. She also believes
               she had taken four pairs of earrings as she saw her wearing a
               pair which appeared to be one of the ones missing. When she
               confronted her roommate about the earrings, she stated they
               were a friends and were just similar, denying they belonged to
               Carl. I asked Carl who her roommate was and she stated Eden
               Kelshaw. She stated they met via a roommate finder website and
               began living together in August. She said she doesn't know
               Kelshaw very well, but does know she had been in ROTC, but just
               recently found out she is no longer part of the program. She
               does not know why she is no longer part of the program. Carl
               advised me she is in the process of moving out of the
               apartment. We spoke about concerns of Kelshaw being confronted
               prior to Carl moving. She stated she would think about it and
               get back to me as Kelshaw was not currently at home. Carl later
               called and advised me she had spoken to her parents and they
               agreed they wanted Carl to wait to have the investigation
               continued until Carl could relocate. Carl stated she would
               contact me when she was relocated and wanted the investigation
               to continue. I told her I would wait to contact Kelshaw until
               she was ready. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 17th day of October, 2014, in

               McClure explained he had been contacted regarding the odor of
               marijuana coming from room 1141. Upon his arrival he noticed
               the odor of what he believed to be marijuana and contacted the
               WSU Police Department. He went on to explain the door to room
               1141 had opened and someone had walked out at which point the
               odor became stronger. I thanked him and went to room 1141 and
               after smelling around the doorway I noticed what I believed to
               be a faint odor of marijuana coming from inside and knocked on
               the door. The door was answered by a male, later identified as
               Taylor B Bishop (010596). As Bishop and I initially spoke I
               noticed his pupils were wide open and his eyes were red, which
               based upon my training and experience are indicators of having
               smoked marijuana. I asked Bishop if he knew why I was there and
               initially he told me he did not know. After a few moments I
               asked him and his roommate, later identified as Austin J
               Sisayaket (030496) to step out into the hallway and speak with
               me. Once in the hallway I asked Sisayaket to have a seat, which
               he did, while I spoke with Bishop. Upon speaking with Bishop I
               asked him again why he thought I was at his room. He nodded his
               head and told me he believed it was for the odor of marijuana.
               I told him that was correct and after a brief discussion he
               told me he had been smoking prior to returning to the building,
               but that he had no marijuana in the room and I could search it
               if I wanted to. At this point we returned to where Sisayaket
               was sitting and I asked to speak with him. Sisayaket's version
               of the events were similar to what Bishop had told me. He also
               went on to tell me he had been smoking marijuana with him, but
               had nothing in the room. I asked him if he would mind if I
               searched his room and he told me that would be fine at which
               point we returned to his room. Once in the room I contacted a
               third male, who had been laying on the bed when I first
               contacted Bishop and Sisayaket. This male was later identified

               as Kevin T Komada (062596) and also admitted to having smoked
               marijuana with Bishop and Sisayaket earlier outside of the
               building. During the search of the room I discovered trace
               amounts of marijuana and several mason jars which contained
               marijuana residue. Bishop also told me he wanted to turn over
               his glass bong for destruction. Upon completion of searching
               the room all subjects were counseled on their behavior and told
               the case would be sent to Student Conduct. All parties told me
               they understood and prior to clearing Bishop, McClure, and I
               went to the dumpster outside of the building where Bishop
               destroyed his bong. Shortly after this I asked Bishop if he had
               any questions, which he did not, and released him. McClure and
               I spoke for a few minutes longer before I cleared. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 16th day of October, 2014, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer
