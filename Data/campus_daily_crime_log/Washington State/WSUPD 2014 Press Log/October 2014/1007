    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: DMJ/338 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W3972 10/07/14 SYNOPSIS: Balloons,
               streamers and condoms found a 10th floor hallway at Rogers
               Hall. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               October 7, 2014 at about 0737 hours I was dispatched to a
               report of malicious mischief on the 10th floor of Rogers Hall.
               I responded to the building and contacted the on duty
               Residential Education Director (RED) Brittany A. Griffin
               (07/26/89). Rogers Hall staff called her about 0730 hours this
               morning. It is unknown when the activity was actually done. The
               male side of the 10th floor was covered in about fifty (50)
               latex balloons. There were some pink streamers decorating the
               length of the hall. Some of the doors had a packaged condoms
               taped to the door. Other doors had an open unused condom
               covering the door knob. There was a sign on the hallway door
               stating that they had been "Pranked." I asked the Rogers hall
               staff if anyone was offended. They said "No". I photographed
               the hallway and doors to the rooms. There was no damage to
               anything and nobody was offended. The sign indicating that this
               was a prank leads me to state that this was not done
               maliciously. It was most likely done by the female side of the
               10th floor. Hall staff was going to pick up the balloons and
               streamers. No further investigation. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               7th day of October, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               an assault which occurred as he was driving through campus. I

               me on 10/06/14 at about 2130 hrs he met a friend, Ryan
               O'Fallon, at the Sports Page to watch a football game. While at

               antagonistic toward Neidiger. He previously told O'Fallon that
               he was not going to hang out with him any more if he kept
               bringing Danny around. They all stayed at the Sports Page for a
               while before deciding they wanted a "change of venue". They
               decided to either go to Moscow or up to WSU Campus. They went
               outside to find a taxi but couldn't find one so Danny called a
               female, who Neidiger said looked like a female police officer
               he knew from a previous occasion. He could not say who it was
               but said she had blonde hair. The female arrived in an older
               van of an unknown color. Neidiger said he would recognize the
               van again if he rode in it again because something with the
               suspension was "wonky" so the ride was funny in the van. They
               drove across the viaduct, toward Moscow. Danny became
               increasingly agitated for an unknown reason as they were
               driving. He began calling Neidiger a "Faggot" repeatedly. As
               they were leaving town the female decided she was not going to
               take them to Moscow. They turned on to Terre View Dr. and then
               down Grimes Way. As they were going down Grimes Way. Danny, who
               was sitting in the front passenger seat of the van, turned
               around and slapped Ryan in the face with an open hand. He then
               slapped Neidiger several times in the face. Neidiger said "you
               aught not do that". Danny responded by slapping Neidiger again.
               Neidiger thought he was slapped a total of 5 times. Danny
               challenged Neidiger to get out of the moving vehicle. Neidiger
               told him no and that he would just like to get out of the car
               and away from him. They drove across campus to the Adams Mall.
               The vehicle reached the parking lot at the Adams Mall, which
               Neidiger described as being at Colorado and Maple. I told him
               the intersection of Colorado and Maple was not at the Adams
               Mall and he said the van parked near the middle of the lot on
               the north side of Adams Mall. They all exited the vehicle and

               Danny attempted to pick a fight with Neidiger. Neidiger refused
               to start the fight and walked away, crossing the parking lot
               and walking down the Ruby St. side of Adams Mall toward
               Colorado St. before continuing home. Neidiger said he was
               concerned because the female did not stop the car during the
               assault. He said he thought the whole thing was planned to make
               him mad and try to get him to assault Danny on camera outside
               the Adams Mall. He said he gave them 12 hours to apologize and
               they did not so he wanted Danny charged with assault. Neidiger
               described Danny as a black male, approximately 5'10" 160 lbs
               who was wearing a white t-shirt and jeans. He described the
               female as being blonde and looking like a Pullman Police
               Officer he knew that didn't like him. He said every time he saw
               the officer he could read her mind and knew she wanted to get
               him. I asked him if he could describe the officer further
               because the only female Pullman Police Officer I knew had very
               dark brown/black hair. He said it was not Officer Lambley, that
               he knew her and it was not her. He said she was blonde and was
               with Officer Breshears one night when they accosted him near
               the train tracks. The female "hovered" in the background and
               looked at him "menacingly". I asked Neidiger if he had
               O'Fallon's phone number so I could call him. He said he did
               not. I asked how he contacted O'Fallon and he said via email.
               Neidiger provided me with O'Fallon's e-mail address. I provided
               Neidiger with the case number and told him to call me if he had
               any additional information or questions. I send O'Fallon an
               email asking him to call me so I could speak with him about
               being a possible victim and witness of the assault. Later
               Neidiger called me again asking about how I was investigating
               the case. He said he felt it was not an assault 3 or 4 because
               it appeared premeditated to try and draw Neidiger into a trap
               of getting into a fight on camera outside Adams Mall. I
               explained how assaults are classified in Washington to him and
               told him that I would be investigating the report as a 4th
               degree assault. Neidiger also told me he spoke with O'Fallon,
               who was scared by my email. Neidiger told him he was not in any
               trouble and was only a witness. I told Neidiger he was correct
               and I only wished to speak with O'Fallon because he was a
               witness and possible victim in the assault. I told him if he
               spoke to O'Fallon again to ask him to call me or come in to the
               WSU Police Department to speak with me. I also asked Neidiger
               what time he thought they were in the north parking lot at
               Adams Mall. He said he was not sure but thought it was about
               2330 hrs. I told him I would try to review the video from
               around that time. I will be contacting Pullman PD to try and
               access the video from around Adams Mall during the time
               Neidiger said he was in the parking lot. More to follow. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 07 day of October, 2014, in Pullman,

               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Arvanetes, Alexandros A Placed in cusody
               Violation of Court Order 2. NARRATIVE: On 100714 around 1650
               hrs I was dispatched to a report of a violation of a protection
               order at the Compton Union Building. I contacted the reporting
               party, later identified as Mam, M Njie (012692), and was told
               the following. Njie explained she has been having problems with
               a male identified as Alexandros A Arvanetes (030478). She
               continued and told me as a result of the problems she had
               applied for, and was granted, a temporary harassment protection
               order. The order expired on 100714, which was when both her and
               Arvanetes had a scheduled court date, which extended the order
               until 100716. She went on to tell me around 1030-1100 hrs on
               100714 she had been sitting in the Muslim Student Association
               office on the 3rd floor of the Compton Union Building. While
               she was in the office Arvanetes came in and attempted to engage
               her in a conversation. Njie told me she shut Arvanetes down at
               every turn and would not engage in the conversation with him
               and he eventually left. At the court appearance on 100714
               before Judge Robinson, Njie told me Arvanetes admitted to
               having violated the order earlier in the day, as well as during
               an email which he had asked a friend to read, or show, to Njie.
               I asked if she had a copy of the email and if she would be
               willing to send it to me. She told me she did and told me she
               had received it from a friend named Sayed Tilal. After allowing
               me to read it she emailed a copy of it to me, which I later
               added to this case. In the email Arvanetes apologizes for his
               actions and asks for Njie to forgive him. He continues and
               eludes to a video which had been sent to her and how it may
               have been misinterpreted. Njie and I spoke for a short time
               longer and I told her I would let her know what I found out
               after I had spoken with Arvanetes. She told me that would be
               fine and I returned to the WSU Police Department. I later
               contacted Whitcom and they confirmed the Anti Harassment order
               prohibiting Arvanetes from contacting Njie. The order also
               showed an expiration date of 100814 . After learning this I
               contacted Tilal. He confirmed he had received an email from
               Arvanetes. He went on to tell me he had spoken with Njie about
               it and she had asked him to email her a copy of it, which he
               did. We spoke briefly at which point he told me he had seen
               Arvanetes a short time prior to contacting me after I had left

               him a message. I explained that I needed to speak with
               Arvanetes and had not been able to reach him. I asked him if he
               would be willing to contact him and ask him to contact me and
               he told me he would. A short time later I received a phone call
               from Arvanetes and he agreed to meet me in front of Sloan Hall.
               Ofc Boyd, who was already at Sloan Hall for another call agreed
               to meet me there and a short time later we contacted Arvanetes.
               During the conversation with him he explained he has previously
               had trouble and just wanted to try and finish out his school
               year so he could spend time with his son. He continued and told
               us if he were to get into legal trouble he would not be allowed
               into Canada, which is where his son is located. We discussed
               this issue for a brief period of time before I asked him about
               contacting Njie. At this point he told us he had contacted Njie
               earlier in the day in an attempt to apologize and ask for
               forgiveness. I also asked him if he was aware of the court
               order barring him from contacting her. He told me he was aware
               of it, but asked for leniency. I explained that my hands were
               tied in regards to a court order and advised him he was under
               arrest and his right to counsel. I placed him in handcuffs and
               transported him to the Pullman Police Department before
               transporting him to the Whitman County Jail without incident.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 7th day of October, 2014, in

               the sign. I responded to Daggy Hall and photographed the sign,
               which was actually a height warning bar for the upper level of
               the parking structure. The bar, which would normally be hanging
               from two eyebolts in the concrete was laying on the ground. I
               spoke to the facilities worker who said it did not appear to be
               damaged and they would simply be able to straighten a bent part
               of the chain and re-hang the bar. I attempted to contact Baylon
               on the phone but only reached his voice mail. I left a message
               requesting he inform me of any damage to the vehicle. I told
               him if there was damage I would come photograph it and if not
               all I needed was the license plate number to associate with the
               case. At this time I have yet to receive any information from
               Baylon. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 07 day of October, 2014, in Pullman,

               thought I was turning and not going straight through the
               intersection. I asked for Pruneda's driver's license, proof of
               insurance, and vehicle registration. Pruneda said he did not
               have his driver's license with him because he had lost his
               wallet about a week ago. I asked Pruneda if he had any forms of
               ID with him and he said no. Pruneda provided his name and date
               of birth verbally. Pruneda also provided the last four of his
               social security number. Pruneda provided his vehicle
               registration and proof of insurance. I returned to my patrol
               car and had dispatch run Pruneda. Dispatch stated that Pruneda
               was suspended through Washington in the 3rd degree. I ran
               Pruneda's driver's license through my MDC and was able to match
               Pruneda to his DOL driver's license photo. I returned to
               Pruneda and asked him to exit his car. Once outside of the car
               I told Pruneda that his license was suspended and he was under
               arrest. I advised Pruneda of his right to counsel and at my
               direction Intern Roberts searched Pruneda incident to arrest.
               No weapons or illegal items were found. Pruneda was placed in
               the backseat of my patrol car while I filled out a Sector
               citation. Once the citation was completed, I explained the
               citation to Purneda, and provided him with his copy. Pruneda
               said he understood the citation and did not have any questions.
               Pruneda was released from custody and reminded not to drive
               until he took care of his driver's license. Pruneda stated the
               understood and I cleared. END OF REPORT I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
