               scene, contacted Laci N. Crua (DOB 08-19-1989) outside the

               a student. Student is overdue to her home in Western
               Washington. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On October 11, 2014 at about 0910 hours I was
               dispatched to a welfare check. I called the complainant,
               Elefteria A. Contoravdis (08/24/94). She told me her sister,
               Connie E. Contoravdis (06/22/96), had left Pullman at 1800
               hours yesterday, Friday, October 10, 2014 and was suppose to
               arrive in Federal Way, WA at about 2200 hours. C. Contoravdis
               has not arrived in Federal Way and there has been no contact
               with her. C. Contoravdis does not have a working cell phone. E.
               Contoravdis has attempted contact with her sister's friends and
               sorority members. So far nobody has responded as it is early in
               the morning for a college student. Officer Olmstead and I went
               to C. Contoravdis's room, Streit 330. We contacted her
               unidentified roommate. The roommate said C. Contoravdis left at
               about 1000 hours on the 10th. She left with her boyfriend,
               Kade. The roommate thought they were traveling to Kirkland,
               where they were spending the night. The roommate did not have
               any contact information for Kade. C. Contoravdis was then going
               to travel home to Federal Way in the morning. The roommate
               provided me a cell phone number for C. Contoravdis as she
               thought her cell phone was replaced or working. I tried calling
               C. Contoravdis but the call would not go through. I called E.
               Contoravdis and told her what I learned from the roommate. C.
               Contoravdis is not in her Streit room and most likely not in
               Pullman. She thanked me for my time. I told her to call me if
               there was anything else I could do for her. No further
               investigation at this time. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 11th day of October,

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W4066 SYNOPSIS: An RA for Waller Hall
               reported that a WSU Mail truck had been parked outside the
               building for several hours and thought it was suspicious. It
               was later determined that the truck had broken down earlier in
               the day and had to be left until motorpool could get to it.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               10/11/14 at approximately 1908 hours, I was dispatched to a
               suspicious call in front of Waller Hall. One of the RA's was
               reporting a WSU Mail Services truck that had been parked
               outside of Waller for several hours. The RA thought it was
               suspicious because of the length of time the truck had been
               there. Upon arrival I found the mail truck to be locked up and
               nobody around. The truck was cold and did not appear to have
               been driven in the last few hours. I searched Waller Hall and
               found nobody who knew anything about the truck. I responded to
               Cooper Publications hoping to find someone in the mail room. I
               found no one inside the mail room but I did find the name Joy
               Rich on a desk. Rich's business card identifying her as the
               mailing service lead. Using Spillman I located a phone number
               for Rich and called her. I explained the situation to Rich who
               stated that she knew about the truck and it had broke down
               earlier in the day. Rich stated she had contacted motorpool but
               they told her they could not do anything till Monday. An email
               was sent to the Officers to notify them of the situation. END

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W4069 SYNOPSIS: Guffin has an active
               trespass order for all of WSU campus. Guffin arrested for
               Criminal Trespass 2nd Degree following a traffic stop on
               campus. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Cory R. Guffin
               09/25/91 Arrested Criminal Trespass 2nd 2. NARRATIVE: On
               10/11/14 at approximately 2126 hours I was driving southbound
               on Stadium Way approaching North Fairway when I noticed a
               silver Honda Accord heading towards me on Stadium Way. The
               Honda appeared to be traveling faster than the posted 20 MPH
               zone. I activated my in car radar (vehicle 4) and obtained a
               reading of 31 MPH. When the Honda passed me I turned around and
               caught up to it as it was turned left onto Cougar Way. When I
               got behind the Honda I noticed the vehicle tabs displayed
               09/2014. I initated a traffic stop at Cougar Way and Northside
               Hall. I contacted the driver, Cory Robert Guffin 09/25/91,
               identified myself, informed Guffin that I was recording, and
               explained the reason for the stop. I asked Guffin for his
               driver's license which he provided. Guffin stated he had just
               started a new job and was going to be paid on the 20th. Guffin
               said he was going to renew his tabs then. Guffin also provided
               his insurance card and vehicle registration. At the time of the
               stop there was one other passenger in the car. I returned to my
               patrol car and ran Guffin through dispatch. Dispatch stated his
               driver's return was clear but he was trespassed from all WSU
               campus. Dispatch stated that Guffin had been served trespass
               paperwork on 04/08/14. About this time Ofc. Petlovany arrived
               on scene. I returned to Guffin and asked him to speak with me
               outside of the car. Once Guffin stepped out I asked Guffin why
               he was on campus when he knew he was trespassed from the whole
               university. Guffin said his girlfriend, Rebecca Marie Dodge
               06/17/95, had a few drinks so he was trying to give her a ride.
               I told Guffin that he was under arrest for criminal trespass
               and handcuffed (D/L) him. Guffin was advised of his right to
               counsel. Guffin was searched incident to arrest and no weapons
               or illegal items were found. I asked Guffin if there was
               anything in the car he would like out. Guffin asked for his
               cell phone and wallet. I told Guffin that we could park his car
               for him but Dodge should not drive since she had been drinking
               underage. Guffin asked for his keys to be given to Dodge so she
               could get another friend to move the car. I retrieved Guffin's
               cell phone and wallet and Ofc. Petlovany parked Guffin's car.
               Once the keys were turned over to Dodge, I transported Guffin
               to the Pullman Holding Facility. Once at the holding facility,

               Sector citation 4Z0947790 for RCW 9A.52.080 Criminal Trespass
               2nd Degree. I explained the citation to Guffin and provided him
               with his copy. I made it clear to Guffin, if he was found on

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W4070 SYNOPSIS: Cougar Security reported
               an intoxicated male. I was unable to locate the intoxicated
               male in question but found 2 others. No action to be taken.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 101114
               at approximately 2310 Cougar Security reported an intoxicated
               male walking with a female. After clarifying the location, Ofc.
               Westerman and I responded to Streit Hall. Before we arrived the
               persons of interest had entered Streit Hall. Cougar Security
               elaborated in saying that it appeared that the male in question
               was acting aggressively towards the female. I clarfied he had
               not assalted the female and they confirmed he had not. Ofc.
               Westerman checked the lobby of Streit-Perham and found nothing
               suspicious. I performed a walk-through of Streit Hall. I found
               nothing related to what Cougar Security reported but did
               encounter to males at room 405. I spoke with Jared R. Garwood
               (013096) and Omar A. Guzman (021696). They appeared to be both
               high and intoxicated based on their eyes, odor of intoxicants,
               and swaying. I instructed them to get anything they were not
               supposed to have in the room. They retrieved multiple Budweiser
               cans and poured them out in the bathroom. I continued my walk
               through without incident. No referrals to Conduct. I cleared. I
               had Cougar Security type up a summary of what they saw. "Cougar
               Units, Orf and Tervo, while on patrol followed a group of three
               individuals east on Cougar Way, one of which appeared
               intoxicated. The group of individuals consisted of two males
               and one female. The male who appeared intoxicated started to
               make unwanted advancements toward the female and she did not
               like it. Cougar Units called in the incident as it appeared
               that it was likely that a physical altercation might occur.
               Before entering the residence hall, the female swung her arms
               at the male as if to hit him, but did not hit the male in
               question. The male is described as white Caucasian, wearing a
               white T-Shirt with light blue sleeves and the number eight on
               the backside and Jeans. The female is describes as white
               Caucasian wearing a white sweater with black leggings. Cougar
               Units followed the group to the Streit-Perham Residence Hall
               where they entered through the side exterior door." Nothing
               follows. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 12th day of October, 2014, in Pullman,

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W4071 SYNOPSIS: Subject reporting that
               someone has been texting her friend claiming to be her.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               10/11/14 at approximately 2313 hours, I was dispatched to a
               suspicious call at Wilmer Davis room 364. Dispatch stated that
               the reporting party said someone had been texting her friend
               disturbing things and claiming to be the RP. Upon arrival I
               contacted the reporting party, Thanh Thao Julia Nguyen
               08/28/96, who was in the RA's room. Nguyen who goes by "Julia"
               said she just found out that someone had been texting her
               friend, Grancesca Gabrielle Orlando 09/08/96, disturbing things
               while claiming to be her. Nguyen said that she had dropped her
               cell phone in the toilet about two weeks ago so she has not
               been able to call her friends. On 10/10/14 her friend Orlando
               told her she believed someone was impersonating Nguyen. Nguyen
               stated she had read some of the text messages that was saying
               things such as she was having sex with her father. Nguyen said
               she did not know why someone would be pretending to be her.
               Orlando arrived a few minutes later. Orlando stated that on
               10/09/14 she had received a text message from the number 520-
               355-5853. The person identified themselves as Nguyen stating
               that Nguyen had just switched phone plans and this was her new
               cell phone number. The person pretending to be Nguyen will be
               referred to as "SUBJECT X" for the remainder of this report.
               SUBJECT X and Orlando had a text conversation for the remainder
               of the day on 10/09/14. Orlando stated she honestly thought she
               was talking to Nguyen to this point. At some point on 10/10/14
               SUBJECT X started to text Orlando saying SUBJECT X was having
               sex with her own father and father's friend. Orlando became
               concerned about the safety of Nguyen and texted SUBJECT X to
               let her come remove her from the situation. Orlando stated that
               the conversation was very disturbing in topic nature. Orlando
               finally figured out that SUBJECT X was not actually Nguyen when
               Nguyen texted Orlando using her Ipad. Nguyen explained that she
               had not texted Orlando in the last few days and she also did
               not have a new phone number. Orlando said SUBJECT X had not
               made any threats or demands, SUBJECT X had just been disturbing
               in the discussion topic. Orlando had already blocked the phone
               number. I provided Orlando and Nguyen with my business card and
               asked Orlando to email me a copy of SUBJECT X's and her
               conversation. Nguyen stated that nobody has tried to contact
               her. Orlando never told SUBJECT X not to contact her prior to
               her blocking SUBJECT X. Once I was back at the station I

               researched the phone number 520-355-5853. Searching Spillman
               and LinxNW I was unable to find any mention of the phone
               number. Using google I found several social media posts
               regarding the phone number. On Twitter I found people in,
               Arizona, California, Massachusetts, and Washington all
               reporting identical text messages from 520-355-5853. It appears
               that SUBJECT X has been texting random number across the United
               States. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
