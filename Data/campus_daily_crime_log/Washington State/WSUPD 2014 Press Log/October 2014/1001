               said the traffic light at Grimes Way turned red and he stopped.

               INSURANCE: N/A DAMAGE: Driver's side mirror glass chipped.
               Estimated at $200.00. WITNESS(ES): None NARRATIVE: On October
               1, 2014 at about 1153 hours I was dispatched to a report of a
               hit and run collision on Stadium Way at Nevada Street involving
               a bus and cement truck. I responded to the area and located the
               City of Pullman Transit bus on Spokane Street just off of
               Stadium Way. The driver of the bus, Simonsen, told me he was
               traveling south on Stadium Way at Nevada Street. The bus was in
               lane #1, nearest the curb. An unknown concrete truck was
               traveling the same direction in lane #2, nearest the center
               line. The concrete truck's passenger side mirror made contact
               with the bus's driver's side mirror. The glass on the bus's
               mirror was chipped on the edge. The driver was able to put the
               mirror back into position and the mirror was still usable.
               Simonsen said due to the angled intersection vehicles in lane
               #2 often will cut over into the lane of travel for those in
               lane #1. Simonsen didn't believe that the driver of the
               concrete truck even knew contact was made between vehicles. A
               Pullman Transit supervisor arrived on scene and documented the
               incident. I was told that they will review the video to try and
               determine which concrete company was involved. They will
               contact me if they want me to make contact with the concrete
               company. Digital photos of the bus were taken. No further
               investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 1st day of October, 2014 in

               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Vinicius K. Carvalho 07/23/91 2. NARRATIVE: On
               10/01/14 at approximately 1200 hours I responded to the WSUPD
               lobby for a lost wallet report. I met with the reporting party,
               Vinicius Carvalho, and asked how I could help. Carvalho
               explained that he was walking on Troy Ln last night (09/30/14)
               around 2200 hours. Carvalho said a little while later he
               realized his wallet was no longer in his jacket pocket. I asked
               Carvalho if he thought it fell out or if someone took it.
               Carvalho said he thought it fell out. I asked Carvalho if he
               had checked the lost and found at the CUB yet and he said he
               did last night. I told Carvalho to check again as well as check
               the lost and found at the CUE (and I showed him where the CUE
               was located). I told Carvalho to cancel his debit/credit cards
               as well. I provided Carvalho with my business card and case
               number, as well as a "to do list". Carvalho asked if he should
               call me back if the wallet is located and I said that would be
               appropriate. Carvalho described his wallet as a black wallet
               containing $100 dollars, 3 debit/credit cards, Brazilian
               documents (he couldn't explain in English what they were), and
               his Brazilian Driver's License. I certify and declare under

               Officer Boyd and I responded to room 823 Stephenson North for
               the reported odor of marijuana. When the door opened there was
               the odor of marijuana. One of the residents of the room,
               Sha'kel L. Hill (07-08-1996) was contacted and denied smoking
               marijuana. Officer Boyd was given permission to enter the room
               and look around and he found no evidence of marijuana having
               been consumed in the room. Hill was thanked for her time and we

               Officer Boyd and I responded to room 823 Stephenson North for
               the reported odor of marijuana coming from that room. According
               to the RP, Brittany A Griffin, she had smelled the odor of
               marijuana and air freshener in the 8th floor of Stephenson
               North and when the door to room 823 opened the smell became
               stronger. As Boyd and I approached room 823, the RP came out of
               her room (821) she nodded her up and down and pointed to room
               823 indicating to me that was the room in question. Officer
               Body smelled the crack of the door and nodded yes indicating to
               me he smelled the odor of marijuana eminating from the crack of
               the door to room 823 Stephenson North. I knocked on the door
               and it was answered by a female later identified by a WA
               drivers license as Sha'kel L Hill. I asked Hill if she knew why
               we were there and she said no. I told her the odor of marijuana
               and she seemed surprised by that statement. She denied having
               smoked marijuana in the room, or smoking it outside and coming
               back to her room. She said her roommate would not condone that
               activity and she said she respected that and wouldn't smoke in
               the room. Officer Boyd asked for permission to enter the room
               and look for evidence of marijuana usage. Permission was
               granted and Boyd said he found no evidence of marijuana in the
               room. He looked in the room while I ran Hill through Whitcom.
               Her return was clear. I told Hill that I would write a report
               of the incident, but it would not be referred to Student
               conduct. I thanked her for her time and cleared. Nothing
               further I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
