               vehicle was last seen turning east onto East Main/SR 270. There

               advise Pullman Police of the vehicle as it was on Main Street,
               but were told to notify WSU. Due to the time delay and that the
               vehicle could be out of the city limits there was no police
               response. No further investigation. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,

               contacted a female about giving her a ride to the Student
               Recreation Center. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On October 12, 2014 at about 1339 hours I was
               dispatched to a suspicious gray vehicle on Cougar Way. I was in
               the area when dispatched. I checked the area and was unable to
               locate the suspicious gray vehicle. I called the complainant,
               Deanna S. Dawson (03/26/93). She told me she was walking to the
               Student Recreation Center today at about 1145 hours. She was on
               the sidewalk next to Beasley between Stadium Way and North
               Fairway Lane when a suspicious car drove past her. The car
               pulled into the north Beasley parking lot and the male driver
               exited. The male approached Dawson. The male identified himself
               as "Chris". He asked her for her name and telephone number.
               Dawson said the male was trying to flirt with her. He asked if
               he could give her a ride several times. She said "no". He was
               standing within arms length of her. At one point he tried to
               put his arm around her waist. Dawson described it as a flirty
               motion. Dawson walked away from him and went to the SRC to work
               out. About a hour and half later she finished her workout and
               was walking back to her C Street apartment. Dawson saw the
               vehicle drive past her on Orchard Drive as she walked by
               Beasley. Dawson continued walking west on Orchard/Cougar Way
               when she saw the vehicle again drive past her near the Soccer
               Field. The vehicle did not stop to contact her on these
               occasions. Dawson wanted to report the incident because she
               doesn't want anyone to get hurt. She said the car driving past
               her was "creepy." The vehicle is described as a newer small gun
               metal gray colored car. It has tinted windows and bigger rims.
               It may be a Ford or Chevrolet. The vehicle is either a two (2)
               door or four (4) door. Dawson was not sure of the doors and
               make/model of the vehicle. The male is described as black, 5
               foot 9 inches tall, athletic/fit build, short dark hair, large
               teeth. He was wearing a red long sleeve shirt or hoodie with
               jeans. He told her he is not a WSU student. I checked the area
               several times for the vehicle and male. I was unable to locate
               him. No further investigation. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 12th day of

               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 10-12-2014 at
               about 1920 hrs I was dispatched to a report of a hit and run
               vehicle collision that had occurred earlier this day in the
               parking lot of the Student Recreation Center (SRC), located at
               1105 NE North Fairway Road. I contacted the complainant,
               Michael T. Wiens (DOB 06-20-1994), at his residence, 2055 NE
               Skyview Drive, B203, in Pullman, Washington. Wiens said on 10-
               12-2014 at about 1815 hrs he parked his black, 1993 Nissan (WA
               Lic. AOF5957) in the SRC parking lot. At about 1900 hrs Wiens
               returned to his vehicle and discovered that it had been
               damaged. Wiens showed me his vehicle, and I saw that the driver
               side rear quarter panel and the driver side corner of the rear
               bumper were dented and scratched. The damage is estimated to be
               $800.00. It initially appeared that white paint transfer was
               left in the damaged area on Wiens' vehicle. Upon closer
               inspection, I determined that the marks were scuff marks and
               not paint transfer. I photographed the damage, and the
               photographs were downloaded into Spillman and attached to this
               case. No suspects or leads were identified. No further
               investigation at this time. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               NARRATIVE: On 10/12/14 at approximately 2100 hours, I was
               dispatched to a drugs call at Rogers Hall room 237. The RED on
               duty, Britteny L. Alspach, had called about the odor of
               marijuana coming from room 237. Upon arrival I could smell the
               odor of burnt marijuana in the hallway and coming from within
               room 237. I knocked on the door and Vincent Edward Summerfield
               05/16/96, opened the door. I asked Summerfield and his roommate
               Young Hyun Nam 06/20/96 to come out into the hallway. Once in
               the hallway I told the two about their options. Summerfield and
               Nam agreed that the wished to turn over their illegal items.
               Summerfield said they were not smoking in the dorm but rather
               in his car. I asked Summerfield if he was willing to grab his
               illegal items from his car and he said he would. Before we went
               to Sumemrfield's car, Nam grabbed a fifth of Bombay Gin and 4
               empty 40oz malt liquor bottles. We walked outside to
               Summerfield's car where he grabbed a backpack out of the trunk.
               Summerfield opened the backpack and I saw a mason jar with
               marijuana, a plastic bong, and several other items of
               paraphernalia. I had Summerfield and Nam walk their illegal
               items over to the dumpster where they were destroyed. The
               following items were destroyed by Summerfield and Nam: -1
               plastic bong -2 metal grinders -1 plastic grinder -3 Rx bottles

               malt liquor -1 half full bottle of Bombay Jin -assorted rolling
               papers and rolling devices Summerfield and Nam said the items
               were both of theirs. Once the items were destroyed I explained
               the laws regarding marijuana. I told both that they would be
               referred to student conduct and explained the process.
               Summerfield and Nam were told they were free to go and went
               back to their room. END OF REPORT I certify and declare under

               was dispatched to a drugs call at Rogers Hall room 823.
               Dispatch stated that the RED could smell the odor of marijuana
               coming from room 823. Upon arrival I could smell the odor of
               burnt marijuana coming from room 823. I knocked on the door and
               Spencer Micahel Mackenzie 04/26/96, answered. When Mackenzie
               opened the door the odor of marijuana intensified. I told
               Mackenzie and the other occupant of the room, Whitney Kathryn
               Kittelson 02/05/96, to sit down in the hallway. Once Mackenzie
               and Kittelson sat down I confirmed with them that neither of
               the were over 21 or had a medical marijuana authorization. I
               told the two that they had two options. The first option was to
               turn over all their marijuana and smoking devices and they
               would be referred to student conduct. The second option was for
               me to apply for a search warrant, if the search warrant was
               granted by the judge, I would search the room, seize any
               illegal items, and arrest based on the illegal items. I asked
               Mackenzie which option he would like. Mackenzie said he wanted
               option 2. I told Mackenzie that his room was being seized and
               he asked if he could get some items out. I told Mackenzie that
               I could clearly see the bong on his desk and I did not want him
               destroying evidence. Mackenzie said he wanted to turn his stuff
               over then. I told Mackenzie that I wanted to make it clear that
               he was not being coerced in his decision. I told Mackenzie that
               he could choose whatever option he wanted. Mackenzie said he
               wanted to turn his items over. Mackenzie grabbed the glass bong
               that I could see through the open door. I asked Mackenzie where
               the stem was for the bong. Mackenzie went back into his room
               and grabbed it. I had to ask Mackenzie several more times to
               grab items that I could clearly see by standing in the hallway.
               It was clear that Mackenzie was not being cooperative in
               turning his illegal items over. After Mackenzie grabbed several
               empty alcohol bottles and his bong, we went outside where he
               destroyed his items. I have no doubt that there is more
               marijuana inside of Mackenzie's room. I explained the laws
               regarding marijuana to Mackenzie and Kittelson. I also
               explained that they would be referred to student conduct and
               explained the process. Mackenzie and Kittelson were told they
