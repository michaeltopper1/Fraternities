               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W3953 SYNOPSIS: Shilo L. Kumpf (DOB 12-
               10-1980) reported that her cellular telephone was stolen.
               Rashad E. Russ (DOB 07-11-1992) was cited and released for
               theft, and the cellular telephone was recovered. NAME/DOB

               Cited and Released Theft 3rd Degree 2. NARRATIVE: On 10-05-2014
               at about 1303 hrs I was dispatched to a report of a theft at
               Martin Stadium, located at 1775 NE Stadium Way. I contacted the
               complainant, Shilo L. Kumpf (DOB 12-10-1980), on the telephone.
               Kumpf reported that on 10-04-2014 she was attending the WSU
               Football game with her husband and young children. Kumpf said
               her eight year old son had his cellular telephone with him.
               Kumpf said sometime between 2230 hrs and 2300 hrs her son lost
               his telephone, and they could not find it. Kumpf was not sure,
               but believed her son might have dropped his telephone as they
               were walking out of the stadium and to their parked vehicle.
               Kumpf said her vehicle was parked in a church parking lot near
               the north side of the WSU campus. Kumpf explained that they
               could not find her son's telephone, so Kumpf and her family
               returned to their home in Pasco, Washington. Kumpf described
               the telephone as: Apple, iPhone 5S, black in color with a green
               protective case, serial #C39ML676FF9R, 509-528-3005. The value
               of the telephone was estimated to be $200.00. Kumpf said she
               sent a text message to her son's telephone, so if anyone found
               it they would see the message on the screen. The message
               stated, "reward if found!! Call 509-619-4248", which was
               Kumpf's telephone number. Kumpf said on 10-05-2014 at about
               1220 hrs she began receiving text messages from an unknown
               individual at the number 909-436-7199. The individual stated
               that he had found the telephone that belonged to Kumpf's son
               and was interested in collecting the reward. The individual
               asked for the reward, and Kumpf offered $50.00. The individual
               replied and said he would return the telephone for $80.00, and
               Kumpf said that would be fine. Then the individual replied and
               said the trade-in value for the telephone was $190.00 and
               suggested that Kumpf should pay him $175.00 to return the
               telephone. Kumpf told the individual that she would be calling
               the police. The individual replied and said he was not
               "stealing" the telephone but was only "asking for the fair
               price for it". Kumpf replied and told the individual that she
               would report the telephone as stolen. The individual stated
               that the telephone was lost due to the "mishap" of Kumpf's son
               and threatened to "drop it where your son left it and be done

               with it". The individual then stated that all he wanted was
               $175.00 to return the telephone and said, "But seeing as you
               aren't going to do that I'll just drop it off where I found it.
               Good day". Kumpf provided me with screen shots of the text
               message conversation, and they have been downloaded into
               Spillman and attached to this case. I checked the telephone
               number, 909-436-7199, in Spillman and saw that it was
               associated with Rashad E. Russ (DOB 07-11-1992). Kumpf told me
               she decided to call the police department for assistance. While
               I was speaking with Kumpf on the telephone, she advised that
               her husband was communicating with the individual via text
               message. I suggested to Kumpf that she tell her husband to
               agree to pay the individual whatever he wanted and set up a
               time and place to meet him. Kumpf advised that her husband made
               arrangements with the individual via text message to pay him
               $100.00 for the return of the telephone, and he agreed to meet
               at 1400 hrs in front of Bohler Gym. I explained to Kumpf that I
               would have a police officer in plain clothes act as her husband
               and meet the individual at Bohler Gym. I told Kumpf to instruct
               her husband to tell the individual to look for a man wearing an
               orange shirt and dark blue pants. The individual agreed to meet
               outside Bohler Gym and said he would be carrying the telephone
               in his hand. I concluded my conversation with Kumpf and met
               with Officer Jones and Officer Kirshner. Officer Kirshner was
               wearing plain clothes and was dressed in an orange shirt and
               dark blue pants. I briefed both officers on the situation and
               at about 1400 hrs we responded to Bohler Gym. Officer Kirshner
               waited on the north side of Bohler Gym, and Officer Jones and I
               monitored the situation from nearby. Officer Kirshner was
               approached by an individual who was later identified as Rashad
               E. Russ (DOB 07-11-1992). Russ was carrying an iPhone in his
               hand that had a green protective case on it, which matched the
               description provided by Kumpf. Russ handed Officer Kirshner the
               telephone, and Officer Kirshner signaled to Officer Jones and I
               that the suspect had contacted him. Officer Jones and I
               converged on the scene and contacted Russ. I told Russ that he
               was detained at this time. Officer Jones activated his body
               camera and began recording the incident. Officer Jones
               handcuffed Russ (double-locked), and I conducted a pat down
               frisk for weapons, without incident. I checked the telephone
               that Russ had given to Officer Kirshner. I saw that it was a
               black in color iPhone, and I saw the reward message on the
               screen of the telephone that Kumpf had described to me. I
               advised Russ of his Constitutional Rights, which I read from my
               Miranda Warning card. I asked Russ if he understood his rights,
               and having these rights in mind, did he wish to speak with me
               now. Russ said yes he understood his rights and said yes he
               would speak with me about the situation. I explained the
               situation to Russ and questioned him about the telephone and
               the text messages he exchanged with Kumpf. Russ admitted that
               he had "negotiated for a fair price" for the telephone which
               was $190.00 but had decided to only ask for $175.00. Russ told
               me that if Kumpf did not agree to his terms, then he would just
               put the telephone back where he found it. Russ stated, "I'm not
               stealing it, I will just put it back". I continued my

               conversation with Russ and he then told me that he was not
               "negotiating" and had simply asked for the fair price. I
               explained to Russ that it was wrong to negotiate the price for
               the return of someone's property. I told Russ that he could not
               withhold someone's property and threaten to dispose of it, if
               they refused to pay for the return of the property. I told Russ
               that the telephone did not belong to him and he had no right to
               demand money from the owner. I asked Russ why he could not have
               simply returned the telephone to the owner. Russ stated that
               the owner "asked for a ransom and I told them the proper price
               for it". Russ then stated that he was not "trying to hold it
               for a ransom". Russ explained that he found the telephone in
               the grass near the LDS church on Orchard Drive. I told Russ
               that he was under arrest for theft and advised him of his right
               to an attorney. I again explained to Russ that his actions were
               wrong and could be considered a criminal offense. Russ granted
               Officer Jones and I consent to view the text messages on his
               cellular telephone. I found the text message conversation
               between Russ and Kumpf's husband on the telephone. I
               photographed the text messages on the telephone. I seized
               Kumpf's telephone as evidence, and it was later logged into
               property. The telephone was an iPhone 5S, black in color. I
               confirmed the serial number for the telephone, and it matched
               the serial number provided by Kumpf. I photographed the
               telephone. The photographs of the text messages and Kumpf's
               telephone were downloaded into Spillman and attached to this
               case. Officer Jones downloaded his body camera video of the
               contact with Russ to the permanent digital evidence file. I
               issued Russ criminal citation #8827 for Theft 3rd Degree. I
               explained the instructions on the citation to Russ, provided
               him with his copy of the citation, and he was released. Even
               though Russ had a local address, he requested that any
               correspondence from the court be sent to his parent's house in
               California. Russ stated that he was a WSU student. I later
               contacted Kumpf and made arrangements to return her telephone
               when she returned to Pullman on 10-25-2014. No further action
               at this time. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this _06___ day of

               trespassing on the Women's Soccer Field. Someone from WSU
               Athletics had already asked the male to leave but he refused. I
               responded to the field where I contacted and warned Marcus J.
               Maxey (04/20/95). Maxey said someone told him to leave. I
               explained the field was not open to the public and used only
               for Women's Soccer. I gave Maxey other field options to play
               soccer on. He was cooperative and polite. Maxey collected his
               belongings and left without incident. There was no damage done
               to the field. When I returned to the WSU Police Department I
               had a voicemail and email message from Shawn Deeds reporting

               called the complainant and updated him on the contact. No
