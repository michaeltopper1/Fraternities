               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. WSU Crop and Soil
               Department Victim Theft II 2. NARRATIVE: On 10/24/14 at
               approximately 0830 hours I spoke with Dori Emerson about a
               stolen laptop. Emerson explained that she is the purchaser for
               the Crop and Soil Department and was notified that a new laptop
               was stolen. Emerson explained that the laptop was received by
               her on 10/06/14. Emerson notified the department member who
               purchased it, David Brown, and said it was at Johnson Hall to
               be picked up. Emerson said the laptop sat on the desk inside
               room 202, which is the receiving room. Emerson said on 10/13/14
               she received an email from Caley Basch (Brown's graduate
               student), stating they came to get the laptop and it was gone.
               Emerson said she has sent numerous emails within the department
               asking if anyone took it on accident, but has received no
               replies. Emerson explained that the laptop most likely went
               missing during day time hours on 10/10/14. Emerson said the
               door to room 202 is unlocked and open during the day, but is
               locked after hours. Emerson said the laptop was still inside
               the original box. Emerson described the laptop as a Lenovo
               Thinkpad L440. Emerson provided me with the order information
               which contained the cost and serial number. I checked on
               Craigslist for any matching laptops for sale, with no luck. I
               completed an NCIC entry form, attached it to the case, and
               provided it to records for entry. As I did not contact Brown or
               Gasch, they were not identified. No suspects or leads. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of

               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 10/24/14 at
               approximately 0945 hours I was dispatched to a suspicious call
               at Fulmer Hall. I called the reporting party, Brittany Starkey,
               and asked her what happened. Starkey explained that she was in
               her Chem 105 class in Fulmer Hall at 0830 hours. Starkey said
               she was sitting behind a middle eastern subject who was looking
               at what appeared to be gun purchasing websites during the
               class. Starkey said she found this unusual because if the
               subject wasn't looking at the sites on his laptop, he would be
               looking at them on his cell phone. Starkey further added that
               it did not appear to just be pictures, but rather lists of
               assault rifles similar to a purchasing site. I told Starkey
               that an officer was on the road looking for a subject matching
               the description she provided. I told Starkey to continue her
               vigilance and if she saw any further suspicious activity in
               class on Monday to contact the department again. At this time
               the subject has not been located and although I can understand
               Starkey's alarm it does not appear to be criminal in nature. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and

               inside a residence hall room. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE

               was dispatched to a report of drug paraphernalia in Goldsworthy
               Hall, located at 1455 SE Stadium Way. I arrived on scene and
               contacted the complainant, Hannah M. Mitchell (DOB 09-09-1985).
               Mitchell is the hall director for McEachern Hall. Mitchell told
               me that drug paraphernalia had been located inside Goldsworthy
               Hall #314. Mitchell explained that one of the residents of the
               room, identified as Maxim D. Kraus (DOB 12-18-1995), had
               invited a resident advisor into his room to use the computer
               printer. While inside the room, the resident advisor had
               spotted a bong on the floor. The bong was on the side of the
               room that was occupied by Kraus' roommate, who was identified
               as Thomas A. Shenk (DOB 03-22-1996). Mitchell introduced me to
               Kraus, who was in standing in the hallway outside his room.
               Kraus gave Mitchell and I consent to enter his room. Once
               inside the room, I saw what appeared to be a glass bong on the
               floor underneath the desk on Shenk's side of the room. I also
               saw what appeared to be a marijuana pipe on the desk located on
               Shenk's side of the room. I questioned Kraus about the bong and
               the pipe, and Kraus told me that they belonged to Shenk. I
               contacted Shenk on the telephone. Shenk said he was out of town
               fishing with some friends. I explained the situation to Shenk,
               and he gave Kraus permission to throw the pipe and bong into
               the dumpster. Shenk said he would take full responsibility for
               the pipe and the bong. I accompanied Kraus to the dumpster
               outside the building, and Kraus discarded the bong and pipe
               into the dumpster. I cleared the scene. No further action at
               this time. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under penalty of

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W4307 SYNOPSIS: Warned Kenneth A. Teems
               (081396) for marijuana. Refer to Student Conduct only. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Kenneth A. Teems (081396)
               Student Conduct Possession of Marijuana 2. NARRATIVE: On 102414
               at approximately 2325 hours I was with RED Hannah Mitchell at
               Rogers Hall on a Drugs call when she received a call from hall
               staff in Goldsworthy Hall that needed attention. Staff had
               located the odor of marijuana coming from the area of room 116.
               We responded and I knocked on the door. Jacob R. Preimsberg
               (071495) answered the door and I could smell the odor of
               marijuana coming from the room. In the room were Luis F. Castro
               Talavera (021495) (roommate) and Kenneth A. Teems (081396).
               They invited me in and offered to let me search their room. All
               stated that they were under 21 and did not possess a medicinal
               marijuana card. Teems asked if he could speak with me
               privately, we exited to the hall. He informed he had smoked
               marijuana elsewhere but that he still had his grinder in the
               room. He thought the grinder still had some green unburned
               marijuana. He retrieved it and disposed of both as he was not
               able to thoroughly clean out his grinder. I told Teems I would
               refer him to Student Conduct but I appreciated his cooperation
               and for stepping up to tell the truth so the other two were not
               blamed. RED Mitchell spent some time speaking with all 3 about
               Student Conduct. We cleared. Nothing follows. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               25th day of October, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.
