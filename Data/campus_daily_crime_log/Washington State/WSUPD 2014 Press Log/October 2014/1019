    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Olmstead/339 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W4215 SYNOPSIS: Chelsea B. Pries (DOB 11-
               20-1991) reported a burglary at the Zoe Coffeehouse. Upon
               further investigation, it was determined that no burglary had
               occurred. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 10-19-2014 at about 0756 hrs I was dispatched to a report of
               a burglary at the Zoe Coffeehouse, located at 720 NE Thatuna
               Street. Dispatch advised that the complainant, Chelsea B. Pries
               (DOB 11-20-1991), had arrived to open the coffeehouse. She
               found a pair of scissors in the door and could not find the
               money for the cash register. Sergeant Jacobson and I arrived on
               scene, and I contacted Pries. Pries explained that after
               calling for the police, she located the money for the register.
               Pries told me that a new employee had closed last night and
               placed the money in a different location. Pries confirmed that
               no money was missing from the business. Pries stated that she
               found a pair of scissors stuck in a hole on the main entrance
               door to the coffeehouse. Pries said the scissors belonged to
               the coffeehouse, and the door was not damaged. There was no
               sign of forced entry, the coffeehouse was locked and secured
               when Pries arrived, and nothing was out of place. It was
               unknown why the scissors were hanging from the door. Sergeant
               Jacobson and I cleared the scene. The original report of a
               burglary is unfounded. No further action at this time.
               Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing

               of drug activity at Orton Hall. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On October 19, 2014 at about 1203
               hours I was dispatched to the lobby of Orton Hall for a report
               of drug activity. I contacted an anonymous resident of Orton
               Hall. I will refer to this person as "John Doe". John Doe
               wanted to report a male who was seen on Friday, October 17,
               2014 with a large jar of what smelled and appeared to be
               individually packaged marijuana. The marijuana was packaged in
               a small green colored balls wrapped with clear plastic wrap.
               The male selling the marijuana is known only as "Niko" (unknown
               spelling, phonetically as "nee-ko"). Niko is often seen on the
               2nd floor of Orton. Niko may have a girlfriend on the 2nd
               floor. John Doe is unsure of where Niko lives. John Doe does
               not think Niko lives in Orton. John Doe is unsure if Niko is a
               WSU student. In the past few weeks there have been more
               sighting of Niko than in the past. Niko is usually "high" when
               John Doe sees him. John Doe wanted the police to be aware that
               someone is selling marijuana on campus. The information will be
               forwarded to the Quad Cities Drug Task Force. No further
               investigation at this time. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 19th day of October,

               Rogers Hall room 238. Ofc. Stewart and I responded. Upon
               arrival the RED on duty, Ross A. McClure, informed me that
               there was the odor of marijuana coming from room 238. Ofc.
               Stewart and I walked to room 238 and Ofc. Stewart was able to
               smell the odor of marijuana coming from within the room. I
               knocked on the door several times but nobody answered. I was
               unable to hear any movement in the room. One of the RA's said
               they thought the person who lives in 238 had left a few minutes
               before my arrival. With the assistance of the RA's, I found out
               that room 238 is a single occupant room assigned to Sierra
               Kirsten Bray 04/02/96. Bray is under the age of 21 which makes
               it illegal for her to possess marijuana as well as it violates
               WSU's policies. Bray will be referred to student conduct for
               this incident. END OF REPORT I certify and declare under

               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 20 October 2014 at
               about 0200 hours, Pullman Police Officer Wade Winegardne radio
               to advise a John Petsch was a suspect in the residential
               burglary and may be headed to Northside Residence Hall.
               Winegardne advised Petsch was wearing a grey sweatshirt and
               shorts. A short time following this Winegardne radioed a person
               they had detained was heading our direction but was no longer a
               suspect. He gave a description of the person as a blue shirt
               with shorts on. A short time later I saw this person on cougar
               way walking towards Northside Residence Hall. I pulled into the
               parking lot to speak with Officer Westerman who was on foot in
               the area. When I came back out onto Cougar Way the person was
               no wear to be seen. As I was driving down Lake Street
               approaching Harvey Street I saw the male with another male. The
               second male closely matched the description of Petsch. I
               stopped on Harvey Street and asked the male his name. He
               identified himself as John Petsch. I told Petsch to place his
               hands on my patrol car. I told him he was being detained at
               this time and placed him in handcuffs. I patted Petsch down for
               weapons and placed him in the back of my patrol car. I told him
               we were waiting for a Pullman Officer to arrive to interview
               him. Officer Emerson from Pullman Police arrived a short time
               later. Emerson advised Petsch of his Miranda warnings. Petsch
               answered several of Emerson's questions. Following the
               questioning Emerson placed Petsch under arrest for Residential
               Burglary and he was transferred to Emerson patrol car to be
               transported down to Pullman Police department. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
