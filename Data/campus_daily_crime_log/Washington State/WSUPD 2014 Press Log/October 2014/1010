               NARRATIVE: On 10-10-2014 at about 1148 hrs I was dispatched to
               a report of broken glass on the ground in a parking lot near
               the Yakama Apartments, located at 675 SE Forest Way. The
               complainant, Kimberly A. Conger (DOB 11-24-1993), reported that
               she had found some glass on the ground in the parking lot and
               was concerned that a vehicle might have been damaged. I arrived
               on scene and located the broken glass, which looked similar to
               broken glass from a vehicle window. The glass was in the
               portion of the blue lot which is located south of the forested
               area (magic forest). The parking space was empty, and it
               appeared that if a vehicle had been damaged, it had been driven
               away. The other nearby vehicles were not damaged. I cleared the
               scene. No further action at this time. Olmstead/339 I certify

               (DOB 11-16-1981) requested a welfare check on Ashley S.
               Ripplinger (DOB 02-17-1984). NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 10-10-2014 at about 1406 hrs I
               was dispatched to a report of a suicidal individual at WSU
               Counseling Services in the Lighty Student Services Building,
               1815 NE Wilson Road. Dispatch advised that a suicidal
               individual, identified as Ashley S. Ripplinger (DOB 02-17-
               1984), had just ran out of her counseling session. Ripplinger
               was described as: white female; tall and thin; short, reddish
               hair; black and white wool hat; gray hoodie; white shirt;
               jeans. Ripplinger was reported to be possibly driving her
               white, 2014 Dodge Dart (WA Lic. X957WSU). Officer Jones and I
               responded and searched the area for Ripplinger. Officers from
               the Pullman Police Department responded to Ripplinger's
               residence, 1615 SE Bleasner Drive #3, but she was not located.
               After determining that Ripplinger was no longer in the area, I
               contacted the complainant, Audrey L. Schwartz (DOB 11-16-1981),
               in her office at the Lighty Student Services Building. Schwartz
               is a licensed psychologist for WSU Counseling Services.
               Schwartz stated that earlier today at about 1300 hrs she was
               meeting with Ripplinger in her office. Schwartz stated that
               during the counseling session, Ripplinger admitted to using
               "meth" and made statements such as "this is it" and "it's all
               over". Ripplinger admitted that she needed to go to the
               hospital for detox, but once Schwartz started to call for the
               transport, Ripplinger ran out of the office. Schwartz said that
               Ripplinger indicated during the session that she had parked her
               vehicle in the metered spaces along the north side of the
               French Administration Building. Schwartz said that Ripplinger
               has made statements about having a 9mm handgun in her vehicle
               and possessing other firearms during past counseling sessions.
               Schwartz told me it was her professional opinion that
               Ripplinger was suicidal and should be taken into protective
               custody. Schwartz stated that she did not believe Ripplinger
               was a danger to anyone else. I concluded my contact with
               Schwartz and cleared the scene. I requested that Dispatch
               broadcast an ATL for Ripplinger to all local law enforcement
               agencies. I later reviewed the facts in this case. I called
               Ripplinger's cellular telephone number, 509-205-8181, but it
               was not answered. At about 1730 hrs I requested that Dispatch
               attempt to determine the location of Ripplinger's cellular
               telephone. Dispatch advised that they were able to locate

               Kurtis (DOB 03-20-1989) requested assistance in dealing with a
               student who has been causing problems at the College of
               Communication. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 10-10-2014 at about 1534 hrs I was dispatched to
               a report of a student causing problems at the WSU College of
               Communication, Murrow East, located at 455 NE Library Road. I
               contacted the complainant, Christine M. Kurtis (DOB 03-20-
               1989), on the telephone. Kurtis is a faculty member for the
               College of Communication. Kurtis explained that her department
               has been having problems with an individual, identified as
               Andrew A. Auger (DOB 07-03-1991). Kurtis stated that Auger is a
               student at WSU and is a communication major. Auger has not
               fulfilled the requirements which are necessary to continue in
               the program and was de-certified. Kurtis said that Auger met
               with the Dean of the College of Communication and was told that
               he could not continue with the program. Auger has returned to
               the department offices and has become argumentative with staff
               members. Kurtis stated that on 10-08-2014 Auger returned to the
               Dean's office and demanded to meet with the Dean again. Kurtis
               explained that faculty and staff members have become
               increasingly concerned with Auger's behavior and are worried
               about their safety at work. Kurtis inquired about trespassing
               Auger from the following locations: 1) Student Services Office,
               Murrow East #226, 2) Dean's Office, Goertzen Hall #101, and 3)
               College of Communication Business Office, Jackson Hall. I
               explained to Kurtis that at this time, Auger had not committed
               a criminal offense. I told Kurtis to instruct faculty and staff
               members to immediately call 911 if Auger arrives in their
               offices and becomes augmentative and disruptive. I suggested
               that Kurtis contact Adam Jussel, who is the director of WSU
               Student Conduct, and request assistance from his office
               regarding the trespass issue. After speaking with Kurtis, I
               contacted Jussel on the telephone and explained the situation
               to him. I told him that Kurtis would be contacting his office
               to inquire about trespassing Auger from the Department of
               Communication offices. No further action at this time.

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: BRW/325 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W4055 SYNOPSIS: Odor of marijuana coming
               from room 308 in Goldsworthy Hall. Two subjects warned for
               possession of marijuana. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE 1. Bijan A.
               Safai 05/06/96 Warned/Student Conduct Poss. of Marijuana 2.
               Alec J.X. Scully 05/19/95 Warned/Student Conduct Poss. of
               Marijuana NARRATIVE: On 10/11/14 at approximately 0059 hours, I
               responded to Goldsworty Hall room 312 where the RED on duty,
               Britteny L. Alspach, was reporting the odor of marijuana. Upon
               arrival Alspach stated that RA's had reported people smoking in
               room 312. I smelled the door of room 312 but could not smell
               marijuana. The hallway smelled strongly of burnt marijuana
               however. I started smelling the sourrounding doors until I came
               to room 308. When I reached room 308 I could smell burnt
               marijuana and masking agents coming from within the room. I
               could also hear two male voices talking inside. Several
               different times I heard someone coughing in the room. I knocked
               on the door and Alec John Xavier Scully 05/19/95 opened the
               door. As soon as Scully opened the door the odor of burnt
               marijuana intensified. I asked who was in the room and Scully
               said just him and Bijan Andre Safai 05/06/96 who was laying on
               the floor. I asked the two males to step into the hallway which
               they did. I asked the two if they had medical marijuana cards
               and they said no. I told the two that as long as they were
               willing to turn over all their marijuana and smoking devices I
               would only be sending them to Student Conduct and not the
               prosecutor. Both stated that they believed that was a good
               option and went back into the room and retrieved, a grinder,
               glass bong, and two small sandwich bags of marijuana. We walked
               out to the dumpster where Scully destroyed his illegal items. I
               explained the law regarding marijuana as well as the WSU
               policies. I told the two that they would be referred to student
               conduct and explained the proecess. Both stated they
               understood. I told Scully and Bijan that they were free to go
               and they left. END OF REPORT I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 11th day of

               they helped her get home. Shepherd was only responsive to pain.
               I had the two girls helping her put her in the recovery
               position which caused Shepherd to vomit copious amounts of
               clear liquid. Medics arrived and transported her to PRH. We
               cleared. Nothing follows. I certify and declare under penalty

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W4058 SYNOPSIS: Backed up Deputy Jordan
               on a Domestic call. No arrests made. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 101114 at approximately 0356
               hours I spoke with Deputy Jordan via telephone. He was
               requesting back up as he was going to the possible location of
               a domestic dispute. I told him both Ofc. Westerman and I could
               assist. Deputy Jordan informed me of the basics of the case in
               regards to a 911 call that was made. We met him at the
               Dissmores parking lot and then proceeded to 120 NW Webb St.
               Deputy Jordan knocked on the door for quite some time.
               Eventually Aaron M. Cameron (092968) answered the door. He
               agreed to get his girlfriend Valena M. Barnes (101863). They
               both came outside to speak with us. I first spoke with Barnes
               who may have been groggy from sleeping but had also consumed
               alcohol. She attempted to hide her face from me. She had red
               marks on the left side of her face and a what appeared to be a
               fresh bruise under her chin. She stated they were due to the
               way she slept. She stated she misdialed 911 as her son had a
               new phone number. She was evasive and claimed she had not been
               the victim of a crime. Barnes would not give me much
               information. I then informed Deputy Jordan of the marks I saw
               and he went to speak with Barnes. I spoke with Cameron
               regarding the marks and he denied assaulting Barnes but did not
               challenge their existence. He admitted to having drank. He was
               cordial. Ofc. Westerman made small talk with Cameron for the
               remainder of the event while Deputy Jordan continued to talk to
               Barnes. We provided Deputy Jordan with DV packets for each
               individual. Cameron granted permission for us to enter the home
               to verify nothing had been damaged in an altercation. One chair
               did have a broken leg. Probable cause for an arrest was not
               developed. We cleared. Nothing follows. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
