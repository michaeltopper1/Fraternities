               mischief report. Upon contact Muhunthan told me the following.
               On 102414 at approximately 1700 hours, he left Sloan Hall
               through the courtyard and the WSU Engineering concrete canoe

               his coworker Von Walden emailed him stating the canoe had been
               damaged. Muhunthan told me he has no idea who may have caused
               damage to the canoe, and he valued it at approximately
               $1000.00. I checked the canoe and it appeared that someone
               jumped or walked on the center of it while it was on display in
               the Sloan Hall Courtyard. The center of the canoe was broken
               into several pieces. I took photographs of the damage and asked
               Muhunthan to contact me if anyone in the department had any
               information as to who may have caused the damage. Case inactive
