               which occurred sometime over the weekend. It is unknown if
               anything was actually stolen. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 10/06/14 at about 1003 hrs
               Dispatch advised of a reported burglary which occurred sometime
               over the previous weekend at the Washington Building. I
               responded and contacted the complainant, Donna M. Hash
               (061564), who directed me to the basement level of the
               Washington Building. She told me a custodian found the doors to
               two storage rooms kicked in. I spoke to the custodian, Howard
               F. Long (090553), who told me at about 1000 hrs he was going to
               room G-29 to place some items in storage. The door was closed
               but when he went to put his key in noticed the door was damaged
               and pushed open. It appeared someone forced the door open. He
               reported the damage to Hash, who responded. As she was looking
               around she noticed the door to room G-27 was also closed but
               was damaged and appeared to have been forced open sometime over
               the weekend. Hash said she was unsure if any items were taken.
               Both rooms are storage rooms. G-27 is IT storage and has
               several computers and computer equipment inside. She said
               nothing appeared to be missing but when their IT person
               returned to work from being sick she would have him do an
               inventory. Hash said they did not find any exterior doors
               forced open or damaged. There is a stairwell right next to room
               G-29 which exits on the south side of the building behind some
               bushes/trees. I went down the stairwell and found the exterior
               door propped open and unlocked. I believe this door is normally
               unsecured as it is an old wood door with several windows. The
               only interior door to the building from the stairwell is the
               one which is next to room G-29. That door was closed and
               secured to prevent entry to the building from the stairwell
               without a key. I am waiting for information from Hash's IT
               person regarding the inventory status of room G-27. No suspects
               or leads at this time. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 06 day of October,

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W3963 SYNOPSIS: Issac J. Daniels (02-07-
               95) called Whitcom stating someone stole his wallet out of his
               back pocket while he was attending the WSU Football Game on 10-
               04-14. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               10-06-14, at approximately 1036 hours, I was assigned a cold
               theft case. I contacted the reporting party, Issac J. Daniels
               (02-07-95), and asked what I could do for him. Daniels told me
               he believes someone bumped into him while he was attending the
               WSU football game on 10-04-14, and stole his wallet out of the
               left rear pocket of the cargo shorts he was wearing. He told me
               just before half time he walked to the concession stand area
               and upon arriving, realized he did not have his wallet. He
               walked back to the area which he had been sitting (section 24,
               near the bottom row, closest to the field) and looked around.
               He did not find his wallet. He said he remembers someone
               bumping up behind him as he went to the concession stand area,
               but didn't think about it until he was up at the concession
               stand. He waited until this morning (10-06-14) to call to
               report the incident because he wanted to see if any of his
               friends found it. They did not. He described his wallet as
               being a "Knock off" of a Louis Vuitton wallet. It was brown in
               color and contained a debit card, issued by Chase Bank, a WSU
               issued Cougar Card, and an insurance card. He said the wallet
               only cost about $20.00 and he cancelled the debit card and had
               no unauthorized transactions made to his account. I gave him a
               WSU Police Case number and asked him to contact me if he found
               any of his items. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 6th day of

               subject requesting phone contact regarding a lost Ipod touch. I
               contacted the complainant, Travis D. Studer, who told me on the
               evening of 09/12/14 he was in Martin Stadium just looking to
               see what the stadium looked like at night. He was on the field
               and thinks at some point he lost his Ipod touch. The Ipod was
               black on the front and silver on the back. I asked if he
               contacted WSU Athletics and he said he had not. I provided him
               with their contact information because they have a separate
               lost and found from the Police Department. I asked him to
               contact me after he called athletics to let me know if he found
               his Ipod or not. I also asked him to try and locate the serial
               number if he did not find his Ipod so he could give me that as
               well. More to follow. I certify and declare under penalty of

               was arrested for Assault 4 DV. He was booked into the Whitman
               County Jail NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.Oliver,
               Dylan L. 011090 Booked Assault 4 DV 2. NARRATIVE: On 10-06-14 I
               was dispatched to a possible domestic assault in progress at
               the Valley Road Playfields. I responded to the area and
               contacted the victim a Shanee Wimberly she told me that she had
               been arguing with her boyfriend a Dylan L. Oliver. The two went
               to The Valhalla Sports Bar for the Seattle/ Washington Football
               game. He been drinking excessively and she wanted to leave.
               Oliver was being disruptive to other patrons and was worried he
               would get in a fight. As they were walking home she tried to
               talk to him about his drinking and the two began to argue. They
               began arguing loudly and Oliver punched her in the left arm.
               Shortly after Oliver hit her a passerby intervened and
               separated the two. He told her to call 911. Oliver ran north
               from the area. I asked her if it hurt and she said it did. I
               had he pull up her sleeve so she could show me the area.
               Winterly is a light skinned African American female. It was
               dark out side. With the help of my flash light I could see a
               slight reddening of the skin. Due to the light level I could
               not get a picture of the mark. I asked Winterly if he touched
               or struck her anywhere else and she said he didn't. She said
               she was taken back by the fact that he hit her. I asked her if
               it had happen in the past and she said "Several times. When he
               gets drinking he becomes aggressive and violent." I asked her
               how long they had been boyfriend and girlfriend. She said
               "About a year." I asked her if she thought it was a significant
               dating relationship and she said "Yes." I asked her where
               Oliver lived and she said CC M-318. I had Officer Welter
               respond to Oliver's apartment. I gave Wimberly a ride to her
               apartment and told her I would be back. Before I left she asked
               if I could get her cell phone from Oliver's apartment. I told
               her I would try. I met up with Welter at the apartment. Welter
               stated that when he arrived the apartment door was wide open.
               No one would come to the door. Sgt. Dornes arrived on scene and
               closed the door. While Welter and I were discussing what to do
               next a male matching Oliver came out of an apartment. Welter
               approached the male and asked him if he was Oliver and said he
               was. Officer Welter told him he was being detained and placed
               him in hand cuffs. I walked up to him and asked him he name and
               he said Dylan Oliver. I reread him his constitutional right off
               my department issued card. I asked him if he under stood his

               rights and he said "Maybe well sort of." I told him that wasn't
               good enough. I needed a yes or no. I again explained his rights
               and he again said "Well maybe ort of." I told him that he had
               the right not to talk to me. He said he didn't want to talk to
               me. I told him he was under arrest for Assault 4 DV and he had
               the right to an attorney. He asked me to explain why he was
               under arrest. I told him I had receive an report that he had
               assaulted his girlfriend. I told him that Wimberly had reported
               he struck her with a closed fist. At Wimberly'as request I
               asked Oliver if he had Wimberly's cell phone in his apartment.,
               He said it was on the table. I asked him if he would be willing
               to let me retrieve it for her. He said that would be fine.
               Oliver, Officer Welter, and I walked to the 3rd floor
               apartment. The door had been opened by Oliver's roommate. At
               the door I explain to Oliver he didn't have to let me enter the
               apartment and retrieve the phone if he didn't want he to. He
               said that I had permission to enter and get the phone. I found
               the phone on the dining room table. I picked it up and placed
               it in my pocket. Officer Welter placed Oliver in the rear of
               his patrol car then transported him the Pullman PD's holding
               facility. I responded back to Wimberly's apartment. I told her
               we had found Oliver and he was under arrest for the assault. I
               gave her the phone and she thanked me. I asked her if she would
               be willing to write a written statement about the incident. She
               said she would and provided one. I gave he the victims right
               card and explain to her what the court process would be like. I
               told her if he tried to contact her to call the police and let
               us handle it. She thanked me for all our help and I left her
               apartment. A PC Booking sheet was written. Oliver was
               transported to the Whitman County Jail where he was booked for
               Assault 4DV. A copy of the case has been sent to the Title 9

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: BRW/325 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W3971 SYNOPSIS: Ofc. Engle who was off
               duty witness a reckless driver that started in the area of Main
               St and State St who continued to drive recklessly until the
               driver came to a stop on Wilson Road in front of the Fine Arts
               Building. The case was turned over to Pullman PD Officers after
               their arrival. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 10/07/14 at approximately 2149 hours, I heard
               dispatch stated that an off duty officer had a vehicle stopped
               on Wilson Road near the Fine Arts Building related to a traffic
               offense. Dispatch was requesting WSUPD Officers to back up the
               Officer. Sgt. Jacobson and Sgt. Griffin stated they were en
               route on foot from the station. I was just clearing a traffic
               stop at North Fairway and Beasely Coliseum and also headed that
               way. Upon arrival I found Ofc. Engle standing near the driver's
               side door of a Isuzu Trooper. I noticed Ofc. Engle had his off
               duty gun holstered as he stood near the car. As I walked up to
               Ofc. Engle I noticed a set of key on the pavement a few feet
               away from the driver's side door. I assumed the keys belonged
               to the Trooper. As I reached Ofc. Engle, he asked the driver,
               later identified as Nichelle D. Powers 12/13/90, to exit the
               car. About this time Sgt. Jacobson arrived on scene and I asked
               Powers to speak with Sgt. Jacobson. I spoke with Ofc. Engle
               about what he witnessed. Ofc. Engle stated he saw the Tropper
               turn from State St onto West Main St. When Powers turned she
               crossed the centerline, swerved back into her lane, and
               continued to accelerate quickly. Ofc. Engle followed Powers in
               his personal vehicle as Powers turned left onto Paradise St
               from Grand Ave. When Powers turned left she spun her tires
               causing the rear end of the Trooper to fishtail. Ofc. Engle
               stated that Powers again was accelerating quickly to
               approximately 35 MPH in the posted 25 MPH zone. When Powers was
               going though the section of Paradise that parallels Chevron,
               Powers crossed lanes without signaling. Powers continued
               eastbound on Main Street past the viaduct. Ofc. Engles stated
               that he was going approximately 45 MPH to follow Powers and
               Powers was still pulling away from him. Ofc. Engle estimated
               Powers speed to be over 50 MPH in the 35 MPH zone. Powers came
               to a stop at the intersection of East Main and Stadium Way.
               When the stop light turned green, Powers turned left onto
               Stadium Way. Powers was accelerating quickly and crossed into
               the next lane of travel. From the area of Nevada Street to
               Wilson Road, Powers was going approximately 40 MPH in the 20
               MPH zone of Stadium Way. When Powers reached Wilson Road she

               slowed down and turned left onto Wilson. Powers ignored the two
               "Do Not Enter" signs on either side of Wilson Road. Powers came
               to a stop near the Fine Arts Building. Ofc. Engle approached
               the car and four passengers got out. One male asked if he could
               leave and Ofc. Engle said he could. The other three passengers
               walked a short distance away and sat down. I walked over to the
               three remaining passengers. The passengers were later
               identified as, Simon O. Shaffer 04/20/94, Hailey M. Colwell
               10/28/94, and Rhiannon L. Baisch 09/04/96. I asked the three
               what had happened. Shaffer said one of their friends needed to
               make it to the Fine Arts Building before 2200 hours. Shaffer
               said that he was egging Powers to drive fast. I briefly told
               them what had been reported to me and asked if that sounded
               correct. All three said yes. I asked if at any point did
               someone tell Powers to slow down or that she was scaring them.
               Shaffer said they had been encouraging Powers to drive crazy. I
               next spoke with Powers. I told Powers that I did not need her
               to tell me what happened because everybody had provided the
               same story. I told Powers that I was curious why she made the
               decisions that she did. Powers said she was trying to impress
               Shaffer who had been sitting in her back seat. Powers stated
               that two of her friends had been in an augment and as a way to
               lighten the mood, Powers decided to spin her tires leaving a
               driveway. Powers said her passengers were teasing her that she
               could not get to the Fine Arts Building by 2200 hours. Powers
               said she took the situation a little too far and while trying
               to impress Shaffer. I asked Powers if she had anything to drink
               tonight and she said no. I asked Powers if she was willing to
               take a PBT test. Powers said she would. I found my PBT (Alco-
               Sensor FST #16805) in working condition. Powers provided a PBT
               sample of .000. About this time Sgt. Jacobson informed me that
               Pullman PD was taking over the investigation. I meet up with
               Ofc. Myklebust of the Pullman Police Department and informed
               him of what I had learned. The case was turned over to Pullman
               Police Department and I cleared. END OF REPORT I certify and
