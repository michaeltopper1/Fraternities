               reported the WSU Green Bike he had locked up near the entrance
               to Stephenson East on 10-20-14, was missing as of 10-21-14.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: I
               contacted Jimmy Lam (07-01-96) who said he had checked out a
               WSU Green Bike from the bike station on Stadium Way near Troy
               Lane on 10-20-14, between the hours of 1500 and 1600. He rode
               the bike to his residence hall (Stephenson East) and said he
               locked it up to the railing near the entrance to Stephenson
               East. He said he used the bike's integrated cable lock and was
               100% sure the bike was locked prior to him entering Stephenson
               East. He said the reason he is sure it was locked is he still
               has the keys to the bike lock. He said he would not have been
               able to retrieve the keys unless the lock was actually fully
               locked. Lam exited Stephenson East on 10-21-14, between 1210
               and 1230 hours, and realized the bike was no longer where he
               had locked it up. He has no suspects or leads. Lam came to the
               WSU Police Department on 10-21-14, at approximately 1430 hours
               and said he had received a phone call from the WSU Student
               Recreation Center stating they had "Picked Up" all of the WSU
               Green Bikes which were in the area of the Stephenson Complex on
               the morning of 10-21-14. The theft; therefore, is unfounded.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 21st day of October, 2014, in

               at approximately 2147 hours, I was dispatched to a burglary
               report in Rogers Hall room 331. Upon arrival, I contacted
               Tizita S. Biru who told me the following. On 102114 at
               approximately 0700 hours, she left her HP laptop sitting on her
               bed while she left for class. When she returned at
               approximately 1630 hours, her laptop was missing. I asked Biru
               if she knew the model and serial number for her laptop and she
               told me she didn't know any of that. I asked her what the value
               of her laptop was and she told me it was approximately $700.00.
               I asked her if she knew who may have taken the laptop and she
               told me she didn't. I asked if she left her room unlocked and
               she told me that it was always unlocked. I asked her if she had
               any other wireless devices that she uses on the WSU Network and
               she told me she had her Samsung Galaxy SIII and an Ipad that
               she uses. I recorded her MAC addresses for both to eliminate
               them when attempting to flag the MAC address for her computer.
               I asked her if she used her laptop on the WSU WIFI and she told
               me she did. She told me her WSU NID is tizita.biru. I provided
               Biru my contact information and asked her to contact me if she
               locates her laptop or she obtains any potential suspect
               information. She told me she would. I emailed the WSU IT
               Security to have her laptop's MAC address flagged as stolen.
               Case inactive pending further leads. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of

               arrival and we were unable to locate him. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Wright, Dominique M (081393) 1. Assault
               4th (DV) 2. Residential Burglary 2. NARRATIVE: On 102114 around
               2203 hrs Ofc Westerman and I were dispatched to a report of a
               domestic violence assault which had just occurred at 1401 NE
               Merman Dr in apartment 704. While we were en route we were told
               the male, identified as Dominique M Wright (081393), had left
               the scene and was reported to be wearing a baseball cap. I
               responded directly to the apartment, while Westerman began to
               search for Wright. Upon my arrival I spoke to the reporting
               party, identified as Brianna C Johnson (101895), who told me
               the following. Johnson explained her "baby daddy" whom she
               identified as Dominique M Wright (081393) had shown up at her
               apartment. She went on to tell me she had two females inside of
               the apartment at this time and she and Wright were outside of
               the apartment. She continued and told me they were verbally
               arguing at which point she walked back into her apartment. She
               also pointed out that Wright is not on the lease and does not
               live there. Once inside the apartment Wright entered the
               apartment without being invited and was told to leave, which he
               did not. Johnson went on to tell me the two females left the
               apartment at this point and she went back into the bedroom on
               the east end of the apartment where hers and Wright's baby was
               located. According to Johnson the argument continued at which
               point Wright shoved her. As a result she fell over the corner
               of the mattress and fell onto the floor. Upon hitting the floor
               Johnson bumped into a bowl which contained milk, causing it to
               spill onto the floor and the back of her left leg. Johnson
               stood up at which point Wright struck her in the right side of
               her jaw with his fist. Johnson ran out of the room and grabbed
               a bottle of pepper spray and told Wright to get out. Wright ran
               out of the apartment and Johnson followed him, losing the
               pepper spray as she was following him. At this point I looked
               at the side of Johnson's face and saw no indication of having
               been struck. When asked about the altercation in the bedroom
               she pointed out the room to the east and I walked in a could
               see where a bowl of milk was sitting on the floor near the head
               of the bed. It appeared to have been disturbed and some of the
               contents had spilled out onto the floor as she had described.
               After returning to where Johnson was sitting I asked her if it
               would be all right to take some photos of the the room as well

               as her face and area which had soaked up the milk which had
               been spilt. She told me that would be fine and upon returning
               with my camera I photographed the above described areas and
               later downloaded them to this case. When I asked where Wright
               would go she told me she did not know. I asked her if she knew
               where he currently lived and she told me she didn't know the
               address but described it as a blue house near Stubblefields
               Bar. I also gave Johnson a Domestic Violence packet and
               explained it to her. She told me she had 3 or 4 of them
               already. I told her I was required to give her one and went on
               to explain it to her. I asked her if she was going to feel safe
               in the apartment and she told me she was going to leave as soon
               as we were done speaking. I asked her if it would be all right
               to contact her if I had any further questions and she told me
               that would be fine. Prior to leaving I asked her if the two
               females I had seen as I arrived were the two in the apartment
               when the incident took place. She told me she didn't know and
               didn't want to speak with them because they did nothing while
               the incident unfolded. I told her I was going to try and speak
               with them and told her to contact me if she had any questions
               or problems. She told me she understood and had no further
               questions before I left. After leaving the apartment and
               approaching my patrol car I noticed the two females I had seen
               when I arrived. I approached them and asked if they had been
               the two female Johnson had told me about. Both females told me
               the were not going to get involved and Johnson would not like
               what they had to say. I explained if there was another side of
               the story I was not being told I needed to hear it. Both
               females refused to provide any further information and would
               not identify themselves. Westerman, who had arrived around this
               point, and I cleared a short time later. Some time later
               Officer Mykelbust of the Pullman Police Department confirmed
               Wright was staying at 1025 NE Indiana. They also told me he was
               not there and didn't know where he was located. Around 0000 hrs
               while reviewing the information from this case I noticed a
               temporary no contact order on Wright issued in Whitman County.
               I contacted the Whitman County Jail and a short time later they
               told me the order was not currently in effect. I thanked them
               and cleared. I attempted to contact Wright at the phone number
               given to me by Johnson when I spoke with her earlier and did
               not receive an answer. No voicemail was set up and I will
               attempt to locate Wright on 102214 and obtain his side of the
               story before proceeding further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 22nd day of

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: BRW/325 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W4251 SYNOPSIS: Allen taken into
               protective custody and transported to the hospital after
               bizarre behavior. Allen may have been experiencing a mental
               breakdown. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Casey R.
               Allen 09/23/90 Protective Custody Disorderly 2. NARRATIVE: On
               10/22/14 at approximately 0340 hours I was dispatched to a
               disorderly person at Orton Hall room 1028. Sgt. Jacobsen and I
               had just left a welfare check call at that room approximately
               15 minutes prior to this call (see case 14-W4249). Upon arrival
               I meet with Hannah Mitchell who was the RED on duty. Mitchell
               stated that after we left, Casey Robert Allen 09/23/90, went
               back to his room and again began to yell at the top of his
               lungs and throw things around his room. Sgt. Jacobsen and I
               walked to room 1028. I could hear Allen yelling at the top of
               his lungs from about 20 feet way. When I reached Allen's room,
               I listened for about a minute while Allen yelled "fuck" over
               and over. Allen's scream seemed painful in nature. Fearing that
               Allen was hurting himself inside the room I asked the RED to
               grab the master key for the building. While Mitchell was
               grabbing the key I knocked on the door and identified myself. I
               could hear Allen moving stuff around his room. Mitchell gave me
               the key for the room and I heard a lot of glass breaking in the
               room. I told Allen that I was going to open the door and when I
               did I wanted him to have his hands up. I keyed into the room
               and pushed the door open. The door opened a few inches before I
               felt something try and push the door back closed. Believing
               Allen was trying to prevent me from opening the door I kicked
               the door. When the door flew open, I saw Allen standing near
               the door, and watched as the corner of the door hit Allen in
               the forehead. Allen fell backwards and landed in a sitting
               position facing me. I told Allen to put his hands up and he
               did. I grabbed ahold of Allen's wrist and told him to put his
               hands behind his back. Allen began to resist my control and did
               not want to put his hands behind his back. I was able to talk
               Allen into complying and Sgt. Jacobsen and I were able to get
               Allen handcuffed. Once Allen was handcuffed I noticed the state
               of Allen's room. Allen's room appeared as if a tornado had hit
               it. The entirety of Allen's floor was covered in broken and
               smashed items. There was a large amount of broken glass, dirty
               food containers, and other assorted unsanitary items. It looked
               as if Allen had destroyed most if not all of his property in
               the room. One I stood Allen up I noticed an approximately 4
               inch long laceration to Allen's head that was bleeding. I also

               noticed several small cuts that were bleeding on Allen's feet.
               It appeared as if Allen had been walking on the broken glass
               for a while. I asked Allen if the cut to his head was from the
               door hitting him. Allen said no he had headbutted a glass
               mirror. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this ____ day of _____________, 2014, in
