               report of malicious mischief in Sloan Hall. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 10-13-2014 at about
               0859 hrs I was dispatched to a report of malicious mischief in
               Sloan Hall, located at 405 NE Spokane Street. Dispatch advised
               that the damage was in the 1st floor men's restroom. I arrived
               on scene and located the damage. I saw that someone had used a
               black marker to write the following statement on the partition
               between the toilet stalls: "Muslims are Cockroaches" "Large Can
               of Raid Necessary" The men's restroom is located on the 1st
               floor, directly across the hallway from room #175. The damage
               is estimated to be $25.00 and occurred sometime between 0630
               hrs and 0845 hrs on 10-13-2014. The approximate time frame
               information was obtained from the custodian. I photographed the
               damage, and the photographs have been downloaded into Spillman
               and attached to this case. Two similar incidents have been
               reported. See related cases #14-W3679 and #14-W3956. WSU
               Facilities Operations is aware of the damage and will clean it
               up. No suspects or leads were identified. I will request that
               the police department assign a plain clothes security or police
               officer to patrol the area next week. No further action at this
               time. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this __13__ day of

               was dispatched to a burglary alarm at Beasley Coliseum, located
               at 925 NE North Fairway Road. Dispatch advised that the alarm
               had originated from the administration offices, room #110. I
               arrived on scene and determined that the exterior doors to the
               administration offices were all locked. I entered the offices
               and searched the interior. The offices were unoccupied, and
               nothing appeared to be out of place. I contacted Leo A. Udy
               (DOB 03-25-1956) on the telephone. Udy is the director of the
               coliseum, and is responsible for the premises. Udy instructed
               me to secure the offices and reset the alarm, which I did. The
               alarm was apparently caused by alarm malfunction. I cleared the
               scene. No further action at this time. Olmstead/339 I certify

               Conduct Poss. of Marijuana 2. Ivan R. Macedo 07/22/96 Student
               Conduct Poss. of Marijuana NARRATIVE: On 10/13/14 at
               approximately 2135 hours, I was dispatched to a drugs call at
               Gannon Hall room 106. The RED on duty, Britteny L. Alspach,
               called stating that she could smell the odor of marijuana
               coming from room 106. Upon arrival Alspach walked me to room
               106. I smelled the crack of the door and could smell the odor
               of burnt marijuana coming from within the room. I knocked on
               the door for several minutes but no one answered. While
               standing at the room I could not hear any movement inside the
               room. With the assistance of the floor RA, I obtained the names
               Wisam S. Nakour 01/13/96 and Ivan R. Macedo 07/22/96 as the
               occupants of room 106. This matched the names on the door
               decoration on door 106. Based on the odor of marijuana coming
               from the room and the violations of the housing contract, both
               males will be referred to student conduct. END OF REPORT I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 14th day of October, 2014, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer
