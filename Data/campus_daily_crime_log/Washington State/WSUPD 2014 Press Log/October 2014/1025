               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W4328 SYNOPSIS: Qasim Mustafa Ali (DOB
               07-10-1993) reported that he lost his cellular telephone. The
               telephone was recovered in Community-Duncan Dunn Hall. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 10-25-2014 at
               about 1711 hrs I was dispatched to a report of lost property in
               Community-Duncan Dunn Hall, located at 720 NE B Street.
               Dispatch advised that the complainant, Qasim Mustafa Ali (DOB
               07-10-1993), reported that he lost his cellular telephone.
               Dispatch stated that the case was initially given to Officer
               McNannay at the Pullman Police Department. Officer McNannay
               advised that the missing telephone had been tracked to
               Community-Duncan Dunn Hall and suggested that a WSUPD officer
               handle the case. I contacted Qasim on the telephone. Qasim
               stated that sometime between 2100 hrs and 2300 hrs on 10-24-
               2014 he lost his cellular telephone at the Pimlico Apartments
               in Pullman, Washington. Qasim described his cellular telephone
               as: iPhone 6, 16GB, gold in color, SN# 352072069474099, 509-
               715-9907. Qasim stated that the value of the telephone was
               $700.00. Qasim said he activated the "Find My iPhone"
               application on his missing telephone, and the tracking
               information showed that it was currently located in Community-
               Duncan Dunn Hall. With Qasim's assistance, I logged into his
               iCloud account on the laptop computer in my patrol vehicle. The
               program indicated that Qasim's telephone was currently located
               in Community-Duncan Dunn Hall. I photographed the screen of my
               laptop computer, which showed the location of Qasim's
               telephone. The photographs have been downloaded into Spillman
               and attached to this case. I told Qasim that I would respond to
               Community-Duncan Dunn Hall and would begin walking through each
               of the floors. I told Qasim that I would stay on the telephone
               with him as I walked through the building and instructed him to
               remotely activate the alert tones on his missing telephone. I
               told Qasim that I would listen for the alert tones on his
               telephone and hopefully be able to locate which room it was in.
               At about 1748 hrs I arrived at Community-Duncan Dunn Hall and
               began systematically walking through the building, while Qasim
               remotely activated the alert tones on his missing telephone.
               Qasim told me that he was also able to remotely lock his
               cellular telephone and configured it to display a message
               requesting whoever found it to call his friend's telephone. At
               about 1815 hrs Qasim advised that someone was calling his
               friend's telephone. Qasim answered the call and spoke to a
               male. The male stated that he had Qasim's telephone and was in

               Community-Duncan Dunn Hall. The male told Qasim he had to go
               right now but would call him back later. Qasim told me the
               incoming number for the male caller was 818-970-5038. I
               provided the telephone number to Corporal Daniels, who was at
               the police department. I asked her to attempt to identify a
               person associated with the number. Corporal Daniels advised
               that Zachary S. Edwards (DOB 05-30-1995) was associated with
               the telephone number. Corporal Daniels advised that Edwards
               resided at Community-Duncan Dunn Hall #230. At about 1832 hrs I
               arrived outside room #230 and could hear the alert tones from
               Qasim's missing telephone originating from inside the room.
               There was no answer when I knocked on the door, and I contacted
               Edwards on the telephone. I asked Edwards to meet me in the
               hallway outside his room, which he did. I questioned Edwards
               about Qasim's telephone. Edwards stated that he found Qasim's
               telephone on the ground in an apartment complex and took it
               back to his residence hall room. Edwards said the words on the
               telephone were in Arabic, and he was not sure how to find the
               owner. Edwards explained that he had no intention of keeping it
               and wanted to return the telephone to the owner. Edwards said
               he returned to his room a few minutes ago and heard the alert
               tones. He looked at the telephone and called the number
               displayed on the screen. Edwards said he spoke to Qasim and
               told him he would call back after he was finished visiting with
               his parents. Edwards was irritable and angry and appeared to be
               upset that Qasim had called the police. Edwards said he did not
               trust the police and thought he should have received a thank
               you from Qasim. Edwards repeatedly stated, "no good deed goes
               unpunished". Edwards requested that I deliver a message to
               Qasim and tell him to "fuck off". Edwards said he would never
               pick up someone else's property again. I tried to explain to
               Edwards that he was being ridiculous and his bad attitude was
               unfortunate. I counseled Edwards for his behavior and offered
               some suggestions on how he could have handled this situation
               better. I told Edwards that if he wanted to avoid police
               scrutiny in the future, maybe he should simply turn over any
               valuable property he finds to a police department or lost and
               found depository, rather than take items that don't belong to
               him back to his residence. Edwards gave me Qasim's telephone,
               and I cleared the scene. I contacted Qasim and told him that I
               has recovered his telephone. I explained the situation to
               Qasim, and Qasim stated that he did not wish to pursue criminal
               charges against Edwards. Qasim said he was extremely happy to
               receive his telephone and felt the situation had been resolved.
               I arranged to meet Qasim in the Staples parking lot in Moscow,
               Idaho. At about 1915 hrs I contacted Qasim in the parking lot
               and returned his telephone. No further action at this time.

               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Dalton T. Huck 03/22/94 Warned Theft
               MIP Exhibiting Making False Statements NARRATIVE: On 10/26/14
               at approximately 0045 hours, I was driving westbound on Cougar
               Way near Hollinberry Field House when I noticed a male walking
               westbound on Cougar Way near Bolher Gym. The male, later
               identified as Dalton Troy Huck 03/22/94, was carrying two
               candlestick road cones, one over each shoulder. Believing that
               the road cones did not belong to Huck, I stopped to talk to
               him. As soon as I pulled up to Huck he put the road cones down.
               I asked Huck what he was doing with the road cones and Huck
               said he just found them. I told Huck that they were not his to
               take. Huck later admitted that he thought they would look cool
               in his apartment. While talking to Huck I could smell the odor
               of intoxicants coming from his breath. Huck's eyes were watery
               and bloodshot. Huck appeared to be under the age of 21. I asked
               Huck if he had his ID with him and he said no. I asked Huck to
               provide his name and he did so verbally. Huck spelled his name
               as, "DALTON T. HUCK." Huck also provided his date of birth as
               03/23/94. About this time Huck's father walked up. Huck's
               father, who was not identified, was asking about what was going
               on. I asked Huck's father to stand to the side while I spoke
               with Huck. I told Huck that it probably is not a good idea to
               draw attention to himself by stealing road cones if he is under
               the age of 21 and been drinking. I told Huck to wait by my
               patrol car while I ran his name. I rand Huck's information
               through dispatch and they stated there was not a return for the
               information provided. I asked Huck to spell his name again and
               he spelled it the same way as before. When I asked Huck for his
               date of birth, this time he stated it was "03/22/94" I asked
               Huck why he told me his date of birth was 03/23/94 the first
               time. Huck said he did not lie to me. I reran Huck with the new
               date of birth and he came back clear. I told Huck that I would
               not be arresting him for the theft, MIP Exhibiting, or false
               statements, however he would be sent to student conduct. Huck
               stated he understood. I told Huck he was free to go and Huck
               and his father continued their journey to greek row. The road
               cones were returned to their correct spot. END OF REPORT I

               watching over Hernandez what was going on. Hernandez's friends
               said Hernandez threw up once and was acting like she wasn't
               breathing. I walked over to Hernandez who was laying on the
               floor of room 316. Hernandez was breathing quickly as if she
               was about to hyperventilate. I told Hernandez to focus on her
               breathing which helped. Once medics arrived, they evaluated
               Hernandez and determined that she did not need to go to the
               hospital if she did not want to. Hernandez said she did not
               want to go. I spoke with Hernandez's friends who said they were
