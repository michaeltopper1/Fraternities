               run in the Terrace parking area. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 10-04-14 at approximately 1612
               hours, I responded to a cold hit and run at Terrace Apartments.
               I contacted the RP who stated this morning around 0030 hours he
               came home and parked his car on Garden behind the parking
               stalls near the F building where it was currently parked. He
               stated when he just came out to the car, he noticed the damage
               as his driver's side door would not open smoothly. I looked at
               the damage and could see it appeared someone had backed into
               the vehicle. There was damage to the front driver's side corner
               panel and driver's door. I could see some paint scrapings which
               appeared to be a metallic bluish gray with sparkle in it. I
               photograph the vehicle and asked if there had been any cars he
               thought may have done it. He stated one of the neighbors in the
               E building park a mini van that seemed that color in the stall
               across from his car. The mini van was not currently there. I
               advised him to call if he saw the van or a vehicle he thought
               may have caused the damage and he stated he would. I provided
               him a business card with the case number and I cleared. I later
               drove through the area, but the mini van he describe was still
               not there. I will continue to check for the vehicle as I
               believe it will have noticeable damage to the rear driver's
               side bumper. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 4th day of October, 2014, in

               know if there was anyone else with him under the desk or what
               he was doing. I had Holly show us were it occurred and she
               walked us to the area. There was no one in the area at the
               time. I asked her if she had any other description of the male
               and all she could tell me was he was white. She said she
               averted her eyes as soon as she saw the bare leg/butt. I
               advised her to call if they had any more issues and she stated
               they would. We all cleared. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 4th day of October,

               was working in Martin Stadium for the WSU vs California
               football game. I was standing near Gate I when I noticed a
               male, later identified as Sam B. Gillin (022895), who was
               entering the stadium and walking toward the student section.
               Gillin caught my attention because he appeared to be under the
               age of 21 and was having difficulty walking, stumbling from
               side to side. I contacted Gillin and asked how much he had to
               drink, Gillin admitted to consuming alcohol before coming to
               the game. I asked if I could check his eyes to see how much he
               had to drink and he said yes. I administered a horizontal gaze
               nystagmus test on him. I observed he had bloodshot and watery
               eyes, a lack of smooth pursuit, and a distinct and sustained
               nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes. I could smell the
               odor of intoxicants on Gillin's breath as I administered the
               test. I asked Gillin for his ID and how old he was. He said he
               was 19 and did not have his ID with him. He provided me with
               his cougar card and his date of birth. I advised Gillin he was
               under arrest for MIP exhibiting and he had the right to remain
               silent and the right to an attorney. I escorted Gillin to the
               processing room. I read Gillin an ejection notice and provided
               him with a copy of the notice. I advised him I would be
               forwarding charges for MIP to the Whitman County Prosecutor's
               office. I escorted Gillin from the Stadium and he was released.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 05 day of October, 2014, in

               NARRATIVE: On 10/04/14 at about 1908 hrs I was working in
               Martin Stadium at the WSU vs California football game. Stadium
               Command advised they saw a male on the video feed who had a
               flask/alcohol container in his boot. The male was described as
               being in section 28 about 5 rows up in the upper section. The
               male was a white male wearing a white t-shirt, jeans, with long
               brown hair. I responded to the area and located the individual,
               later identified as Saxon D. Brown (070994). Stadium Command
               verified it was the same individual. I contacted Brown and told
               him I needed to talk to him about the alcohol in his left boot.
               He started to pull it out and I could see there was an almost
               full glass flask full of what appeared to be alcohol in his
               boot. I told him just to walk with me. As we were walking down
               the stairs I asked for his ID and how old he was. As he was
               handing me his Washington Driver's License he told me he was
               20. His WADL confirmed his age. I advised him he was going to
               be under arrest for MIP and advised him of his right to remain
               silent and his right to an attorney. Once reaching the
               processing room Brown provided me with the bottle of alcohol,
               which he said was tequila. I confirmed it smelled of
               intoxicants and the bottle was poured out. I read Brown and
               ejection notice and provided him with a copy. I told Brown I
               would be forwarding charges to the prosecutor for MIP. I
               escorted Brown out of the stadium. Nothing further. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the

               Alexander D. Salud (110893), who was standing on the opposite
               side of the concourse. Salud caught my attention because he
               appeared to be under the age of 21 and appeared to be extremely
               intoxicated. Salud was standing facing the concrete wall, with
               his right hand up on the wall. He was leaning forward with his
               head down and swaying side to side while using the wall for
               balance. I contacted Salud and asked how much he had to drink
               and he said "a lot" and that he was fine. I asked if he had his
               ID with him and he said no. I asked how he got in the game and
               he said his cougar card, which his friend then provided me. I
               asked how old he was and he told me 20. Salud provided me with

               was under arrest for MIP exhibiting and escorted him to the

               Salud's wallet and found his Washington Driver's License, which
               confirmed he was under 21. I read Salud an ejection notice and
               provided him with a copy. I explained to him I would be

               what happened and she stated that Meier grabbed her by both
               shoulders and pushed her backwards. Enslow said she had never
               seen Meier before. Enslow said she did not want any charges
               pressed against Meier just for him to know that's not ok. I
               asked Enslow if at any point did she hit or pushed Meier.
               Enslow said no. I walked over to Meier who was still standing
               with Dep. Anderson. I asked Meier for his side of the story.
               Meier said he did not know why he was being pulled aside
               because he did not think he did anything. Meier said he was
               just walking through the line talking to people. I told Meier
               what had been reported to me. I asked Meier if what I had been
               told was accurate. Meier said he did not remember moving or
               pushing any girls. As Meier spoke his words were slow and
               deliberate. I could also smell the odor of intoxicants coming
               from his breath. I told Meier that Enslow did not want to press
               any charges but he was going to be ejected from the game.
               Enslow said he understood and I walked him to the processing
               room. Once at the processing room an assault case was created
               and all the parties were attached. Meier's name came back clear
               through Washington. I walked Meier out of the stadium and read
               him an ejection notice. Meier said he understood and left.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury

               Charges Forwarded MIP Exhibiting .194 2. NARRATIVE: On 10/04/14
               at approximately 2020 hours I was working the WSU football game
               at Martin Stadium. I was near Gate I when I noticed a group of
               approximately 6 individuals walking westbound towards me. One
               male in particular grabbed my attention. The male, later
               identified as Glenn M. Steiner 12/07/95, was stumbling side to
               side as he walked towards me. Steiner was talking to his
               friends while walking and his movements appeared to be very
               exaggerated. Steiner's group stopped walking but Steiner had
               not noticed. After a few seconds Steiner noticed his group had
               stopped and noticed I was looking at him. As soon as Steiner
               made eye contact with me he quickly turned around in another
               exaggerated motion. Steiner appeared to be well under the age
               of 21. About 45 seconds later Steiner's group started to walk
               towards me. As soon as they reached where I was standing I told
               Steiner that I needed to speak with him. I told Steiner what I
               had observed. I asked Steiner if he had his ID with him and he
               said no. I asked Steiner how he got into the WSU football game
               without a WSU cougar card. Steiner said he walked in with
               friends. I asked Steiner if he used his cougar card to gain
               access to the game. Steiner said no. I asked Steiner if he
               illegally entered the game since he did not have a ticket or a
               cougar card to enter the game. Steiner replied, "technically I
               guess." I again asked Steiner if he had any forms of ID with
               him. Steiner said he did not. I asked Steiner how old he was
               and Steiner said, "18." I asked for Steiner to provide his
               information verbally. Steiner verbally told me his name was
               "MICHAEL GLENN STEINER 12/07/95." It was later determined that
               Steiner had purposefully lied and told me his middle name as
               his first and his first as his middle. I asked Steiner how much
               he had to drink. Steiner said he "prefunked" at a fraternity
               live out and he "drank a lot." I asked Steiner if I could look
               at his eyes and he said I could. I told Steiner to follow the
               tip of my pen with his eyes only and not to move his head.
               Steiner said he understood. As soon as I moved my pen Steiner
               moved his head to follow the pen. I again told Steiner not to
               move his head. During the HGN test I observed, equal tracking,
               lack of smooth pursuit, and distinct and sustained nystagmus at
               maximum deviation in both eyes. Several times Steiner would
               look past my shoulder instead of the pen. Steiner's eyes were

               watery and bloodshot. As Steiner stood before me I could
               clearly smell the odor of intoxicants coming from his breath. I
               asked Steiner if he was willing to provide a PBT sample.
               Steiner said he would. I found my PBT (Alco-Sensor FST #16805)
               in working condition. Steiner provided a PBT sample of .194. I
               told Steiner that he was under arrest for MIP and handcuffed
               (D/L) him. I walked Steiner to the processing room. Once at the
               processing room Steiner was searched incident to arrest. One of
               the items removed from Steiner's pockets was his wallet. Inside
               the wallet I found Steiner's Washington State Driver's License
               with the name GLENN MICHAEL STEINER 12/07/95 printed on it.
               Ofc. Kirshner ran Steiner's driver's license through dispatch
               and they found a current return for him. It was absolutely
               clear that Steiner lied about his name. I read Steiner his
               Miranda Rights of my department issued card. Steiner stated he
               understood his rights and having them in mind still wished to
               speak with me. I asked Steiner how he got into the football
               game. Steiner said, "to be honest sir, I'm intoxicated and I do
               not know." Inside of Steiner's wallet was his WSU cougar card
               that he would have used to enter the game. I gave Steiner the
               benefit of the doubt and told him he probably used his cougar
               card to get into the game. I told Steiner that I would be
               forwarding charges to the prosecutor. Steiner said he
               understood. I explained the process to Steiner. I walked
               Steiner out of the Stadium and read him an ejection notice.
               Steiner was released to one of his sober friends and I cleared.

               at approximately 0330 hours, I responded to Community Hall, 3rd
               floor, women's bathroom where an RA had found West unconscious
               on the ground. Upon arrival I found West still laying on the

               was fine. I asked West how much she had to drink and she said
               she could not remember. I asked why she could not remember.
               West stated she was at a fraternity live out and nobody stopped
               her from drinking so she had a lot. I asked West a series of
               questions to determine her mental status. West was able to
               answer all my questions correctly without hesitation. Through
               my talking with West she did not appear to be highly
               intoxicated. Once medics arrived they evaluated West and said
               she did not need medical treatment. The medics walked West to
               her room and told her to go to bed. Once the medics had West go
