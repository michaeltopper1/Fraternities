    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Olmstead/339 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W4224 SYNOPSIS: Wendy Bautista (DOB 10-
               08-1980) reported an erratically driven vehicle. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 10-20-2014 at
               about 0856 hrs I was dispatched to a report of an erratically
               driven vehicle on State Route 270 near the intersection of
               Terre View Drive. The complainant, Wendy Bautista (DOB 10-08-
               1980), reported that the vehicle was all over the road and had
               crossed the center line. Bautista also stated she believed the
               driver was using her cellular telephone. The vehicle was
               identified as a white, 2012 Hyundai Sante Fe (WA Lic. N160207).
               Dispatch advised that the vehicle had turned onto Stadium Way.
               I located the vehicle on Stadium Way at the intersection of
               Ferdinand's Lane. I stopped the vehicle and contacted the
               driver, who was identified as Nicole M. Mahan (DOB 09-16-1994).
               I advised Mahan of the reason for the traffic stop and
               questioned her about her driving. Mahan told me she had not
               been using her cellular telephone and did not believe her
               driving had been hazardous. Officer Chamberlin from the Pullman
               Police Department arrived on scene. After discussing the
               situation with Officer Chamberlin, it was decided that Mahan
               would be warned for her driving. I re-contacted Mahan, warned
               her about hazardous driving, and discussed the importance of
               driving safely. Officer Chamberlin and I cleared the scene. No
               further action at this time. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W4230 10/20/14 SYNOPSIS: Microwave was
               smoking at Food Sciences Human Nutrition building. No actual
               fire or flames. Microwave was disabled and removed from
               building. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE:
               On October 20, 2014 at about 1550 hours Pullman Fire and WSU
               Police were dispatched to a report of a microwave fire that was
               extinguished at Food Sciences Human Nutrition 302A. I responded
               to the building. The fire alarm was not in alarm status when I
               arrived. I made my way up to room 302A. Occupants told me that
               someone was warming water in a coffee cup. The countertop
               microwave began smoking heavily. An employee unplugged the
               unit. Nobody ever saw any flames, just smoke. Employees believe
               that the convection and microwave were both on simultaneously.
               The microwave is Sharp Carousel convection and microwave oven.
               According to the sticker on the back of the unit it was
               manufactured in July 1981. The Model is a R-8310 and serial
               number 60871. The convection/microwave oven is 120V A.C.;
               1.6KW; 60Hz; Single Phase; Output of 650W / 2450 MHz. Pullman
               Fire personnel used a thermal imaging device to determine there
               was no heat/fire in the surrounding walls and cupboards. FSHN
               staff asked for the unit to be removed from the building. I
               assisted Pullman Fire with removing the unit. The cord was cut
               and the oven was disposed of in the dumpster. The microwave
               oven is valued at $10.00. There was no other damage. There was
               no actual fire, thus no fire classification. No further
               investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 20th day of October, 2014, in

               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 102014
               around 1654 hrs I was dispatched to a report of an unidentified
               male who had stopped by room 411 of Bustad Hall looking for the
               office partner of the complainant, Tri K Sari (011184). I
               attempted to contact the complainant and was unsuccessful
               before I went to room 411 of Bustad Hall. Upon my arrival I was
               not able to locate Sari and asked Whitcom to try and contact
               her. The were also unsuccessful and I walked around to see if
               she was in one of the labs on the 4th floor. Prior to leaving
               the building after not locating Sari I stopped by room 411 one
               more time. I noticed her office partners name was listed at
               George Wudiri and upon my return to the WSU Police Department I
               tried to contact Sari again without success. I later contacted
               Wudiri and he explained he had been contacted by Sari.
               Initially he did not recognize the name of the individual who
               had contacted her but as we continued to speak he told me he
               recognized him as an old friend who had just wanted to
               reconnect. He went on to tell me there was nothing suspicious
               about the male. I explained I had not been able to reach Sari
               regarding this case and asked him if he would convey the
               information to her as well. He told me he would and I cleared.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 20th day of October, 2014, in

               room 470 of Fulmer Hall. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR#
               1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 102014 around 1745 hrs I responded to a
               report of a stolen laptop computer from room 470 of Fulmer
               Hall. Upon my arrival I contacted the reporting party, later
               identified as Charles G Murray (020283), who told me the
               following. Murray explained he had gone to a seminar from 1610-
               1700 hrs. During that time he had left his Apple Macbook Pro
               sitting on his desk in the lab. When he returned he noticed the
               computer, along with the charger were missing. I asked him if
               he had any idea who had taken it and he told me he did not. He
               went on to explain nothing else seemed to have been disturbed
               on his desk. When asked what was on the laptop he told me his
               research he had been working on. I asked if he was currently
               teaching classes or acting as a teaching assistant and was told
               he was a teaching assistant. I asked when the next round of
               tests was scheduled and he told me it was in about two weeks.
               He went on to explain he has not even seen the test at this
               point and did not have a copy of it on his computer. We
               continued to speak during which point I asked if anyone else
               had been in the area while he was gone. An individual, later
               identified as Ryan Joseph (062378), who was standing in the lab
               told me he had been working next door in the lab during this
               time frame. When I asked him about anyone else in the area he
               told me he had not seen or heard anyone. At this point I
               returned to speaking with Murray and asked him about security
               measures on his laptop. He told me he had not downloaded
               anything and not activated anything other than what had been
               installed from the factory on it. I asked him to try and get me
               the serial number and Mac Address for the machine so I could
               enter it as a stolen article. He told me he would work on it

               reference. I also told him if he happened to locate the laptop
               to let me know and I would remove it from our system as well as
               to give me a call if he had any further questions. He told me

               WSU Police Department I emailed information technologies and
               asked them to flag Murray's laptop in hopes of locating it and
               will await further information on Murray's laptop before having
               it entered as being stolen. Around 1900 hrs I received an email
               from Murray. Included were the serial number for the Macbook
               Pro (C02M42EHFD59), as well as the model number (A1398). I have
