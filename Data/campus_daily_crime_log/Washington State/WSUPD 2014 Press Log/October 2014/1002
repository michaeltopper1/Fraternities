               Phone company contacted and advise given. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Akanksha N. Thorave 02/15/96 Victim 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 10/02/14 at approximately 1045 hours I met with
               the reporting party, Akanksha Thorave, in the WSUPD lobby
               reference unwanted phone calls. Thorave showed me her phone log
               from the previous night (10/01/14) between 2300 and 0200 hours.
               The calls were from "unknown" or "no caller id". Thorave showed
               me a few calls during the same time period from a friend named
               Pulkit. Thorave said she found this odd so called Pulkit.
               Pulkit told Thorave that he was not calling her and did not
               have any calls on his log as outgoing to her. Pulkit explained
               to Thorave that there are "aps" on line available to have other
               people's phone numbers show up when calling people. Thorave
               said she continued to receive calls after talking with Pulkit
               and a caller ID # of 886 2-3429266 (which is a number from
               Taiwan according to Google). I asked Thorave if anyone would
               speak on the other end and she said it was always silent.
               Thorave said she called her friends to come pick her up because
               she lives alone and did not know if someone was intentionally
               caller her. Thorave said when she was with her friends the
               calls would continue and the friends would answer, but still no
               one was on the other line. I explained to Thorave that should
               could call her phone company (AT&T) and they might be able to
               figure out where the unknown calls were coming from. Thorave
               asked if she could call them while I was there and I said she
               could, which she did. Thorave spoke with Bonnie who explained
               that AT&T would not be able to determine the phone number. I
               explained several options to Thorave. I told her that she could
               change her phone number and selectively give it to her friends
               over a period of days to see if the calls continued after
               giving it out to certain people. I told Thorave she could also
               wait over night and see if the calls continued tonight. I also
               gave Thorave the option of me contacting Pulkit and talking
               with him about the situation. Thorave said she did not want me
               to talk with Pulkit because she did not think it was him as he
               stated she could contact the police and he would cooperate with
               them if needed. Thorave said she would wait on it to see if she
               gets any further calls, and if she does she will be back in
               contact with me. I asked Thorave if anything has recently
               happened between her and her friends that would upset someone
               or cause them to bother her and she said no. I told Thorave

               GARDNER, Kelsey R. (10/01/91) NARRATIVE: On October 2, 2014 at
               about 1123 hours I was dispatched to a hit and run collision
               near Carpenter Hall. I responded to the area and contacted the
               witness by telephone. Gardner told me she saw a green Ford
               Windstar van back into a silver Chevrolet truck and drive
               forward into a black vehicle. The van was driven by a male.
               Gardner said the van was trying to get out of the parallel
               parking space. She said the driver knew he hit the vehicles
               because he looked at her when he hit them. The van then drove
               away to the Yellow parking lot on Washington Street next to WSU
               Health and Wellness. Gardner called the police and left notes
               on both of the vehicles that were hit by the van. The driver
               did not get out to look at the vehicles and did not leave notes
               according to Gardner. I located the truck and black Toyota
               parked on the west side of Spokane Street just east of the
               Washington/Spokane intersection. I photographed the vehicles.
               They both were legally parked. The distance between the front
               bumper of the truck and the rear bumper of the car was about
               twenty (20) feet. The only notes left on the truck and car were
               from Gardner. I located the van parked in the Yellow lot. I
               photographed the van. It had damage to every side of it. The
               driver was not with the vehicle. I contacted the owner of the
               truck, Justin M. Rink (05/06/94) by telephone at about 1300
               hours. He told me the front bumper was dented on the driver's
               side and the license plate and license plate holder were
               dented. This was all new damage. He parked his truck at about
               0950 hours this morning. The damage was not there when he
               parked. There were no vehicles in front of his when he parked.
               I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws
               of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this ____ day of _____________, 2014 in Pullman,

               harassment. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 10-02-14 at approximately 2023 hours, I was
               contacted by RED, Brittany Griffin, who stated one of her RA's
               is possibly being harassed by a male who is a WSU Police
               Intern. I went with her to the RA's room and contacted,
               Samantha Kerney. Sam stated in high school she dated one of our
               current Interns, Delfino Dominquez. She stated they broke up
               around her sophomore year and they have kind of been friends
               since then. She stated last year she lived in Stephenson East
               and Delfino lived in Stephenson South. She stated she started
               getting weird phone calls from a male who she thought was
               Delfino, but she wasn't sure as the caller ID said Private or
               Blocked. She stated at first the calls were sexual in nature
               and she didn't want to go into detail about what was said. She
               then began getting calls when she would turn off her lights to
               go to bed and the caller would say things like, I hope you
               sleep well, or have a good night. She said occasionally she
               would get calls in the morning and the male would say things
               like, I hope you have a good day today. She said the calls
               bothered her, but they never gave a name and the caller ID was
               always blocked. She stated she thought the callers voice
               sounded like Delfino, but she wasn't sure. She said she had
               told Delfino in the past not to talk to her, because he would
               be demeaning or derogatory. She said she never told him to not
               contact her. She said about three weeks ago she found a note
               under her door from Delfino. She said she had thrown the note
               away, but it said something to the effect of there was a party
               he was inviting her to and he left his phone number telling her
               to call or text him. She also said she had gotten a parking
               ticket on 09-02-14 and when she went in to pay it on the 19th,
               it had already been paid. She said her parents did not pay it
               and she has no idea who did. Sam said she never felt threatened
               by Delfino and did not believe he was dangerous. She said based
               on everything, she just didn't want him to contact her anymore.
               She was also concerned how he knew where she lived. She stated
               it was possible he found out through mutual friends, but she
               didn't think she had told him. She was concerned he may have
               gotten the information through working for WSU PD. I assured
               her he would not have access to that type of information as an
               Intern. I talked with Sam about her options for protection type
               orders and she stated she understood. I also advised her I
               would talk with Delfino and advise him to not contact her. If

               he did, I wanted her to let me know and she said she would. She
               stated she didn't want any kind of charges against him, just
               didn't want him to contact her anymore. She was given my
               contact information and I cleared. I contacted Delfino by phone
               and asked if he could meet with me. He stated he was in a lab,
               but could meet with me after. At approximately 2200 hours, I
               met with him at WSU PD. We went into an office and I closed the
               door for privacy. I advised him he was free to leave at
               anytime, and he stated he understood. I asked him to tell me
               about Sam and he stated he had dated her his freshman year of
               high school. He stated he hadn't had much contact with her
               since the summer. He admitted to leaving the note under her
               door and stated some mutual friends from high school had been
               in town and wanted her to come hangout with them. He said at
               the time he put the note under her door he had spoken to one of
               her neighbors to see if they knew where she was. I asked
               Delfino how he knew where she lived and he said she had told
               him she was going to be an RA in South when they talked over
               the summer. I asked him about any contact he had with her last
               semester and talked about calling her. He stated he never
               called her and would provide any phone records I wanted to
               prove it. I asked him if he had paid a parking ticket for her
               and he stated he barely has money to pay for his stuff and
               wouldn't have been able to pay for anything for her. I talked
               with Delfino about how she felt when he talked with her and
               discussed how teasing may have been perceived as demeaning or
               derogatory. He stated he had never intended for her to feel
               that way. I advised Delfino, Sam no longer wanted any contact
               from him. We discussed the consequences he would face if he
               tried to contact her whether in person or through a third
               party, and he stated he understood. He stated he thought they
               had an amicable relationship and had never thought she didn't
               want to be friends anymore. He stated he would not contact her
               any further. Delfino appeared to be very truthful during our
               conversation and I did not detect any signs of dishonesty. I
               thanked him for speaking with me and he left. I later looked at
               the parking ticket information and sent an email to Parking
               Services to see if they could tell who had paid the ticket. I
               will follow up with Sam regarding my conversation with Delfino
               and my concern someone else may be harassing/stalking her.
               Investigation continues. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 2nd day of October,
               2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               female vomiting in the front lobby. We contacted the female who
               was with friends and hall staff. The female was conscious and I
               could smell and extremely overwhelming odor of intoxicants
               emitting from her. Her speech was very slurred as she spoke and
               she had a hard time sitting up on her own. I asked her a few
               questions and she was not able to answer them correctly. I
               asked her to take a PBT and on a poor breath sample a reading
               of .288 was observed. Medics arrived and evaluated her. She
               voluntarily was transported to PRH by Medics. I did not
               identify the female and cleared when medics advised we could
               leave. Hall staff stated they were documenting the incident. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of

               CASE #: 14-W3888 SYNOPSIS: Subject arrested, cited, and
               released for MIP Exhibiting. Incident sent to student conduct.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Keira R. Wingate/022296
               Cite/release MIP Exhibiting 2. NARRATIVE: On 10/03/14 at about
               0038 hrs I was driving westbound on Washington St. from Nevada
               St. when I noticed a group of three females standing near the
               Washington Building. The group caught my attention because one
               of the females, later identified as Keria R. Wingate (022296),
               was bent over and appeared to be vomiting. I turned around and
               observed the females walking southbound along Washington St.
               Wingate appeared to be stumbling side to side and receiving
               help balancing from the other two females. I pulled into a
               parking lot at the old ER entrance to the Washington Building.
               As they were walking toward me I could see Wingate appeared to
               be under the age of 21. I contacted them and asked if I could
               speak with them. I told them I was concerned with how much
               Wingate had to drink. Wingate admitted to having consumed
               alcohol but said she was fine. Wingate swayed side to side as
               she stood and spoke with slurred speech. I asked Wingate if I
               could check her eyes to see how much she had to drink and she
               agreed. I administered a horizontal gaze nystagmus test on her
               and observed she had bloodshot and watery eyes, a lack of
               smooth pursuit, and a distinct and sustained nystagmus at
               maximum devaition. I had I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this ____ day of
               _____________, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.
