    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: 316 / Macy WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W4254 SYNOPSIS: Suspicious note found in
               a room. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE:
               Sara Raquet, General Manager of Residence Inn, called saying a
               maid found a suspicious note in room 103. Upon contacting
               Raquet she showed me a note reading "Help me! I've been taken,
               Call 206-707-3285, please I need help he will know what to do".
               The note was written on the second page of a Residence Inn note
               pad that had been in room 103. The maid who found the pad said
               she cleaned the room the previous day, and believed she had
               checked the pad and did not see the written note, so she
               believed it was put there last night, but she was not positive.
               I learned a Tyroc Vineyard had occupied the room for the last
               three nights. Having Vineyard's phone number I attempted
               contact three times (0953, 1009, 1024 hours)but was
               unsuccessful. At 1002 hours I called the number on the note and
               made contact with a Kyle W. Medina. Medina was in a very windy
               location so we had a hard time hearing each other. I explained
               the situation to Medina and he had no idea what the note meant,
               or why his phone number was attached to it. Medina had no idea
               who Tyroc Vineyard was. At about 1030 hours I get a call from
               Vineyard. Vineyard saw my number on his phone and called it
               back. I learned that Vineyard and a Joshua Loper were
               contractors working on the Club House of Campus Commons South
               and had spent the last three nights at the Residence Inn in
               room 103. I met Vineyard and Loper at Campus Commons South. I
               explained the situation to them and showed them the note. Both
               individuals claimed to know nothing about the note, or its'
               meaning. They also claimed they did not know a Kyle Medina. I
               stopped by the Residence Inn and informed Raquet what I had
               learned. I asked Raquet who had stayed in the room before
               Vineyard. She told me the Renton Choral Group (a High School
               group) had a number of rooms over the weekend and four young
               men from this group occupied room 103 for Friday and Saturday
               nights. The last name of the four individuals were Gomez,
               Jimenez, Koman and Medina. Medina is also the last name
               belonging to the phone number on the note. I call Kyle Medina
               back at about 1130 hours. I asked Medina if he was from the
               Renton area, which he said he was. I asked if he happened to
               know anyone belonging to the Renton Choral Group, which he said
               he did. I asked if he happen to know a Gomez, Jimenez, Koman or
               Medina. At this time it was as if I heard a light come on in
               his voice. He said he knew Gomez, Jimenez, not sure about
               Koman, and yes he knew Medina, his younger brother, Devin.

               Medina told me things were starting to make sense to him. He
               said he knew the Renton Choral Group was "over here" last
               weekend and his brother is in the group. Given the clue "over
               here" I asked Medina if he was a WSU student, and he told me he
               was. In our hard to hear each other prior conversation Medina
               mentioned he was from the West side, but I failed to ask where
               he currently was. Kyle Medina lives in Streit 209. Medina said
               he would prefer the group not get into a lot of trouble, but he
               would gladly give me the Choral groups director's name and
               phone number. Medina gave me a name of Bryan Hoskins and phone
               number, 253-222-4226. This was the same name and number that
               Raquet had for the responsible of the Choral Group while at the
               Residence Inn. I told Medina I would contact Hoskins, inform
               him of the situation and let him deal with it from there. I
               attempted contact with Hoskins, but was unsuccessful. A message
               was left requesting he contact me. I contacted Raquet and
               Vineyard and let them know what I had learned. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               of room 409 and identified myself. A male, Shawn Michael Reilly
               02/14/96, answered the door. I told Reilly that I was coming
               into the room and found the female, Sarah Christine Essary
               05/18/96, sitting near one of the beds. I told Essary to go
               into the hallway to speak with Ofc. Welter while I interviewed
               Reilly. I asked Reilly what was going on and he stated that he
               was having an argument with Essary. Reilly said that he had sex
               with another female about two months ago and Essary found out
               today that he had cheated on her. Reilly said they have been
               arguing in Essary's room for about the last two hours. I asked
               Essary how long he has been dating Essary and he said about a
               year and a half. I noticed dried blood on Reilly's fingers and
               a few spots on his forearms. I asked Reilly about the blood.
               Reilly said Essary had smashed a picture frame on the ground
               out of anger and Essary had cut her hand on the glass. Reilly
               said he was not cut but got Essary's blood on him when helping
               Essary pick up the glass. I asked Reilly if at any point was he
               hit, punched, pushed or any other forms of assault by Essary.
               Reilly said no. I asked if he had hit, punched, or pushed
               Essary and he said no. I could hear Ofc. Welter out in the
               hallway with Essary. Essary was not being cooperative with Ofc.
               Welter. I went into the hallway and told Essary that I needed
               her to answer a few questions. Essary was visibly upset and
               angry. I asked Essary about the cut to her hand and she said
               she cut it on a picture frame she smashed. After several times
               of asking Essary finally showed me the cut on her hand. Essary
               had a small superficial cut between her thumb and forefinger.
               The cut was small enough that it did not need medical
               attention. Essary was still not being cooperative but I was
               able to get her to tell me the argument was about Reilly
               cheating on her. I asked Essary if at any point was she hit,
               punched, or pushed. Essary said no. I asked Essary if at any

               point did she hit, punch, or push Reilly. Essary said she
               slapped Reilly at some point during the argument. I asked
               Essary where the slap landed on Reilly's body. Essary said she
               did not remember. Essary was again not cooperating with my
               investigation. I returned to Reilly and asked him why he did
               not tell me about the slap. Reilly said it was nothing and it
               did not hurt. Reilly stated Essary had slapped him on the left
               side of his neck. I looked at Reilly's neck but could not see
               any redness or marks. Reilly again said the slap did not hurt.
               I told Reilly that it would be best for him to return to his
               dorm room, Stephenson South room 623. I later returned to
               Stephenson South and provided Reilly with an ATVP packet. Ofc.
               Welter tried to explain to Essary that she was coming very
               close to going to jail for assault domestic violence. Essary
               said that she could put her hands on her boyfriend if she
               wanted to. Both Ofc. Welter and I attempted to inform Essary of
               the domestic violence laws but she was not listening to us any
               longer. Essary was given an ATVP packet. I warned Essary to
               leave Reilly alone for the rest of the night and to continue
               their conversation tomorrow. END OF REPORT I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of

               NARRATIVE: On 10/22/14 at approximately 2235 hours I responded
               to Northside Hall room 457 where the RED on duty, Aubrie L.
               Piper, was assisting a resident who was having issues with her
               roommate over marijuana. Upon arrival I met with Mikayla Nicole
               Presta 01/13/96 who lives in room 457. Presta stated that she
               had a new roommate move in a couple of weeks ago and the new
               roommate, Catherine Elizabeth Bardon 06/05/96, has had
               marijuana in the room. I asked Presta if she has spoken to
               Bardon about the marijuana and Presta said no. Presta stated
               she just did not know what to do. I counseled Presta about how
               she could tactfully speak with Bardon about what was acceptable
               in their shared room. Presta said she did not want Bardon to
               get into trouble but she also did not want illegal items in her
               room. I gave Presta my business card and told her that Bardon
               could contact me if she wanted to talk about the situation.
               Presta said she would talk to Bardon first and see how that
               went. When I was in Presta and Bardon's room, I could smell the
               faint odor of burnt marijuana but did not see any drugs or
               paraphernalia laying out. END OF REPORT I certify and declare

               2014 at approximately 2300 hours I was dispatched to a drugs
               call at Rogers Hall room 823. I called the Reporting Party,
               Hannah M. Mitchell, who is the Hall Director on Duty. Mitchell
               stated she was notified by RA's that room 823 in Rogers Hall
               smelled strongly of marijuana. Mitchell responded to the 8th
               floor of Rogers. Mitchell stated that as she walked closer to
               room 823 the odor of marijuana intensified and as she walked
               away from room 823 the odor of marijuana dissipated. Mitchell
               stated she smelled the surrounding doors near room 823 and it
               was clearly coming from 823. Mitchell stated on a scale of 1 to
               10, 10 being 100% positive, she was a 9 that the odor of
               marijuana was coming from room 823. On the same scale Mitchell
               stated she as 10 out of 10 sure that the odor she smelled was
               in fact marijuana. Mitchell stated that she has attended 6
               controlled burns over the last 6 years. Mitchell's last
               controlled burn was in August 2014. Since January 2014,
               Mitchell has called in four drugs calls. All four calls have
               resulted in marijuana being present in the room. There have
               been two other marijuana related drugs calls at room 823. On
               09/06/14 Ofc. Daniels found approximately 3 grams of marijuana
               and a glass bong from the room. On 10/12/14 I also responded to
               room 823 for a drugs call. I contacted Spencer Michael
               Mackenzie 04/26/96 who is the sole occupant for room 823.
               Mackenzie turned over a small amount of marijuana and a few
               pipes. I have firsthand knowledge that Mackenzie is under the
               age of 21 years old and does not have a medical marijuana
               authorization. I applied and was granted a search warrant for
               room 823 by Judge Robinson. At approximately 2345 hours Ofc.
               Welter and I served the warrant on room 823. I knocked and
               announced twice on the door without an answer. I keyed into the
               room and found nobody inside. When I entered the room, I could
               clearly smell the odor of burnt marijuana. A copy of the search
               warrant was read aloud to the room prior to searching. During
               the search the following items were found and seized: -6 small
               round plastic containers with hash oil inside -1 glass mouth
               piece with burnt GVM inside of it -1 plastic homemade bong with
               burnt GVM inside of it -1 metal grinder with GVM inside of it -

               of the items seized on the microwave on the southside of the
               room. The door to room 823 was locked up and we cleared. Once
               back at the station the marijuana NIC tested presumptive
               positive for marijuana. The seized items were logged into
               evidence. Charges of possession of marijuana less than 40 grams
               will be forwarded to the prosecutor. A return of search was

               hours I was dispatched to a parking problem at Honors Hall
               loading dock. Dispatch stated there was a red GMC Jimmy parked
               in a 30 minutes loading zone for over the 30 minute allotment.
               I took the exact same call with the exact same car the previous
               night (case 14-W4247). Due to call volume I was unable to
               respond to Honors Hall until 0045 hours. Upon arrival I found
               the Jimmy as described. I noted the time and decided to return
               30 minutes later to see if the car had moved. I returned to
               Honors hall at 0120 hours and found the Jimmy still there. I
               issued a parking citation to the Jimmy. While completing the
               citation, James R. Aguirre, came out to his car. I gave Aguirre
               the citation and explained it to him. Once Aguirre had his
               citation I cleared. END OF REPORT I certify and declare under

               Exhibiting and will be referred to student conduct. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE 1. Mackenzie L. Miller 08/04/96 Student Conduct
               MIP Exhibiting 2. NARRATIVE: On 10/23/14 at approximately 0104
               hours I was driving northbound on Thatuna Street next to Wilmer
               Davis when I noticed a car stopped in the Wilmer Davis
               unloading zone. I watched as two females tried to drag another
               female, Mackenzie Lynn Miller 08/04/96, out of the backseat of
               the car. Miller appeared to be highly intoxicated. One of the
               females had both of her arms under Miller's armpits in an
               attempt to stand Miller up. Miller appeared to be under the age
               of 21. I stopped my car and approached the three. While walking
               up to Miller I noticed she had just vomited down the front of
               her shirt and onto the ground. When I reached Miller, she had a
               large string of saliva coming from her mouth and continuing
               onto her shirt. I asked the female who was holding Miller up
               what was going on. The female said she was Miller's "big" from
               her sorority and she was just trying to get her home. I asked
               Miller several questions to determine her mental status. Miller
               was able to answer all my questions correctly. I could clearly
               smell the overpowering odor of intoxicants coming from Miller's
               breath. I asked Miller if she had a sober roommate to watch her
               and she said yes. With assistance from one female, Miller made
               it to her room, Wilmer Davis 373. Miller was not able to walk
               straight without the assistance of her friend. Once we reached
               room 373 I contacted Miller's roommate, Shannon Kendall
               Patterson 04/10/96. Patterson was sober and stated she would
               take care of Miller. I told Patterson to call 911 if Miller
               started to have any problems. Once Miller was turned over to
               Patterson I cleared. END OF REPORT I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 23rd day of
