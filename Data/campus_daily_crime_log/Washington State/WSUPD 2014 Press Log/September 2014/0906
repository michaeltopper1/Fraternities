               Palouse Ridge Golf Course Clubhouse, no fire emergency.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               September 6, 2014 at about 1238 hours Pullman Fire and WSU
               Police were dispatched to a fire alarm at the Palouse Ridge
               Golf Course Clubhouse. I responded to the building and was the
               first emergency responder to arrive on scene. I was met by the
               owner of Banyans restaurant in the parking lot. He asked me why
               it took me so long to get there. He then asked me to silence
               the alarm. I told him that I could not silence the alarm, fire
               personnel must evaluate the incident first. As I was talking
               with the owner out front, I had to stop people from entering
               the building. The alarm was sounding and lights were flashing
               on the alarms. I was told that there were diners on the patio
               still eating. A chef came out of the building just prior to
               Pullman Fire arriving on scene. I went into the building with
               the Pullman Fire personnel to find the activated smoke
               detector. I saw there were kitchen and wait staff personnel
               still working in the building even though the alarm was
               sounding. They failed to evacuate. Pullman Fire personnel and I
               determine the alarm was caused by cooking exhaust that was
               blown into a supply room by a gust of wind. The large patio
               doors were open and a rear door to the kitchen was open as they
               were loading items from the kitchen into a vehicle. This
               created a change in pressure and the cooking exhaust was not
               properly ventilated in the cooking vent hoods. There was no
               fire, flame or fire emergency. Pullman Fire personnel also
               found the mechanical room/sprinkler shut off room was
               barricaded with boxes. There was no access to the sprinkler
               shut off as someone has used the room for storage. I
               photographed the room and attached photos to the case. WSU Fire
               Marshal Holmes will be notified of the failure to evacuate and
               lack of access to the sprinkler shut offs. No further
               investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 6th day of September, 2014, in

               someone possibly smoking marijuana in a parked car near Olympia
               Hall. Prior to arrival the car had moved to the area of the
               blue lot. Once the car was located nobody was found near it.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               09/06/14 at approximately 2103 hours, Cougar Security units
               called out that they could see a green Subaru wagon in the
               parking lot. Cougar Security thought they were smoking
               marijuana in the car. While en route to the area, Cougar
               Security stated the Subaru had left the parking lot and went
               towards the blue lots. Once on scene Cougar Security found a
               green Subaru Forester and said they were pretty sure that was
               the car they saw. There was nobody around the Subaru. I looked
               through the window and did not see any signs of drug activity.
               I smelled the driver's side door and it smelled very faintly of
               burnt marijuana. I ran the license plate and it came back to a
               Teresa M Cole. I researched the last name Cole and found there
               were 39 students with the last name of Cole. Not knowing who
               was driving or what student the car belonged to I cleared.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury

               I contacted Cherise D. Wade who is the resident advisor for the
               first floor of Scott Hall. Wade told me the following. At
               approximately 2030 hours, Kimberly Conway was sitting in her
               room 110 Scott Hall when a plastic lemonade bottle filled with
               frozen liquid was thrown into the window screen which broke
               through the screen. Conway contacted Wade and asked her to
               report the incident because she had to leave for a meeting.
               Wade stated that Conway had no idea who may have caused the
               damage to the window and that she was in the process of
               completing the housing maintenance work order for the window. I
               checked the window and noticed the bottle still sticking
               through the window screen. I took photos of the damage and
               estimated the cost to replace the screen was approximately
               $50.00. case inactive pending further leads. I certify and

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W3312 SYNOPSIS: Intoxicated female
               unconscious in the Regents Hall parking lot. She was
               transported to PRH by medics. Charges to be forwarded for MIP
               Exhibiting. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Micha M.
               Jackson 11/22/95 Charges forwarded MIP Exhibiting 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 090614 at approximately 2323 hours, I was on a foot patrol
               in the area of Regents Hall when I saw two females carrying a
               highly intoxicated female toward teh entrance to Regents Hall.
               I stopped and contacted them activating my VieVu body camera.
               The female being carried was later identified as Micha M.
               Jackson, and her friend was identified as Seema Badrbigi. I
               told Seema to let Micha sit on the ground because she was
               struggling to hold Micha in a standing position. Seema helped
               Micha to the ground and she just laid on a friend completely
               unresponsive. I called her name several times and she would
               open her eyes but wasn't verbally responding to me. I asked for
               Pullman Fire Department to respond and they did. Micha smelled
               strongly of intoxicants, was spitting on herself and dry
               heaving. Seema told me that she had been drinking vodka and had
               been vomiting prior to arriving at Regents Hall. I asked Micha
               if she wanted to go to the hospital and she nodded in the
               affirmative. I advised Pullman Fire personnel that she nodded
               when asked if she would go to the hospital. Pullman medics
               conducted an evaluation on Micha and determined that she needed
               to be taken to Pullman Regional Hospital for a detox. Medics
               loaded Micha up on a gurney and transported her to PRH. Charges
               to be forwarded for MIP Exhibiting. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 8th day of
               September, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               ACTION OFFENSE PBT 1. Jared James Schneider 07/24/95 Charges
               Forwarded MIP Exhibiting .196 2. NARRATIVE: On 09/07/14 at
               approximately 0104 hours, I was driving eastbound Cougar Way
               when I noticed a male walking eastbound on Cougar Way near the
               Soccer Field. The male appeared to be intoxicated because as he
               was walking he was stumbling side to side and at one point he
               almost ran into the the fence next to him. As I paralleled the
               male I noticed he appeared to be much younger than 21 years
               old. I pulled into the Smith Parking lot and waited as the male
               walked to my location. As the male approached where I was
               standing, I asked the male if he had a second to talk. The
               male, later identified as Jared James Schneider 07/24/95,
               stopped. I asked Schneider where he was walking to and he said
               Lower Drive. I asked Schneider if he had his ID and he provided
               his WADL. Schneider's WADL identified him as 19 years old. I
               asked Schneider how much he had to drink tonight and he said
               about 2 beers with the last one being about an hour ago. I
               asked Schneider if I could check his eyes and he said I could.
               During the HGN test I observed, equal tracking, lack of smooth
               pursuit, and distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum
               deviation in both eyes. Schneider was swaying side to side as
               he stood before me. I asked Schneider to blow into my hand and
               he did. I could clearly smell the odor of intoxicants coming
               from his breath. I told Schneider that I believed he had more
               than 2 beers and asked him if he was willing to be more honest
               with me. Schneider said just 2 beers. I asked Schneider if he
               was willing to provide a PBT sample and he said he would. I
               found my PBT (Alco-Sensor FST #16805) in working condition.
               Schneider provided a PBT sample of .196. I told Schneider that
               he was under arrest for MIP Exhibiting and handcuffed (D/L)
               him. I advised Schneider of his right to counsel. Schneider was
               searched incident to arrest and no weapons or illegal items
               were found. I asked Schneider a series of questions to
               determine his mental status. Schneider was able to answer all
               of my questions correctly. I gave Schneider a ride to his house
               on Lower Drive and released him from custody. I told Schneider
               that I would be forwarding charges to the Prosecutor for MIP
               Exhibiting. Schneider said he understood. Schneider went into
               his house and I cleared. Nothing further. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
