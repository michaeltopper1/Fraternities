    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Olmstead/339 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W3662 SYNOPSIS: Clarence A. Pitzer (DOB
               03-11-1946) reported that he might have been involved in a
               vehicle collision. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 09-21-2014 at about 0758 hrs I was dispatched to
               a report of a vehicle collision that had occurred yesterday in
               the Center for Undergraduate Education (CUE) parking garage,
               located at 300 NE Troy Lane. I contacted the complainant,
               Clarence A. Pitzer (DOB 03-11-1946), on the telephone. Pitzer
               stated that on 09-20-2014 sometime between 2300 hrs and 2315
               hrs he was driving his silver, 2008 Cadillac DTS Sedan (WA Lic.
               V778WSU) on the 3rd floor of the CUE parking garage. Pitzer
               explained that the football game had just ended, and the
               parking garage was full. Pitzer said numerous other vehicles
               were backing out of their parking spaces and maneuvering around
               in the garage at the same time. Pitzer said he was backing his
               vehicle out of his parking space and noticed another vehicle
               was backing up towards him at the same time. Pitzer said he
               honked his horn, and the vehicle stopped. Pitzer explained that
               the traffic situation in the parking garage was very confusing,
               and he continued to back up. Pitzer said his wife was a
               passenger in his vehicle, and she thought he might have hit
               another vehicle. Pitzer said he did not believe he had hit
               anything and drove out of the parking garage. After returning
               home, Pitzer checked the rear bumper of his Cadillac and found
               a small dent, about the size of a silver dollar. Pitzer
               explained that he was not sure if he hit something in the
               garage or if another vehicle had struck his vehicle. Pitzer
               said he decided to report the incident to the police
               department, because it was the right thing to do. I checked
               Spillman and determined that there were no other collision
               reports from the CUE parking garage on 09-20-2014. I told
               Pitzer that I would contact him if I determined another vehicle
               had been damaged by his actions or if someone else was
               responsible for the damage to his vehicle. The damage to
               Pitzer's vehicle was estimated to be $400.00. No further action
               at this time. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this __21__ day of

               Stadium Way. I contacted the complainant, Kaitelynn M. Piazza
               (DOB 04-07-1994), on the telephone. Piazza is a resident
               adviser for Stephenson South and resides in room #305. Piazza
               reported that someone had written the statement "suck my cock"
               and drew a picture of a penis, along with a telephone number,
               on her dry erase board which is hanging from her residence hall

               0200 hrs and 0900 hrs on 09-21-2014. Piazza stated that she was
               "kind of upset" when she discovered what had happened but was
               not sure if it was targeted specifically towards her or was a
               random incident. Piazza does not have any idea who might have
               drawn on her dry erase board. Piazza provided me with a
               photograph of her dry erase board, the photograph has been
