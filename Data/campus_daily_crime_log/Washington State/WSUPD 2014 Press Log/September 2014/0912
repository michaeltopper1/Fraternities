               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Floyd P. Low 09/02/54 Subject 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 09/12/14 at approximately 1115 hours I was
               requested by WSP to respond to SR 195 just north of Albion Rd.
               for a fatality collision. WSP was requesting a DRE evaluation
               on the Commercial Vehicle Driver (per WSP policy). I arrived on
               scene and met with Trooper Blood. Trooper Blood directed me to
               the driver of the semi truck, Floyd Low. I met with Low and a
               Colfax Fire Fighter who was with him. Low was walking around
               taking pictures of his vehicle and he did not appear to have
               any injuries. The fire fighter explained that they were going
               to transport him to Whitman Community Hospital to be evaluated
               by the staff. I responded to the hospital and stood by until
               the medical staff had examined Low. During this time no
               medications were administered. I met with Low in the exam room
               and explained my role as a DRE. I explained the DRE process as
               well as WSP policy relating to serious injury and fatality
               collisions involving commercial vehicles. I explained that the
               evaluation was voluntary. I told Low at the end of the
               evaluation if I did not suspect any impairment it would be his
               choice if he wanted to provide a voluntary blood sample. Low
               said he would participate in the evaluation. At the end of the
               evaluation it was my opinion Low was not under the influence of
               intoxicating liquor and/or drugs. I asked Low if he wanted to
               provide a blood sample and he said he did. I watched as the lab
               technician, Olaus Walsh, cleaned the crook of Low's left arm
               with a soap and water solution. I watched as Walsh drew blood
               into the two grey top vials at 1316 hours, which I provided to
               him. Walsh and I both labeled the vials and I took custody of
               them. Low wanted to take a DOT certified urinalysis so I
               transported him to the Whitman Health Clinic where this was
               performed. I transported Low back to the scene of the
               collision. I asked Trooper Blood if there was anything else he
               needed from me and he said I could clear. I returned to WSUPD
               and logged the blood samples into evidence to be sent to the
               toxicologist. See supplement for complete details. Case can be
               forwarded to WSP while the blood results are pending. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.

               NARRATIVE: On 091214 at approximately 2056 Cpl. Daniels
               informed Sgt. Griffin she was en route to meet Ofc. McNannay
               who had started investigating a collision that occurred in our
               jurisdiction, however, she diverted to another call. Sgt.
               Griffin asked me to contact Ofc. McNannay. I contacted him via
               radio and he later called my cell phone. He had determined the
               vicitim's vehicle had been struck in our jurisdiction. He said
               he had video of the damaged vehicle he would send me. The
               damaged vehicle had a note left on it. I called the victim,
               Derek J. Sires (060282), who confirmed he had been parked in
               the 3 parking spot to the east of B St on NE Campus St. He
               stated his vehicle suffered several small white scratches on
               the passenger side rear bumper. He sent me 3 photographs. He
               provided me with his insurance information. I gave him my
               contact information and his case number. Sires stated he had
               already spoken with the person who left the note, Trevor G.
               McLam (030793). He said McLam had been cordial and provided him
               with information. I then called McLam who told me that at
               approximately 1045 hours he was trying to parallel park when he
               misjudged the distance and struck sires vehicle with his
               driver's side front passenger bumper. He stated he was wearing
               his seatbelt and there was no airbag deployment. He was not
               injured, nor was his passenger, an unidentified Alexis
               Martinez. McLam said he had less than $50 damage to his bumper
               and thought the same for Sires damage. He was unable to locate
               a current insurance card so I provided him with the case number
               and my contact information for him to email me. Case pending
               insurance information. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 12th day of

               Goodman/040796 arrest/forward cgs MIP Exhibiting 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 09/12/14 at about 2218 hrs I was driving eastbound on Campus
               St. near McCrosky Hall when I noticed two males who were
               walking eastbound along Campus St. They caught my attention
               because one of the males, later identified as Kyle R. Goodman
               (040796), was having difficulty walking, stumbling side to side
               as he walked even with assistance from his friend. I noticed
               Goodman appeared to be under the age of 21. I contacted Goodman
               as they reached the corner of Veterans Way and Campus St. I
               asked how much he had to drink and he denied having had
               anything. I asked if I could look at his eyes and he said no.
               As he was speaking with me I could smell the odor of
               intoxicants on his breath. Goodman swayed side to side as he
               stood and spoke with slurred speech. Goodman said he did not
               have his ID with him but provided his name and date of birth,
               which confirmed he was under 21. I advised Goodman he was under
               arrest for MIP Exhibiting. I placed him in handcuffs (double
               locked). I advised him of his right to remain silent and his
               right to an attorney. Search incident to arrest I located an
               almost full half gallon of vodka in Goodman's backpack which he
               was wearing. I confirmed the information Goodman provided for
               his name and date of birth through Dispatch. I had Goodman pour
               out the vodka and he was released to his friend. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 13 day of September, 2014, in Pullman,

               I was out on foot near Honors Hall on Campus St. I was talking
               to Interns Cody-Berry and Carey when I heard a loud voice up
               the street by Community-Duncan Dunn Hall. I looked up and saw
               Kelsey R. Woodling (040996) walking down the street towards me
               on the other side of the street. Her gait appeared to be
               unsteady. I walked towards her and saw that she appeared to be
               under 21 and had bloodshot and watery eyes. I asked how Woodley
               was doing and she said she was fine. She was on her way to
               Kappa Delta. I could smell the odor of intoxicants on her
               breath as she spoke. She provided me with her Cougar Card and
               informed me of her underage birthdate. I checked her eyes and
               observed a lack of smooth and distinct and sustained nystagmus
               in both eyes. Woodling admitted to consuming vodka. Woodling
               was aware of her surroundings and other key factors, however, I
               had to repeat myself frequently and she had trouble remembering
               what I told her. She refused to provide a PBT sample. I
               informed Woodling I would be forwarding charges of MIP-
               Exhibiting to the Prosecutor's office and they would decide if
               they were charging her. She was informed she would be dealing
               with Student Conduct as well. I escorted her back to her
               residence hall and cleared after explaining things to her
               again. Charges to be forwarded. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 13th day of

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W3428 SYNOPSIS: Report of a suicide
               attempt. Subject was placed in protective custody and
               transported to PRH by medics. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 09-12-14 at approximately 2342
               hours, I responded to Streit Hall 513 for the report of a
               suicide attempt. Whitcom stated the female had cut her wrists.
               I activated my Axon camera. As I arrived, I saw the female
               laying on the floor and subjects were holding her wrists. I
               took over holding her arms which had clothing wrapped around
               them. I could see a large amount of blood on the floor,
               including some clots of blood. The female, later identified as
               Shelby L. Valaer (07-19-96), had several cuts to her right
               wrist. The cuts appeared to be in several directions and were
               still bleeding. Her left wrist had blood and a one or two cuts.
               We also later found several cuts to her left hip. I immediately
               applied direct pressure to both wrists and held her to the
               floor. She was semi conscious and I began asking her questions.
               She repeated several times, "just let me die" and "I want to
               die". I asked her what she had used to cut herself and she said
               she didn't know. I also asked her where the razor or knife was
               and she said she didn't know. Shelby seemed to go in and out of
               consciousness. I also asked her if she had a history of
               depression and she said yes. She stated she used to take
               medication, but wasn't taking it currently. She admitted to
               having four shots of alcohol, but wouldn't say what she had
               drank. After a few minutes, Sgt. Jacobson and Ofc. Petlovany
               applied tourniquets to both arms. I continued to hold her
               wrists. When medics arrived, they had us remove the tourniquets
               to look at the cuts. The bleeding seemed to have subsided on
               the left arm and hip, but the right wrist was still bleeding
               slightly. Medics prepped her and placed her on the gurney. Ofc.
               Petlovany rode in the ambulance with her to PRH and I followed.
               Before leaving the room, I observed a broken disposable razor
               on the counter of the dresser. It appeared some of the razors
               had been removed from it, but I did not see them anywhere. Sgt.
               Jacobson and Sgt. Griffin remained on scene and contacted hall
               staff, and WSU Counseling Services to have a counselor respond
               to assist with the friend, Mattie who had found Shelby. Housing
               trouble shooter was also called to the scene to assist with
               clean up of the blood. At the hospital, I signed a Release of
               Adult Protective Custody form which was also signed by Dr.
               Clark. I explained what I knew and saw. I then cleared. I
               returned to the station and changed clothing as my jumpsuit was

               if anything else needed to be done. I was advised everything
               had been handled and I cleared. My video was later downloaded

               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               09/13/14 at about 0354 hrs Dispatch toned out a fire alarm at
               Wilmer/Davis Hall. I responded and found on the alarm panel
               that the alarm was triggered by a smoke alarm activation
               outside room 85. I went to that area of the building and before
               I reached the location could see smoke in the nearby hallway. I
               stopped at that location and directed Pullman Fire units in.
               Pullman Fire knocked down a fire that was burning in a plastic
               laundry tub in a laundry room at the back of the Hillside Cafe.
               The cause of the fire was unknown. The WSU Fire Marshall was
               contacted and responded due to the unknown ignition source for
               the fire. There were no forced entry points to indicate someone
               broke into the building and started the fire intentionally. A
               list of employees who worked the night before was obtained and
               turned over to Officer Jones. Officer Jones will be continuing
               the investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of
