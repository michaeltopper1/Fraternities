               0916 hrs I was dispatched to a report of a traffic hazard at
               Stadium Way and Nevada Street. I contacted the complainant,
               Dale A. Tronsen (DOB 11-14-1956), in the police department
               lobby. Tronsen is employed by Pullman Transit. Tronsen
               explained that he has examined the cycling of the traffic
               lights at the intersection of Stadium Way and Nevada Street.
               Tronsen stated that he believes the lights are not functioning
               properly and are causing confusion among bus drivers and other
               motorists. Tronsen provided me with some suggestions on how the
               situation could be improved. I told Tronsen that I would
               provide his suggestions to the WSU Life Safety division, which
               is responsible for programming the traffic lights on campus. I
               later contacted Ryan Gehring, with WSU Life Safety, on the
               telephone. I provided Gehring with Tronsen's suggestions and
               contact information. Gehring said he would re-evaluate the
               operation of the traffic lights at that intersection and would
               contact Tronsen if he needed more information. No further

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W3275 SYNOPSIS: Edurne Beltran De Heredia
               Carmona (DOB 02-04-1991) was involved in a verbal domestic
               dispute with her ex-boyfriend, Alan M. Ahmad (DOB 10-20-1984).
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 09-05-
               2014 at about 1037 hrs I was dispatched to a report of a
               domestic dispute that had occurred earlier this same day in
               Thompson Hall, located at 505 NE Veterans Way. I arrived on
               scene and contacted the complainant, Edurne Beltran De Heredia
               Carmona (DOB 02-04-1991). Edurne is from Spain and is attending
               Washington State University (WSU) as a graduate student and is
               working as a Spanish teaching assistant within the Department
               of Foreign Languages. Her office is located at Thompson Hall
               #205. Edurne explained that she had been involved in a dating
               relationship with an individual identified as Alan M. Ahmad
               (DOB 10-20-1984) and referred to him as her ex-boyfriend.
               Edurne told me that Ahmad resides in Wales in the United
               Kingdom, and they dated when she lived in Spain. Edurne said
               that she moved to Pullman, Washington in August 2014, and Ahmad
               remained in the United Kingdom. Sometime around the last week
               in August and after arriving in Pullman, Edurne said that she
               broke up with Ahmad during a Skype conversation. Edurne said
               that she made it clear to Ahmad that their relationship had
               ended, and she wanted no further contact from him. Edurne said
               she blocked Ahmad from all her online accounts and obtained a
               new cellular telephone number so he would not be able to
               contact her. Edurne told me that she heard rumors over the past
               few weeks from family and friends that Ahmad might have been
               planning to come to Pullman. Edurne said she did not want to
               see Ahmad and did not wish to have any contact from him. Edurne
               said she never encouraged Ahmad to visit her in Pullman. Edurne
               said on 09-05-2014 at about 1000 hrs she was on the second
               floor of Thompson Hall and was approaching her office, room
               #205. Edurne said that Ahmad was standing in the hallway
               outside her office door. Ahmad was crying and asked Edurne to
               please forgive him. Ahmad told Edurne that he had been walking
               around campus and had obtained a visa to stay for three months.
               Edurne said she told Ahmad "no" and told him to "go". Ahmad
               attempted to grab Edurne's arm and asked her to listen to him,
               but she pulled away. Edurne told Ahmad that she had a meeting
               and walked away. As she walked away, she heard Ahmad say that
               he would wait for her. Edurne said she was not assaulted or
               touched by Ahmad and explained that the incident was verbal
               only. Edurne said the only time physical contact almost

               occurred was when Ahmad reached for her arm, and she pulled
               away. While I was speaking with Edurne, I observed that she
               appeared to be visibly upset about the situation. Edurne was
               breathing quickly and had been crying. Edurne described Ahmad
               as: middle eastern male; 30 years old; 5-10; 160 lbs.; dark
               brown hair; purple t-shirt, jeans. Edurne stated that Ahmad is
               an accounting student. Ahmad has never been suicidal and does
               not abuse drugs or alcohol. Edurne stated that Ahmad has a
               quick temper and is the "jealous type". Edurne told me about a
               past incident where Ahmad had physically attacked another male,
               who he thought was following Edurne. Edurne stated that Ahmad
               has never been violent towards her. Edurne provided me with
               copies of two photographs of Ahmad. The photographs have been
               downloaded into Spillman. Edurne does not have any idea where
               Ahmad might be staying in Pullman. Officer Jones and I searched
               the interior of Thompson Hall and the area around the outside
               of the building, but we did not locate Ahmad. Edurne made
               arrangements for another graduate student to teach her classes
               for the remainder of the day. Photographs of Ahmad were
               distributed to Edurne's coworkers, and they were instructed to
               call 911 if he was observed in the building again. Edurne said
               she wanted the contact from Ahmad to stop. I suggested that
               Edurne obtain a court order prohibiting contact from Ahmad and
               explained the process for applying for court orders at district
               court. I explained to Edurne that the process could become more
               complicated if Ahmad left the country. I explained to Edurne
               that I planned to contact Ahmad and would officially advise him
               to have no further contact with her and would also trespass him
               from Thompson Hall. I explained to Edurne that if Ahmad
               continued to contact her, he could be arrested for stalking
               and/or criminal trespass. I also told Edurne to be aware of her
               surroundings and to take normal safety precautions. I
               transported Edurne to her residence at the Steptoe Apartments.
               Edurne assured me that Ahmad would not be able to determine the
               address for her residence, and Edurne stated that she lived
               with a roommate. I waited for Edurne to check inside her
               apartment before I left. Edurne advised that the apartment was
               safe, and I cleared the scene. At about 1537 hrs I received an
               email message from Edurne. Edurne had forwarded an email
               message to me that she had received from Ahmad on 09-05-2014 at
               1128 hrs. The email message was sent to Edurne's work email
               address at, e.beltrandeherediac@email.wsu.edu. The email
               originated from "Alan Hassan" at alan.2kan@hotmail.co.uk.
               Edurne speculated that Ahmad must have learned of her work
               email address after arriving in Pullman. I reviewed the email
               message that Edurne had received. In the message, Ahmad
               apologized for things that happened in their relationship.
               Ahmad mentioned that he had visited Edurne at her office. Ahmad
               stated that he obtained a three month visa and found a place to
               stay in Pullman. Ahmad said he came to Pullman to surprise her.
               Ahmad stated that he loves Edurne and came to Pullman to be
               close to her. Ahmad wrote that if this causes him to die or go
               to prison, he will do it. Ahmad asked for Edurne to calm down
               and try to talk to him and wrote that he believes they have a
               love story that should be filmed. A copy of the email message

               has been scanned and downloaded into Spillman. I told Edurne
               that she should not respond to any communication from Ahmad. I
               requested that she forward any additional email messages from
               Ahmad to me. I sent a reply email message to the address,
               alan.2kan@hotmail.co.uk. I identified myself as a police
               officer and requested that Ahmad contact me immediately. I also
               advised Ahmad to have no further contact with Edurne via email
               or any other method. I have not received a response from Ahmad.
               Investigation continues. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W3278 09/05/14 SYNOPSIS: Medical call at
               Fine Arts 7086 for a male thought to be in seizure. Male
               patient was transported to Pullman Regional by ambulance.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               September 5, 2014 at about 1152 hours Pullman Fire and WSU
               Police were dispatched to a reported seizure at Fine Arts room
               7086. I was the first emergency responder to arrive on scene. I
               arrived to a computer lab classroom. There were two (2) females
               in the room standing next to the male patient, later identified
               as FAIR, Brandon J. (05/31/90). Fair was sitting in a chair at
               the wall length desk. He was slumped down in his chair. His
               eyes were closed and he was rubbing his hands together. His
               hands were balled up in fist like posture. He was specifically
               rubbing his thumbs together at the joint. His forearms were
               shaking like a person would do if they were in a seizure. I
               approached Fair from behind on his left side. I had spoken to
               the females as I walked in. I gently put my right hand on his
               shoulder and began to say "Are you all right." When all of the
               sudden he burst out of his chair, raging mad. Fair jumped up
               into the air. His hands and arms were outstretched. Fair yelled
               "Don't touch me" in a loud aggressive manner. His arms flailed
               through the air as he fell backwards onto the concrete floor.
               His head may have hit the floor upon landing. Fair wrapped his
               arms up in the electrical cords of the desk next to him. He
               also became entangled in a utility cart that was near his head.
               Fair was crying and hyperventilating. He would not respond to
               verbal commands or cues. I requested an additional officer as
               he became aggressively combative within a blink of an eye. Sgt.
               Macy and Pullman Police Officer Emerson responded to the scene.
               Pullman Fire personnel arrived on scene and were briefed. The
               instructor had told me that Fair appeared to be sleeping
               throughout the hour long class. She said there were
               presentations happening. It wasn't until class was over when
               she realized there was a problem and called 911. The instructor
               thought Fair was exhibiting the signs of a seizure. Pullman
               Fire personnel and police personnel worked to get Fair
               untangled from the cords and utility cart. Pullman Fire Medics
               administered a nasal medication to Fair. This calmed Fair down,
               relaxing him so we could extricate him from the cords and
               utility cart. Fair was transported by ambulance to Pullman
               Regional Hospital. I followed the ambulance to the hospital per
               their request as a precaution. Upon arrival at the hospital
               Fair was conscious, alert and oriented. He spoke about a

               question concerning a letter he received from Student Conduct.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 9/5/14
               at about 1300 hours I contacted a Jordan Christopher Trujillo,
               9/11/93, in the front lobby of the WSU PD. Jordan showed me a
               letter he had received from Student Standards. The letter
               stated Jordan needed to meet with them concerning a MIP he had
               received on 8/30/14. Jordan said he contacted Student Standards
               (Kim Barrett), and told her that there must be a mistake
               because he had not been arrested for MIP. Barrett told Jordan
               if that was the case he would need to contact the WSU Police to
               see who used his name when being arrested for MIP. Checking the
               system it was learned a Trujillo, Jordan C. was arrested for
               MIP on 8/30/14 by Officer Westerman. Further investigation
               showed Officer Westerman arrested a Jordan "Cole" Trujillo
               (11/13/94) not Jordan "Christopher" Trujillo (09/11/93). I
               contacted Kim Barrett of Student Standards and informed her of
               the situation. Barrett said told me to tell Jordan he could
               disregard the letter received from Student Standards and he
               would receive another letter in a couple of days clearing his
               name from this situation and apologizing for the mix up. No
               further at this time. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this ____ day of

               Hall. She said the noise generated from man on the mall was
               making it difficult for her to grade papers. The unidentified

               NARRATIVE: On 09/05/14 at about 1634 hrs Dispatch advised of a
               report there was a male at 205 Thompson Hall who had been
               involved in a domestic dispute with his ex-girlfriend at that
               location earlier in the day. Corporal Daniels and I responded.
               I contacted the reporting party, Dori N. Reddick(092277), who
               told me she was in room 205 Thompson Hall, which is a shared
               office. A male arrived and gave her a bag with some clothing in
               it and asked her to give it to Edurne. Reddick said she
               recognized the male from a photograph she was shown of Edurne
               Beltran De Heredia Carmona's ex-boyfriend, who showed up at the
               office earlier. She was told if he showed up again to call the
               police. Reddick provided me with a small plastic bag containing
               several items of women's clothing. The male, Alan AM. Ahmad
               (102094), was already gone from the building upon our arrival.
               As we were leaving Corporal Daniels located Ahmad walking near
               the bus stop on Thatuna Rd. near the Old Bookie building. She
               contacted the male and made it clear to him that Edurne did not
               wish to have any contact with him at all through any means. She
               told him if he showed up at her office, or tried to contact her
               in any way, he would be subject to arrest for
               stalking/harassment. Ahmad said he understood. Ahmad stated he
               was staying in Pullman for the rest of the month, and was
               currently staying at Nendels. He said he was going to call
               Edurne's family as they were friends and liked him. She advised
               to not contact the family. He also stated he wanted Edurne to
               pay for his plane ticket as she had been the one to tell him to
               come to Pullman. He was advised Edurne was under no obligation
               to pay him for the ticket as it was his decision to come to
               Pullman. He again was told not to contact Edurne. Corporal
               Daniels took the bag with the clothing in it to Edurne and
               advised her we contacted Ahmad on campus and made clear to him
               she did not wish to speak with him. She also provided her with
               a ATVP Card and explained to her the process for getting a
               restraining order. Edurne stated Ahmad had sent an email
               earlier stating he was going to be in Pullman for three months
               and had made a friend who was going to let him stay with him.

               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Spencer M. MacKenzie
               warned Poss Marijuana < 40 grams 2. NARRATIVE: On 09-05-14 at
               approximately 1648 hours, I responded to Rogers Hall for the
               report of a subject with marijuana in his room. I contacted the
               RP, RED McClure, who stated one of the residents stated their
               roommate had marijuana in the room. The roommate was concerned
               about having illegal substances in the room and wanted us to
               contact Spencer MacKenzie, who had the marijuana. He stated he
               was currently in the room. I went to room 823 and knocked on
               the door. I could see through the peep hole someone look out
               and then go back into the room like they were hiding something.
               I waited and after about thirty seconds, a male, later
               identified as Spencer, opened the door. I told him I was there
               because I knew he had marijuana in the room. Spencer was very
               nervous and at first denied having any. I told him to collect
               what he had in the room and we would dispose of it. He sat down
               at the desk and looked up at the bookshelf. I then saw him look
               down at a back pack. He got up and pulled a jar out from under
               some covers on the bed. The jar had about a gram and half of
               marijuana in it and a bong stem. He told me it was all he had.
               I asked him if he would give me permission to enter his room
               and look around and he said yes. I again asked if there was any
               more in the room and he said no. He continued to be very
               nervous. I asked what was in the back pack and he said nothing.
               I could see in the trash, reminisce of a swisher sweet which I
               know from training and experience to be used for blunts. He
               admitted he had rolled a blunt earlier and smoked it. I asked
               if he smoked it in the room and he said no. I asked him where
               the blunt was and he said he only had swisher sweets left and
               opened the small pocket on the back pack to show me. I then
               looked in the larger pocket of the back pack and found another
               jar with marijuana. It had about three grams of marijuana in
               it. He stated that was a friends and he was just holding it for
               him. I advised him I would sending his information to Student
               Conduct and he said he understood. I asked what he had been
               using to smoke it and he pulled a glass pipe off the shelf he
               had been looking at earlier. I escorted him outside and had him
               dispose of the items in the dumpster. I asked him if he had any
               questions and he said no. I cleared. I later was called back as
               the roommate was again reporting marijuana in the room. After
               speaking to him and hall staff, it was determined the second

               09/05/14 at about 2340 hrs I was driving eastbound on Cougar
               Way near Regents Hall when I noticed a male, later identified
               as Alexander R. Gunter (100995), who was walking eastbound
               along Cougar Way. Gunter caught my attention because he
               appeared to be under the age of 21 and was having difficulty
               walking, staggering side to side. I contacted Gunter as he
               entered the parking lot at Regents Hall. I asked Gunter where
               he was going and he said Regents Hall. I asked how much he had
               to drink and he admitted to having consumed several beers. As I
               spoke to Gunter I could smell the odor of intoxicants on his
               breath. I noticed he spoke with slurred speech and swayed side
               to side as he stood. I asked Gunter how old he was and he said
               18. I asked if he had is ID with him and he provided me with
               his WSU ID and date of birth, which I confirmed through
               Dispatch. I asked Gunter if I could check his eyes to see how
               much alcohol he had to drink. He agreed and I attempted to
               administer a horizontal gaze nystagmus test on him. Gunter kept
               moving his head side to side during the test and was not able
               to keep his head still. I asked Gunter if he would provide a
               breath sample so I could see how much alcohol was in his
               system. He agreed and provided a sample of .220 on alco sensor
               FST #5493. I told Gunter I would be forwarding charges for MIP
               Exhibiting to the Whitman County Prosecutor's office. I asked
               him if he could call a friend to come get him because he was so
               highly intoxicated I did not want to let him walk off alone. He
               contacted his friend, Amica V. Smith (092195), who met us
               outside Regents Hall. She said she would stay with Gunter and
               make sure he was ok. Nothing further. I certify and declare

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W3297 SYNOPSIS: Report of a fight outside
               Northside Hall. An injured subject was located near Streit Hall
               and transported to the hospital for a laceration to the head.
               No suspects at this time. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR#
               1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 09/06/14 at about 0105 hrs Dispatch toned
               out a fight in progress between Northside Hall and Streit Hall.
               I responded and upon my arrival saw a group of people standing
               near the southwest entrance to Streit Hall. As I approached I
               could see a male laying on his back on the concrete near the
               entrance to Streit. The male, later identified as Dylan T.
               Abrams (012095), had an abrasion on his left cheek near the
               corner of his eye and an approximately four inch laceration on
               his forehead above his left eye. He had blood around his mouth,
               presumably from biting his tongue. Abrams was unconscious
               initially but began to regain consciousness shortly after my
               arrival. I directed him not to move around while I requested
               Dispatch send medical personnel. I directed WSU Police Intern
               Drumheller to identify a group of witnesses in the area while I
               gave first aid to Abrams. As I was doing that I spoke with a
               female who was with Abrams, later identified as Katherine E.
               Mackie (020696). Mackie said Abrams had been walking her home
               from the Greek Row area. As they walked past Northside Hall
               several males started yelling at Abrams from inside Northside
               Hall. She thought they were on the 2nd floor. She did not know
               what they were yelling about. She told Abrams to keep walking
               and as they got closer to Streit Hall and were going up the
               stairs several males ran up and one of them pushed Abrams in
               the back, knocking him to the ground. The suspects then ran off
               in the direction of Colorado St. Mackie thought they were
               probably the same people who had been yelling at them from
               inside Northside Hall. She described them as one white male and
               two darker skinned males. I asked Abrams if he knew what
               happened or remembered anything. He said he did not remember
               anything about what happened. As I spoke to Abrams I could
               smell a strong odor of intoxicants and noticed he appeared to
               be quite intoxicated. Pullman Ambulance Personnel arrived and
               transported Abrams to PRH for treatment. I spoke with the group
               of witnesses who were there, later identified as Chandler Tran
               (102495), Zachary D. Seibel (100595), Logan R. Stoick (050696),
               and Theron T. Westby (041396). They told me they were walking
               westbound on Colorado St. when they saw and heard what they
               believed to be a fight near the entrance to Streit Hall. They
               went to see if anyone needed help and as they were going up the

               stairs three males were leaving. They asked the males what was
               going on. One said nothing while another said don't mess with
               ____ and said a fraternity name which no one could remember.
               Tran, Seibel, Stoick, and Westby continued up the stairs and
               found Abrams laying on the ground face down. They rolled him
               over to check on him and he was unconscious. Tran, Seibel,
               Stoick, and Westby descirbed the males as one latino male with
               a goatee wearing a cougar shirt, one white male with longer
               shaggy hair wearing a plaid shirt that was open down the front,
               and one black male wearing no shirt who was very muscular. They
               believed the white male was the one who pushed Abrams and
               thought he went inside Northside Hall. I contacted Charles A.
               Beckers (071786) the reporting party. He told me he was inside
               Northside Hall and heard yelling. He saw the group of males
               exit Northside Hall and get in a verbal altercation with
               another male, likely Abrams. There was a female with her hand
               over Abrams' mouth who was trying to calm the situation. As the
               female and Abrams walked away one of the males from inside
               Northside Hall, described as the "white one", pushed Abrams in
               the back. All of the suspects then left the area. Beckers did
               not know any of the suspects. I walked through the 2nd floor of
               Northside Hall. I did not see anyone matching the suspect
               descriptions given. I went to the hospital and spoke with
               Mackie again about the argument that occurred outside Northside
               Hall. She told me she had her hand over Abram's mouth trying to
               get him to stop and just keep walking. She said she did not
               realize the suspects were outside of the hall at that point.
               She did not think she would be able to identify the suspects if
               she saw them again. I asked Abrams if he could remember
               anything. He did not remember anything. The last thing he could
               remember was being at his fraternity house, Delta Tau Delta. I
               provided Abrams with my business card and the case number. I
               asked him to call me if he was able to remember anything else
               later. At this time I have no suspects and no further leads.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 06 day of September, 2014, in

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W3298 SYNOPSIS: Subject backed into a
               parked patrol vehicle near Northside Hall. Pullman PD responded
               and subject was arrested for DUI. See PPD Case #14-P07758.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 09-06-
               14 at approximately 0112 hours, I had responded to a Citizen
               Dispute at Streit Hall near Northside Hall. I had parked my
               patrol vehicle (#38) on Colorado street just passed the
               entrance to the driveway leading between Streit Hall and
               Northside Hall. My vehicle was on the north side of the roadway
               facing east. The vehicle was running with the headlights on. I
               had walked up the driveway to start having two vehicles, which
               were stopped behind Ofc. Boyd's patrol vehicle parked in the
               driveway, back out as an ambulance was responding for a subject
               who had a severe head injury. The first vehicle began to back
               out and as I approached the second vehicle, I heard a crash. I
               looked back and saw the first vehicle had backed out of the
               driveway, around the curb, and collided with my patrol vehicle.
               I asked Whitcom to dispatch a Pullman Officer to my location
               due to the accident. The vehicle pulled onto Colorado and
               pulled up on front of Northside Hall. I approached the driver
               and advised I was recording, and I activated my Axon camera. I
               advised him I would need his driver's license, registration,
               and proof of insurance. The male began getting his driver's
               license out, and I observed his movements were very slow and
               deliberate. I also observed he had very bloodshot, watery eyes,
               that appeared sleepy. He was identified as Garrett D. Gerling
               by his WA Driver's License. He provided the registration and
               when I asked for his insurance, he handed me his medical
               insurance card. I asked him for his vehicle insurance card and
               he handed me an expired insurance card. He later advised me he
               only had the one insurance card. I advised him a Pullman
               Officer was in route to speak with him and deal with the
               accident. He stated he understood. I told him to remain in the
               vehicle. A short time later, Pullman Ofc. Cornish arrived. I
               advised him I observed the driver had very slow and deliberate
               movements. I also advised him the information I had obtained
               were on the trunk of the vehicle. I then returned to help the
               medics with the injured subject from the other call. When my
               assistance was no longer needed, I returned and observed
               Cornish was administering SFTS to Gerling. Gerling was placed
               into custody for DUI. Ofc. Myklebust arrived and I provided him
               with the registration for the patrol car. I also advised him my
               Intern rider and the two Cougar Security Ofc's had witnessed

               Dispatch advised of a request for a welfare check on a subject
               who was supposed to be in room 279 Northside Hall. The subject,
               Joseph S. Smith (082195), was reported to be intoxicated and
               have hit his head fairly hard earlier in the night. His friends
               were trying to make contact with him to check on him but he was
               not answering his door or the phone. I responded and as I was
               walking with hall staff to the room hall staff recognized a
               male in the hallway as being Smith's roommate. They asked him
               if Smith was in their room and he said no. He opened the door
               to room 279 so we could check. I found Smith sleeping on his
               bed under a blanket. I woke Smith and confirmed he was ok and
               not in need of any medical attention. Nothing further. I

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W3300 SYNOPSIS: Report of an unconscious
               female in a room at Northside Hall. Subject was evaluated by
               medics and determined to not need transport. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 09-06-14 at
               approximately 0151 hours, I responded to Northside Residence
               Hall for the report of a female being carried into a room. The
               hall staff had attempted to contact the female to see if she
               needed medical attention and had the door shut in their face.
               They stated the residents were refusing to open the door. I
               arrived and knocked and announced at the door. The door was
               opened and the occupants invited me in to check on the female.
               She was identified as Emily K. Olson by her WA Driver's
               License. Emily was unconscious on the bed on her side. I was
               able to wake her after a about a minute and began asking her
               questions. When I asked her what day of the week it was she
               stated Wednesday. She was able to answer my other questions. I
               observed she was very intoxicated and had the odor of
               intoxicants emitting from her breath. She also had very slurred
               speech. I asked her to take a PBT test and a reading of .242
               was observed. Medics arrived and evaluated her. They stated she
               would be fine if left with a sober friend. Her roommate,
               Katherine M. Spencer, stated she would stay with her. I advised
               them to call if she got worse. Hall staff stated they would
               take care of the subjects who had closed the door and refused
               to answer as they had left the room prior to my arrival. Those
               who were in the room when I arrived were cooperative. I
               cleared. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 6th day of September, 2014, in Pullman,
