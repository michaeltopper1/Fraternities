               about 0906 hours I was dispatched to a report of a stolen cell
               phone from Sloan Hall. I called the complainant/victim, Sara C.
               Humphreys (12/13/84). She told me that she went to a computer
               lab in Sloan 327 yesterday, September 17, 2014 between 1800 and
               2100 hours. She realized last night that her phone was missing.
               Humphreys checked the computer lab but could not find her
               phone. Humphreys said her phone was ringing last night when she
               called it. It was not ringing today as she believes the battery
               is dead. Humphreys is unsure if the phone was lost or stolen.
               She has checked with various offices in Sloan but has not
               located the cell phone. The phone is described as: MAKE:

               LOCKED: Not locked - unlocked PHONE #: 509-339-5580 According
               to Humphreys the phone has been connected to the WSU wireless
               network. I will submit the information to WSU IT for tracking
               purposes. There are no suspects, witnesses, or leads at this

               approximately 1814 hours, I was at the Yellow Lot south of
               Beasley Coliseum when I observed a motor home enter the parking
               lot at a speed which seemed to more than appropriate due to the
               congestion with motor homes being parked for the WSU home
               football game. The motor home continued into the lot and out of
               my view. About five seconds, I heard a loud crash. I walked to
               the area and found the motor home I had seen pull in, had
               struck a parked motor home. I began taking photographs of the
               damage to the parked motor home. As I got to the motor home
               which caused the damage, I observed it was stopped a few feet
               from the other motor home. I took photographs of the damage to
               this motor home as well. I asked a male who was leaning in a
               window of a truck if he was the driver of the motor home which
               caused the damage and he said yes. I observed he had just put a
               cinnamon candy in his mouth. I asked him what happened, and he
               said he wasn't sure. I observed he had the odor of intoxicants
               emitting from his breath as he spoke. I activated my Axon
               camera and asked him if he had any identification and he said
               yes. He seemed to have slow deliberate movements as he
               attempted to remove his license. As it came out of the pocket
               of the wallet, he made the comment that it is hard to remove. I
               observed while standing next to him, that he was swaying in a
               circular motion approximately 6 inches in each direction. He
               was identified as Todd K. Bollman (w/m/06-20-59) by his WA
               Driver's License. I asked Todd how much he had to drink tonight
               and he told me he had four beers earlier. Todd stated he wanted
               to be honest and admit he had been drinking and was not sure
               why he had struck the other motor home. Whitcom advised me the
               motor home registration was expired. I asked Todd if he had
               registration and proof of insurance and he said he didn't know.
               He told me the motor home is for his company, Odom and he
               didn't know if those documents were in the vehicle. I asked him
               if he had someone sober who could move the motor home out of
               the way as it was in the middle of the parking area. He stated
               he would find someone. When Todd returned I asked him to get
               rid of the candy in his mouth and he did. After waiting about
               five minutes, I asked him if he would be willing to perform
               some field sobriety tests and he said yes. I asked him if he
               was willing to take a PBT test which was voluntary and did not

               replace the evidentiary breath test. He said he wasn't sure and
               asked me to tell him what to do. I advised him I could not give
               him advice and the question I asked was a yes or no answer. He
               thought about it and decided he did not what to take the test.
               I asked him if he was willing to do other voluntary tests and
               he said yes. The first test I asked him to do was the HGN. I
               had him stand with his feet together and his arms down at his
               sides. I advised him to follow the tip of my finger with his
               eyes only without moving his head. He said he understood. As I
               administered the test, I could see he was unable to follow the
               instructions as he was swaying badly, and would begin to watch
               my finger and then would look passed it. Due to this I stopped
               the test. I advised Todd based on the accident and what I had
               observed, I would be arresting him for Negligent 1st Degree. He
               stated he understood. I told him I would issue him a citation
               for the incident. I turned off my recorder at this point and
               returned to my patrol vehicle to fill out the citation. While I
               was completing the citation, I asked Ofc. Kirshner to have them
               provide the trip permit for the motor home as the vehicle
               registration showed it expired in 2007. They provided it and a
               photograph of the permit was taken. I later looked at the
               permit and saw it was for September 19th-21st. I later talked
               with Todd about this and he stated the motor home was the
               companies and he didn't realize the permit was for tomorrow and
               not today. I issued him a verbal warning for the trip permit. I
               returned with the citation and activated my camera again. I
               explained to Todd his copy of the citation which I issued to
               him. I was still waiting for the insurance card to be brought
               to the scene, but needed to clear. I advised them I would
               return later to look at it. Prior to Ofc. Kirshner leaving the
               scene, they were able to produce the insurance card which he
               also photographed. Ofc. Kirshner had identified the owner of
               the RV which hit as Mark Hall. He and his wife stated they
               would handle the accident with Todd as they all knew each
               other. They stated they did not need any further assistance or
               information from us. I later downloaded the photographs to
               files and the video to S: drive. We both cleared. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               hours, I was dispatched to a report of the odor of marijuana
               coming from room 177 Regents Hall. Upon arrival, Cpl. Daniels
               and I were walking down the ramp toward room 177 and four
               females were walking towards us. At the bottom of the ramp, I
               noticed a hall staff member pointing to the four females. I
               contacted the females and told them that I needed to talk to
               them. They stopped and I explained that we were there for the
               odor of marijuana coming from room 177 Regents Hall. I asked
               who lives in room 177 and Megan Patnode raised her hand and
               told me she lives there. The four females who were later
               identified as Patnode, Taylor Roberts, Haley Ziegler, and
               Kaitlyn Zemp. I asked them who was smoking marijuana and they
               told me that none of them were smoking marijuana. I explained
               to them that there was two ways that we could deal with the
               situation. I explained that they could go retrieve their
               marijuana in the room, destroy it and I would forward their
               names to student conduct. The other option was that I could
               walk to the room and see if I could smell marijuana. If I
               could, I would apply for a search warrant which may or may not
               be granted. They looked at each other and then decided to
               destroy their marijuana. Roberts told me that she was the only
               one that had it and that they thought about smoking, but
               decided not to. I asked Roberts if she was a medical marijuana
               patient and she told me that she wasn't. I asked if any of the
               other three were and they all told me they weren't. I escorted
               the four back to room 177 and Roberts went in and retrieved a
               jar with marijuana in it. I escorted Roberts outside where she
               ground it into the dirt. I thanked Roberts for her cooperation.
               She stated that she just came over to hang out with her
               "little's." I told her that she should be a positive role model
               for her "little's" and she shouldn't be involving them in drugs
               here at WSU. She told me she understood and I told her she was
