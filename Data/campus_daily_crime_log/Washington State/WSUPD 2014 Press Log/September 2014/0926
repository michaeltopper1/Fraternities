               the library. I confirmed that Giles was a library employee and
               was authorized to be in the building. Giles stated that they
               had some construction workers in the building, and they had
               accidentally activated the alarm. After speaking with Giles, it
               was determined that the alarm was caused by employee error. I
               cleared the scene. No further action at this time. Olmstead/339

               SYNOPSIS: Legally parked motorcycle hit in WSU Student

               Unknown VEHICLE 1: Unknown INSURANCE: Unknown DAMAGE: Unknown

               Front wheel and fender bent out of alignment. Damage estimated
               at $250.00 WITNESS(ES): None NARRATIVE: On September 26, 2014
               at about 1533 hours I was dispatched to a hit and run collision
               in the WSU Student Recreation Center (SRC) Parking Lot. I
               responded to the area and contacted the complainant Wesley A.
               Wiles (05/20/91). Wiles told me he parked his motorcycle in the
               SRC parking lot and went inside to use the facility. When he
               returned to the motorcycle he discovered the front fender and
               wheel were damaged. Wiles attempted to ride the motorcycle but
               stopped because the front wheel had a bad wobble to it. I
               viewed motorcycle near the parking lot exit. This was not where
               it was originally parked. The front fender was obviously bent.
               I could not visually see damage to the spoked motorcycle wheel.
               The motorcycle was photographed. Wiles walked me back up to the
               area where he was parked. There were vehicles parked in his
               parking space as well as the space to west. He said neither of
               the vehicles parked there were involved in the collision. He
               did not have a license plate of the vehicle parked near him
               when he went into the SRC. No note was left on the motorcycle.
               It is unknown if the driver of the other vehicle even knew they
               struck the motorcycle. The offending vehicle and driver remain
               unknown. There are no witnesses, suspects or leads at this
               time. No further investigation. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 27th day of

               contact ex-boyfriend Rayne Lemaster. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 092614 at approximately 1900
               hours I was dispatched to a Threatening call that was held
               until the RP would be available. I responded to McCroskey Hall
               and met with Minji E. Lye (020795). She reported that Rayne
               Lemaster (101094) had sent text messages that she was concerned
               about. Lemaster and Lye had dated for approximately 1.5 years
               until February of 2014. She recently saw him and later called
               him to inform him that she was not interested in being anything
               other than friends. This occurred on 092514. On 091425 the
               following exchange took place via text message. The screenshots
               are attached to the case. The messaging took place between 2345
               hours and Lemaster: Goodnight Minji be careful pullman is scary
               ;) Lye: What? Lemaster: Just be careful, make the wrong moves
               and pullman will get you. ;) Lye: What does that even mean?
               Lemaster: Lol I'm saying pullman is scary and you should watch
               your back. You never know what Pullman will do to you.
               Especially when you mess with Pullmans "friends" it gets messy
               Literally I hope the world fucks you in the ass like Bradley
               wallace did. I fucking hate you and I wish I never met you. You
               are the scum of the earth and brad wallace even knows it so
               fuck you. Lemaster: Goodbye please delete everything Lye says
               that Lemaster lives in The Grove in possibly the I building and
               possibly apartment 333. However, she says he spends most of his
               time at the "Mafia" house. I later spoke to Ofc. Emerson of PPD
               and says this house is located on the 600 block of NE Garfield
               St. I asked if she was concerned about what Lemaster wrote and
               she said he was "lazy violent" and explained that he would not
               seek out an opportunity but if it arose he may do something.
               She said he usually punches walls. I asked who Bradley Wallace
               was and she said that he was an EWU football player she went to
               visit a few weeks ago. She then described how she had drank and
               "one thing led to another" and she regretted what happened with
               Wallace. I explicitly clarified with her that a sexual assault
               did not occur with Wallace. She said "no". I asked Lye what she
               would like me to do and told her our options. She stated she
               would like me to contact Lemaster and inform him she does not
               want any contact with him. I explained to her that if she had
               any contact with him she was only to state she did not want any
               further contact with him and stop at that. Lye was provided
               with the Domestic Violence information and my business card. I

               asked if she would like an advocate to respond. She stated she
               had some quizzes to take, so I directed her to the phone
               numbers for future use. Lye is an RA in Honors Hall and her
               RED, TJ Martin was aware of the situatio in case she wanted to
               move halls. I cleared and attempted phone contact with
               Lemaster. WSU and Spillman records did not show a current local
               address. As stated I met with Ofc. Emerson and he was not
               familiar with Lemaster but said he had contacts at the Mafia
               house if needed. On 092714 I returned to work and called
               Lemaster 2 more times with no results. I went to the Grove
               apartments and attempted contact at apartment I 333. I got no
               response. I am going to request Cpl. Kuhrt attempt to continue
               to contact Lemaster via phone. Case pending. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of

               Northside Residence Hall. He was walking with a slow unsteady
               gait. He appeared to be under 21. I pulled into the Northside
               Residence Hall Parking lot and asked if he was okay. He said he
               was okay but he had slurred speech. I got out of my car and
               approached him. I could smell the odor of intoxicants and saw
               that he had watery eyes. As we spoke I could smell the odor of
               intoxicants on his breath. He explained he had come from
               Margaritaville and I had no idea where that was. He told me he
               had drank one beer and had no ID. I told him to give Intern
               Cody-Berry his "name as it appeared on his driver's license".
               He admitted to being 18. He informed us his name was John P.
               Stambo (071296). I checked his eyes and observed a lack of
               smooth pursuit. He would not follow my pen to maximum
               deviation. We did not get a return and reconfirmed Yingling's
               information as Stambo. I then attempted to have him provide a
               breath sample for my PBT. He claimed his asthma would not allow
               him to blow out. He would not blow at all. I then placed him
               handcuffs and detained him until we figured out his identity. I
               told him he had the right to an attorney. He then told me his
               ID was in his pocket. He then said he had given me his uncle's
               name, so I read him his Miranda rights. He understood his
               rights. He stated his uncle worked for the FBI and that was the
               name he had given. He also provided me with a Cougar Card. At
               this time I informed him he was under arrest for MIP-Exhibiting
               and False Statements. He said "you didn't ask my real birthdate
               you said my name". I responded with "Okay". He was then
               searched incident to arrest and placed in the back of my car. A
               lap belt was secured over him. He was informed he was being
               recorded. I got in the car and moved the vehicle about 20 ft
               nearer to Northside. Yingling stated he was not wearing a
               seatbelt. I told him he was. He again said he wasn't. I assured
               him he was. He eventually realized that he was. I completed
               Sector citation #4Z0461782 for MIP-Exhibiting and False
               Statements. I then drove him to Streit Hall. I explained his
               citation to him and released him with his property and the
               citation. Yingling stated he wanted to do FST's to prove he was

               Forward CGS MIP NARRATIVE: On 09/27/14 at about 2316 hrs I
               heard Cougar Security advise of two intoxicated subjects near
               Thompson Hall who appeared to be vomiting. As I was responding
               Cougar Security followed the subjects as they walked from
               Thompson Hall Northbound past McCrosky and between Community
               and Wilmer Halls. As I reached the area I could see the
               subjects, Ashley C. Roswall and Torsen J. Etscheid, both
               appeared to be under the age of 21. They were both having
               difficulty walking, stumbling side to side while using each
               other for balance. I contacted Roswall and Etscheid as they
               reached Linden Ave. I asked where they were going and Roswall
               indicated her house, Chi Omega. As I spoke to Roswall I could
               see they were both swaying side to side as they stood. Roswall
               spoke with slurred speech. I asked how much they had to drink
               and initially they denied consuming alcohol. They eventually
               admitted to having had a little bit to drink. I asked if I
               could check Roswall's eyes and she agreed. I administered a
               horizontal gaze nystagmus test on her. I observed she had
               bloodshot and watery eyes, a lack of smooth pursuit, and a
               distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation. I could
               smell the odor of intoxicants on her breath as I administered
               the test. I had to remind Roswall not to move her head during
               the test and stopped the test early because she nearly fell
               over. I asked Etscheid if I could check his eyes as well and he
               agreed. I administered a horizontal gaze nystagmus test on him.
               I observed he had bloodshot and watery eyes, a lack of smooth
               pursuit, and a distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum
               deviation. I could smell the odor of intoxicants on his breath
               as I administered the test. I asked if they had ID with them
               and they said they did not. They each provided me with their
               name's and dates of birth, which confirmed they were both under
               21. I confirmed the information provided through Dispatch. I
               asked if they had ever been warned or arrested for
               alcohol/drugs before. Etscheid admitted he was arrested for MIP
               earlier in the year at a football game. I advised them both I
               would be forwarding charges for MIP exhibiting on both of them
               to the Whitman County Prosecutor. They both appeared able to
               care for themselves so they were released. Nothing further. I

               NARRATIVE: On 092714 at approximately 0036 hours I was driving
               on Cougar Way near WSU Parking Services when I observed Alexis
               N. Cartwright (110395) assisting Karen Gutierrez Orozco
               (020396) walk. It appeared Gutierrez Orozco was intoxicated and
               under 21. I parked my vehicle behind the old Bookie and walked
               up the hill where I encountered the 2 east of Thatuna.
               Gutierrez Orozco was using the wall for support, appeared to
               have been crying, and I could smell the odor of intoxicants
               coming from the 2. I said hello and asked if they were okay. I
               asked for their identifications and they provided Cougar Cards.
               I checked Gutierrez Orozco's eyes and observed a lack of smooth
               pursuit in both eyes. She had difficulty keeping her head
               still. She kept saying she was emotional. She was aware of
               where she was and at first could not state who the President
               was. She provided a breath sample for my PBT of .230. I then
               checked Cartwright's eyes. I observed a lack of smooth pursuit
               in both eyes. She admitted to drinking wine. I could smell the
               odor of intoxicants on her breath. She provided a breath sample
               of .134 for my PBT. I told them they would be referred to
               Student Conduct. I later called Cartwright and informed her she
               would be not referred to Student Conduct as she was attempting
               to help Gutierrez Orozco. Cartwright escorted Gutierrez Orozco
               home. I cleared. Nothing follows. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 27th day of
