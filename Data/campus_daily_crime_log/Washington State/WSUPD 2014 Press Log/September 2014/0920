               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W3609 09/20/14 SYNOPSIS: Dog was lost and
               then it was found at Chinook Apartments. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On September 20, 2014 at
               about 1326 hours I received a report of a theft of a dog from
               Chinook D22. I responded to the area where I contacted the
               dog's owner/complainant Andrew A. Miceli (07/25/85). Miceli
               said he put the dog out in the grass at about 1100 hours. The
               dog was secured to a cinder block with a retractable leash.
               Miceli went back inside and showered. When he returned about 20
               minutes later the dog and leash were gone. He assumed someone
               stole the dog. The Animal Shelter was notified. Officer
               Olmstead, WSU Parking Services personnel and I searched the
               area. We did not locate the animal. At about 1202 hours I
               checked back in with the owner. The lost dog had been found in
               the area of Chinook Apartments. I met the dog, Piper, and
               petted his head and asked him what happened. The dog did not
               say a word. He looked me in the eye and then ran around with
               the energy of a puppy. I crouched down and he ran back to me.
               Piper still would not answer my questions. He did however chew
               on my hand and then licked it clean, well that is clean for a
               dog's standard. The mystery of Piper's great escape may never
               be known. Who helped? Where did Piper go? Why did Piper leave?
               All questions that only Piper knows the answers to. In the end,
               Piper was returned to his owner and all is well. Miceli later
               conceded that the dog was not stolen but had run away on his
               own free will. No further investigation. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               20th day of September, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               about 1213 hours I was dispatched to a report of a stolen
               parking permit. I called the victim/complainant, Megan K.
               Bridge (08/13/94) as requested. Bridge told me she parked her
               scooter in the paved parking lot between the K House and the
               old Bookie building on Friday, September 19, 2014 at about 1000
               hours. When she returned at about 1300 hours she discovered the
               permit was gone. Bridge said someone unscrewed her rear license
               plate and removed the permit. There was no damage to the
               scooter. Bridge already went to WSU Parking Services and
               reported the permit was gone. She said she did that yesterday.
               The permit is valued at about $72.00. According to the WSU
               Parking database the moped permit has been reported as
               lost/stolen on September 19, 2014 at about 1315 hours. The

               and determined that the room was unoccupied. The room appeared
               to be an interview room used by the psychology department, and
               the panic alarm was affixed to the table. The alarm did not
               appear to be in the depressed or activated position. We checked
               the nearby office area and determined that it was also
               unoccupied, and nothing appeared to be out of the ordinary. The
               alarm was apparently caused by alarm malfunction. Officer

               blood on her face, hands, and arms. She had what appeared to be
               superficial cuts to the hands and arms. She was not actively
               bleeding. The cuts on her hand were made across the palms. Each
               hand had a couple of cuts on them. She had cuts on her arms
               near the biceps. The cuts were straight cuts and near each
               other. All the cuts appeared to be uniform. Hernandez said she
               was on her cell phone talking to her mother. The mother said
               something about removing her from school in the next day.
               Apparently this enraged Hernandez. She threw the cell phone on
               the ground breaking the face and hard enough for the cover and
               battery to fall out. Hernandez then began throwing glass items
               around her room shattering them into small pieces. In a fit of
               rage she destroyed the room throwing her belonging around. She
               said none of the items belonged to her roommate. I asked her
               about the cuts. She said she got them lying or rolling around
               on the floor. The cuts did not appear to have been made in such
               a way. The cuts looked like they were intentionally made. There
               was blood on her table and not on the floor where she was
               sitting. Pullman Fire personnel arrived and evaluated
               Hernandez. I told her she was going to the hospital in
               protective custody. She was compliant with police and fire
               personnel. Hernandez was crying and upset. Pullman Fire
               transported her to Pullman Regional Hospital. I turned her over
               to the hospital pursuant to RCW 71.05.150 as I believe that
               Hernandez was suffering from a mental disorder and presents an
               imminent likelihood of serious harm to herself. Officers

               On 09/20/14 at about 1753 hrs I was working at the WSU vs
               Oregon football game. I was standing near the stars on Student
               Plaza when I noticed a male, later identified as Zachary A.
               Kuehner (110395), headed toward the stadium. He caught my
               attention because he appeared to be under the age of 21 and was
               having difficulty walking, staggering side to side. I contacted
               Kuehner and asked how much he had to drink. He admitted to
               having had a couple beers. I asked if I could check his eyes to
               see how much he had to drink and he agreed. I administered a
               horizontal gaze nystagmus test and observed he had bloodshot
               and watery eyes, a lack of smooth pursuit and a distinct and
               sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation. I could smell the
               odor of intoxicants on his breath as I administered the test. I
               asked if he would be willing to provide a breath sample so I
               could see how much he had to drink and he agreed. He provided a
               sample of .101 on alco-sensor FST #5493. I advised Kuehner he
               was under arrest for MIP exhibiting and advised him of his
               right to remain silent and his right to an attorney. I escorted
               Kuehner to the processing room where I read him an ejection
               notice and explained I would be forwarding charges to the
               prosecutor for MIP exhibiting. I escorted him from the stadium.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury

               approximately 1828 hours I was working at Martin Stadium for
               the WSU Football game. I was standing near Gate I, the student
               gate, when a female wearing a grey dress caught my attention.
               The female was standing in a group of approximately 8 people.
               The female, later identified as Homa Shaarbaf 08/31/94, stood
               out amongst the group because of her inability to stand without
               bumping into people. Homa was hanging onto a male that was
               later identified as her boyfriend. While Homa tried to hang
               onto her boyfriend, she stumbled from his left side to the
               front of him twice. Homa was holding onto his arm and shirt for
               balance. Homa appeared to be under the age of 21. When the
               group started walking towards me, I walked up to Homa and told
               her I needed to speak with her. I noticed Homa's eyes were
               droopy and only about half way open. Homa and her boyfriend
               stopped. I told Homa that I was talking to her because she
               appeared to be under the age of 21 and it appeared she had a
               lot to drink. I asked Homa if she had her ID with her. Homa
               provided her WSU ID card. I asked Homa how old she was and Homa
               said 20 years old. I asked Homa how much she had to drink. Homa
               said, "not that much." I asked Homa if I could look at her eyes
               and she said yes. I told Homa to follow the tip of my pen with
               her eyes only and not to move her head. As soon as I moved my
               pen Homa moved her head to follow the pen. I reminded Homa to
               keep her head still. During the HGN test I observed, equal
               tracking, lack of smooth pursuit, and distinct and sustained
               nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes. During the test
               Homa was swaying side to side. As Homa stood before me I could
               clearly smell the odor of intoxicants coming from her breath. I
               again asked Homa how much she had to drink today. Homa again
               replied, "not that much." I asked how much that was and she
               said about two shots. I asked how long ago did she take her
               shots and Homa said about and hour ago. I told Homa that I
               would not be stopping to talk to her if she only had two shots
               and asked her if she wanted to be more honest with me. Homa
               said she really only had two shots and it is because she is "a
               lightweight" when it comes to drinking. I told Homa that she
               was under arrest for MIP and handcuffed (D/L) her. I advised
               Homa of her right to counsel and walked her to the Processing
               Room. Once at the Processing Room it was determined that Homa

               I would be forwarding charges of MIP Exhibiting to the
               Prosecutor as well as referring this case to student conduct. I
               explained the process to Homa and she stated she understood. I
               walked Homa outside of Gate A and read her an ejection notice.
               Homa was released from custody and Homa and her boyfriend
               walked home. Nothing further. I certify and declare under

               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Megan M. Lee/082995 Arrest/forward chgs MIP 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 09/20/14 at about 1849 hrs I was working at the
               WSU vs Oregon football game in Martin Stadium. I was standing
               inside the outer concourse near gate I when I noticed a female
               who was entering the stadium. The female, later identified as
               Megan M. Lee (082995), caught my attention because she appeared
               to be under the age of 21 and was having difficulty walking,
               staggering side to side and holding onto another person for
               balance. I contacted Lee and asked how much alcohol she had to
               drink. She admitted to having had a couple beers. I asked if I
               could check her eyes to see and she agreed. I administered a
               horizontal gaze nystagmus test on her and observed she had
               bloodshot and watery eyes, a lack of smooth pursuit, and a
               distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation. I could
               smell the odor of intoxicants on her breath as I administered
               the test. I told Lee she was under arrest for MIP Exhibiting
               and advised her of her right to remain silent and her right to
               an attorney. I escorted Lee to the processing room where I read
               her an ejection warning and explained I would be forwarding
               charges to the prosecutor for MIP Exhibiting. I escorted her
               out of the stadium. Nothing further. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               21 day of September, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               than 40 grams, and Making False or Misleading Statements to a

               NARRATIVE: On 09/20/14 at approximately 1918 hours, Dep. Brown
               and I were working at Martin Stadium at the WSU Football game.
               I was standing near section 31 on the concourse observing the
               crowd when a male in a grey tee shirt caught my attention. The
               male, later identified as Juan Daniel Pacheco-Gaspar 06/30/96,
               was being assisted by a friend, Juan J. Quijada-Flores
               06/20/96, while walking. Gaspar was stumbling forward and
               backwards as Flores hung onto Gaspar's left arm. Flores
               appeared to be out of it and had a blank look upon his face.
               Gaspar's head was wobbling around as he walked as if Gaspar did
               not have control of his own head. Gaspar appeared to be under
               the age of 21. I walked up to the two and told Gaspar I need to
               talk with him. I escorted Gaspar over to the fence area away
               from the crowd. Gaspar still had a blank look on his face and
               had spit running down his bottom lip. It was clear that Gaspar
               was highly intoxicated. I asked Gaspar for his ID and he said
               he did not have it. I asked Gaspar several questions to
               determine his mental status. Gaspar was able to correctly
               answer my questions even though his words were heavily slurred.
               Gaspar was swaying in all directions while he stood before me.
               I again asked Gaspar about his ID. Gaspar said he did not have
               his ID. I asked how Gaspar could get into the WSU football game
               without a WSU Cougar Card. Gaspar said he did not have it. I
               asked Gaspar for his last name. Gaspar spelled his last name as
               "GASPAR". I asked Gaspar to spell his first name. Gaspar
               spelled it, "JUSEE." Gaspar said his middle name was Daniel and
               provided his date of birth as 06/29/96. I asked Gaspar if he
               had a Washington Driver's license and Gaspar replied, "no I
               don't." I asked Gaspar if he has every been issued a driver's
               license. Gaspar said, "no I don't." I asked Gaspar if he has
               ever been issued a state ID. Gaspar said no. I told Gaspar that
               I find it odd that someone would have made it to College and
               never been issued a state ID in his life. I again asked Gaspar
               what state he was through and he said "Idaho." I asked Gaspar
               what was his address on his Idaho driver's license. Gaspar
               replied, "I don't know right now." I asked Gaspar how much he
               had to drink today. Gaspar attempted to answer but I was unable

               to understand what he was saying. I asked Gaspar if I could
               check his eyes. Gaspar said I could. I told Gaspar to follow
               the tip of my pen with his eyes only and not to move his head.
               Gaspar said ok. As soon as I moved my pen, Gaspar moved his
               head to follow the pen. Gaspar kept moving his head every time
               I moved the pen. Due to this I was only able to observe, lack
               of smooth pursuit in both eyes. The whole time Gaspar was
               standing before me, he was swaying in all directions. I could
               clearly smell the strong odor of intoxicants coming from his
               breath. I told Gaspar that he was under arrest for MIP
               Exhibiting and handcuffed (D/L) him. I advised Gaspar of his
               right to counsel. I walked Gaspar to the Processing Room. While
               walking there, due to Gaspar's intoxication level I was having
               a difficult time keeping him walking straight. Flores handed
               Dep. Brown Gaspar's wallet. Once at the Processing Room I
               searched Gaspar incident to arrest. During the search I located
               a ziplock sandwich bag containing one large bud of marijuana in
               his right pocket. I read Gaspar his Miranda Rights off my
               department issued card. Gaspar stated he understood his rights.
               I asked Gaspar, having his rights in mind did he still wish to
               speak with me. Gaspar replied, "I want to speak to my lawyer."
               I searched Gaspar's property to include his wallet. I found
               Gaspar's Washington State Driver's License in his wallet.
               Gaspar's WADL identified him as "Juan Daniel Pacheco-Gaspar
               06/30/96." It was very clear that Gaspar had lied about his
               name and date of birth when he provided it verbally. Gaspar
               appeared as if he was going to throw up so I grabbed the trash
               can and placed it in front of him. I started Gaspar's
               processing when he blurted out, "an Oregon guy made me drink."
               Gaspar clearly was engaging me in conversation and I asked
               Gaspar why the Oregon guy made him drink. Gaspar said, "I don't
               know." I asked Gaspar if he knew the Oregon guy. Gaspar said it
               was his girlfriends friend. While I was talking to Gaspar he
               began to vomit into the trash can. Due to Gaspar vomiting I had
               medics respond to evaluate him. Once medics arrived they
               evaluated him and stated that Gaspar did not need medical
               attention. I told Gaspar that he was being charged with three
               crimes. MIP Exhibiting, Possession of Marijuana less than 40
               grams, and making false of misleading statements to a public
               servant. While filling out Gaspar's criminal citations, Gaspar
               continued to vomit. Gaspar was also sweating profusely. I again
               called medics to reevaluate him. Medics checked on Gaspar and
               again cleared him saying he did not need medical attention. I
               issued Gaspar criminal citations C8984 and C8985 for MIP
               Exhibiting, Possession of Marijuana less than 40 grams, and
               making false of misleading statements to a public servant. I
               explained the citations to Gaspar and provided him with his
               copies. I walked Gaspar out of Gate A and read him an ejection
               notice. I turned Gaspar over to Flores who said he would take
               care of Gaspar for the rest of the night. Once Gaspar was
               turned over to Flores, I returned to the game. Once I returned
               to the station the seized marijuana NIC tested presumptive
               positive for marijuana. The marijuana was weighted at 0.71
               grams NET. The marijuana was logged into evidence. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under

               about 1941 hours WSU Police Intern Alex Elwell was on a traffic
               detail at Stadium Way and Orchard Drive for the WSU football
               game against Oregon. Intern Elwell observed a college aged
               female staggering and then on her knees in the grass on the
               north side of Beasley Coliseum. I responded to the area. I
               observed the female walking north on the sidewalk near Orchard
               and North Fairway Lane. Her balance appeared to be off as she
               walked. When I contacted her I could smell the odor of
               intoxicants coming from her breath. Her eyes were red and
               watery. When she talked her words were slurred. The female was
               identified via her Cougar Card as ESPINOZA,Lauren A.
               (05/17/94). She admitted to consuming alcohol and being under
               the age of 21. Espinoza somehow got separated from her friends
               at the football game. Espinoza agreed to provide a voluntary
               breath sample. I gave her three (3) attempts but she was not
               able to blow through the straw adequately to provide the
               necessary sample. Espinoza was obviously intoxicated and I was
               concerned about her welfare walking by herself incapacitated by
               alcohol. After some time I was finally able to get in contact
               with Keana Miller. Miller is a friend of Espinoza. Miller said
               she would be willing to take care of Espinoza. Intern Elwell
               and I transported Espinoza to Miller's apartment on Markley
               Drive. Miller had not been drinking and was able to care for
               Espinoza. No citations, infractions or charges issued. I

               to side when he walked. His face was flushed and his eyelids
               were droopy as well. I contacted the male, later identified as
               Brandon T. Kebba, and escorted him to the processing room. As
               soon as I contacted Kebba, I could smell the odor of
               intoxicants coming from his breath and I began recording my
               contact with him. His speech was heavily slurred and his eyes
               were bloodshot and watery. I escorted Kebba to the processing
               room and asked him to sit on the bench. More to follow. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 22nd day of September, 2014, in Pullman,

               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On September 20, 2014 at
               about 2025 hours I was dispatched to an animal problem on North
               Fairway Rd and North Fairway Lane. WSU Police Interns and WSU
               Cougar Security were out with a lost dog. I responded to the
               area. The dog was found running at large. When a family opened
               up their SUV to leave the football game the dog jumped inside
               the back seat and cowered on the floor. The female golden
               retriever appeared to be scared. The dog was not aggressive.
               The dog had a WSU collar, a choke chain collar and several dog
               tags. None of the tags had the owner information on it. With
               help from the passerby's concerned about the dog we were able
               to coax it out of the back of the SUV. I put the dog in the
               back of my patrol car. I was able to contact Pullman Animal
               Control Officer Schaeffer. She used her animal chip reader to
               locate owner information. ACO Schaeffer called the owner and
               arranged to return the dog. I met the owner, Jennifer A. Lee
               (03/11/81) in front of the WSU Baseball field on North Fairway
               Lane. The dog was identified as "Kona" a six year old
               retriever. Lee said Kona is very afraid of the cannon noise at
               the football game. Kona broke down the door of her tent trailer
               and escaped. Lee was very excited and joyful to get her dog
               back. She thanked me many times for returning the dog. No
               further investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 21st day of

               BOOKED Malicious Mischief 2nd 2. NARRATIVE: REPORT NOT COMPLETE
               On 09-20-14 at approximately 2146 hours, I heard Sgt. Macy
               advising Stadium Command, they had been told by a patron at the
               WSU football game that a male was damaging cars on the first
               floor of the Fine Arts Parking Garage. I responded and as I
               pulled into the garage, I observed a male standing near a car
               and he was pulling on the door handle. As I stopped my patrol
               vehicle and began to exit, I observed him turn and begin to
               walk away quickly. I activated my Axon camera. I told him to
               stop and asked him what he was doing. He stated he was good. I
               again asked him what he was doing and he said he was hanging
               out with friends. I observed the male's speech was extremely
               slurred, and there was no one in the car he was around. I asked
               him who the vehicle belonged to and he said he didn't know. I
               asked him why he was trying to get into it then and he said he
               wasn't. I asked the male if he had identification and he said
               yes. He handed me his WA Driver's License and he was identified
               as Daniel Fitzgerald. I asked him why he was hitting cars and
               he stated he wasn't. I had Sgt. Macy looking at the vehicles in
               the area to see if there was damage to any of them. I asked
               Daniel if he had any friends at the game and he said yes. I
               asked if he could contact one to come get him and he started to
               look at his phone and then would be distracted. He kept saying
               things, but they didn't make sense. Including saying he was
               staying in Wyoming tonight with friends when I asked him where
               he was staying. At one point he said the car had "Moscow" on
               it. I noticed the rear license plate holder says "Pullman
               Moscow" on it. Daniel began to become agitated talking about
               Moscow and pronounced it like Moscow Russia and not Moscow,
               Idaho. I then noticed on the driver's side rear passenger door,
               there were several shoe prints. I also noticed the door was
               damaged. I asked Daniel if I could look at the bottom of his
               shoes and he showed me the sole of his shoe. It was a match to
               the print left on the car. I advised Daniel he was under arrest
               for Malicious Mischief and had the right to an attorney. He was
               handcuffed and the handcuffs were double locked. I had Sgt.
               Macy search him and he was placed in the rear of my patrol
               vehicle. I took photographs of the damage. I observed there was
               at least six separate shoe prints on the door. It appeared the
               door had been donkey kicked. It was very dented. I estimate the

               by Reserve Deputy Kalin. I later contacted one of the RO's of
               the vehicle. I provided her the case number and information she
               needed. She stated her husband was at the WSU vs UO football
               game and she would text him to let him know. I also advised her
               I had left a card on the windshield. I asked her to send me an
               estimate for the damage when they received one and she stated
               she would. I downloaded the video to the S: drive and the
               photos to Files. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 22nd day of September, 2014, in

               Coliseum. The male had been in the grass for over an hour. We

               identified via his concealed weapons permit as Inwards, Paul S.
               (07/28/76). Inwards was intoxicated. He fumbled through his

               and I did not see it. Inwards said he drank too much earlier in
               the day at the Fieldhouse. He was lying in the grass waiting
               for the bus to take him back home to the Tri Cities. Inward was
               next to the buses and oriented. His welfare was determined to
               not be in danger, just intoxicated. No further investigation. I

               about 2314 hours Pullman Fire and WSU Police were dispatched to
               an unconscious male near the climbing wall at the WSU Student
               Recreation Center. I responded to the area. I had difficulty
               locating the male. He was finally found coming out of the brush
               near the SRC ropes course on Orchard at Valley Rd. The male was
               assisted out of the brush by a citizen. I identified the male
               as Creager, Joseph A. (08/16/60). Creager was very intoxicated
               and had a difficult time standing or answering my questions.
               Medical aid was not needed. His cell was ringing. I told him to
               answer the phone. I spoke to a male on his phone. The caller
               said they are near Johnson Hall and will drive to my location
               to pick up Creager. For some unknown reason Creager wandered
               off in the wrong direction after the game. Alcohol was a factor
               in Creager ending up in the willow brush. Creager's friends
               eventually showed up and transported him back to the Tri
               Cities. No further investigation. I certify and declare under

               NARRATIVE: On 092014 at approximately 2352 hours I responded to
               a 4 vehicle injury collision on Grimes Way just east of the
               Cattle Feed Lab annex. When I arrived, Sgt. Jacobson, Asst.
               Chief Hansen, and Ofc. Jones were already on scene. I drove to
               the east end of the collision and began traffic control.
               Approximately 15 minutes later, Intern Wolff came to my end of
               the collision to relieve me of traffic control duties. I then
               checked in with Sgt. Jacobson to see if they needed anything or
               if I should clear the scene. He instructed me to start the
               investigation of the collision. Ofc Jones took photographs of
               all vehicles and visible injuries. He got the information from
               the passengers of each vehicle while I spoke with each driver
               and prepared the exchange of information. Interns conducted
               traffic control. In speaking with each driver all of the

               stories were the same. Traffic was backed up after the WSU v
               Oregon football game. Vehicle 2, 3, and 4 were stationary
               waiting for traffic when vehicle 1 struck vehicle 2, pushing
               vehicle 2 into vehicle 3, and vehicle 3 into vehicle 4. Rebekah
               M. Mars (070194) commented that she was able hear the collision
               behind her and saw vehicle 1 push vehicle 2 into her vehicle
               (#3). Daniel R. Kern (061552) stated that the vehicle behind
               him must have been going rather fast as they were hit "hard".
               The area in which this occurred is on a transition zone from a
               gradual decline to a more steep grade. No driver that was
               struck stated that their foot was on the gas when hit. Vehicles
               1 and 2 were moved before pictures were taken. Vehicles 3 and 4
               were still in contact. Medics had responded and checked
               everyone for injuries. No one was transported. Mars was given
               cold packs for her injuries. When I spoke with Ivan R. Macedo
               (072296) he told me he had the music "too loud" and went to
               adjust it and then "it happened". I could not get him to
               elaborate much but he implied he knew he had rear-ended vehicle
               2 causing the chain reaction. He stated he thought he was
               driving at 10 mph and his passenger stated 15 mph. No skids
               were visible on scene. I did not detect the odor of intoxicants
               on anyone during my time on scene. I did not observe anyone
               shows signs of impairment. I completed the Sector exchange of
               information and provided a copy to each driver along with my
               business card. I explained to them how to handle their
               insurance companies. I informed Macedo that I would be mailing
               him an infraction for No Insurance unless he contacted me
               showing otherwise. No vehicles were towed. We all cleared.
               Nothing follows. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 21st day of September, 2014, in

               approximate 10 foot long vertical steel sign that read "Lower

               4Z0871328 2. NARRATIVE: On September 21st, 2014 at
               approximately 0109 hours I was driving northbound on Merman
               Drive near the Terrace Apartments when I noticed a blue Lexus
               sedan traveling southbound on Merman Drive catching up to the
               vehicle in front of it. I activated my in car radar (vehicle 4)
               and obtained a reading of 26 MPH for the first vehicle and 36
               MPH for the Lexus. The Lexus was catching up to the first
               vehicle quickly. When the Lexus passed my location I turned
               around it and caught up to it as it came to a stop at Merman
               Drive and Valley Road. The Lexus turned left onto Valley Road
               and I activated my emergency lights. The Lexus continued to
               drive for a while longer and finally came to a stop when it
               turned right onto Cove Way. I contacted the driver, Gurjant
               Singh Dhaliwal 10/17/94, identified myself, informed the driver
               I was recording, and explained the reason for the stop.
               Dhaliwal handed me his driver's license, proof of insurance,
               and vehicle registration. There were two passengers in the car
               at the time of the stop. I could smell the very strong odor of
               intoxicants coming from within the car. I asked Dhaliwal how
               much he had to drink tonight. Dhaliwal said he had nothing to
               drink. I asked Dhaliwal why I would smell alcohol coming from
               his car. Dhaliwal said he was at a party and someone had
               spilled alcohol on him. Dhaliwal was wearing grey sweatpants
               and I noticed several wet marks on his left pant leg. I asked
               Dhaliwal if I could check his eyes and he stated yes. I
               preformed an HGN test on Dhaliwal as he sat in the vehicle. I
               told Dhaliwal to follow the tip of my finger with his eyes only
               and do not move his head. During the HGN test I observed equal
               pupil size, equal tracking, lack of smooth pursuit, and
               distinct and sustained nystagmus in both eyes. Dhaliwal's eyes
               were bloodshot and watery. I told Dhaliwal that based on what I
               saw in his eyes I believed that he had been drinking. I asked
               Dhaliwal if he was willing to be more honest with me and again
               asked him how much he had to drink tonight. Dhaliwal said, "to
               be completely honest I had a beer at the party." I asked
               Dhaliwal if it was one beer and Dhaliwal changed his answer and
               said he had two beers. I asked Dhaliwal how long ago he had his
               beers. Dhaliwal said it was about 0000 hours. I asked Dhaliwal
               if he was willing to do some voluntary standardized field
               sobriety tests. Dhaliwal stated he would. The tests were

               conducted on the sidewalk of Cove Way. The sidewalk has a
               moderate grade running north to south. Dhaliwal was wearing a
               tee shirt, jeans, and tennis shoes at the time of the tests.
               The sidewalk was lit by street lights, patrol car spot light,
               and personal flashlight. I turned off my forward facing
               emergency lights prior to the tests. The first test I
               administered was the HGN test. I instructed Dhaliwal to stand
               with his heels and toes together and keep his arms at his
               sides. I told Dhaliwal to remain in that position while I
               administered the test. Dhaliwal stated he understood. I told
               Dhaliwal to follow the tip of my pen with his eyes only and not
               to move his head. I held my pen approximately 12-15 inches away
               from Dhaliwal's head. During the test I observed, equal pupil
               size, equal tracking, lack of smooth pursuit, and distinct and
               sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes. As
               Dhaliwal stood before me I could clearly smell the odor of
               intoxicants coming from his breath. I explained to Dhaliwal
               that I would be evaluating him on how well he followed my
               instructions as well as how well he performed the tests. The
               next test I administered was the walk and turn. I told Dhaliwal
               to place his left foot on an imaginary line before him. I then
               instructed Dhaliwal to place his right foot heel to toe in
               front of his left foot and keep his arms at his side. Dhaliwal
               got into the starting position as instructed. I told Dhaliwal
               to remain in that position as I gave further instructions. I
               told Dhaliwal, when I tell you to begin, don't begin until I
               tell you, you will take a series of nine heel to toe steps down
               the line, with your arms at your side, looking down at your
               feet, and counting your steps out loud. Once you reach your
               ninth step leave your lead foot planted and with your rear foot
               take a series of small steps until you are facing where you
               came from and again take nine return heel to toe steps. I
               demonstrated the test for Dhaliwal. I reminded Dhaliwal to keep
               his arms at his side, count his steps out loud, look down at
               his feet, and do not stop the test until he had completed it. I
               asked Dhaliwal if he understood and Dhaliwal said he did. I
               told Dhaliwal he could begin as soon as he was ready.
               Instruction Phase: While demonstrating the test, Dhaliwal lost
               his balance and stepped out of the starting position once.
               Dhaliwal did not get back into the starting position for the
               remainder of my demonstration. First Nine Steps: Dhaliwal
               missed heel to toe on steps, 1, 2, 6, 7, and 8. Dhaliwal
               stepped off line on step 6. Dhaliwal did not count his steps
               out loud and only took 8 steps. Dhaliwal turned the wrong way
               and took two steps to turn around. Return Nine Steps: Dhaliwal
               stepped off line and missed heel to toe on step 4. The next
               test I administered was the One Leg Stand. I instructed
               Dhaliwal to stand with his heels and toes together and keep his
               arms at his side. I told Dhaliwal to remain in that position
               while I gave him further instructions. I told Dhaliwal, when I
               tell you to begin, don't begin until I tell you, you will raise
               either leg of your choice and raise it six inches off the
               ground. You must point your toe so the sole of your shoe is
               parallel with the ground. While pointing your toe, keep your
               arms at your side, leg straight, look down at your foot and

               count out loud, one thousand one, one thousand two, one
               thousand three, and so on until I tell you to stop. If at any
               point you put your foot down, go ahead and pick it right back
               up and continue counting where ever you left off. I
               demonstrated the test and asked Dhaliwal if he understood and
               he stated yes. While demonstrating the test Dhaliwal raised his
               right leg to copy what I was doing. I told Dhaliwal to begin
               and he raised his right leg and pointed at it with both hands.
               Dhaliwal asked if he was doing it correctly and I told him to
               point with his toe not his hands. Dhaliwal said "1 Mississippi,
               1 1001, 1002, 1003, etc. Dhaliwal counted to 1018 in the 30
               seconds. I told Dhaliwal that the last test I had for him was
               the PBT. I explained what the PBT was, that it was voluntary,
               and it did not replace the evidentiary breath test. I found my
               PBT (Alco-Sensor FST #16805) in working condition. Dhaliwal
               provided a PBT sample of .095 at 0120 hours. I told Dhaliwal
               that he was under arrest for DUI and handcuffed (D/L) him. I
               advised Dhaliwal of his right to counsel and walked Dhaliwal
               over to my patrol car. At my instruction, Intern Fairbanks
               searched Dhaliwal incident to arrest. Nothing of evidentiary
               value was found. Dhaliwal was placed in the back seat of my
               patrol car. Dhaliwal became very emotional as was crying in the
               back of my patrol car. I told Dhaliwal that his vehicle was
               going to be towed and wanted to know if there was anything in
               the car he wanted out of it. Dhaliwal asked for his wallet and
               cell phone. About this time Ofc. Petlovany arrived on scene. I
               contacted the two remaining passengers who were in the Lexus. I
               explained the situation and told them they were going to need
               to find an alternative way to get home. The passengers were not
               identified. Ofc. Petlovany stayed with the vehicle and waited
               for the tow truck while I transported Dhaliwal to Pullman
               Police Department for BAC. Upon arrival I checked the
               Datamaster and found it working properly, with the RFI antenna
               attached, the mouth tube warm to the touch, and a temperature
               within ranges. At 0143 hours I checked Dhaliwal's mouth finding
               no foreign substances. I read Dhaliwal his Constitutional
               Rights at 0143 hours. Dhaliwal stated he understood his rights
               and signed he understood his rights and decided not to exercise
               his rights. I read Dhaliwal the Implied Consent Warning for
               Breath and Dhaliwal signed that it had been read to him at 0145
               hours. Dhaliwal stated he was willing to provide a breath
               sample. Dhaliwal provided a breath sample of .083 at 0216 hours
               and another sample of .084 at 0219 hours. The breath test was
               administered in accordance to the methods approved by the
               Washington State Toxicologist pursuant to the Washington
               Administrative Code. I provided Dhaliwal a copy of the
               following documents: Driver's Hearing Request, Notice of
               Hearing/Conditions of Release, tow and impound form, and the
               breath test document. Dhaliwal was issued Sector Citation
               4Z0871328 for RCW 46.61.502 DUI. I explained the citation and
               provided him with his copy. Dhaliwal was fingerprinted and
               photographed. At approximately 0355 hours Dhaliwal was released
               from custody. Dhaliwal's vehicle was impounded by Myer's Towing
               for 12 hours. My Taser Body camera footage was uploaded to the
               department's computer. Nothing further. I certify and declare

               0222 hours, WSU PD was dispatched to a citizen dispute in the
               area Spokane Street and Stadium Way. When I got to the area I
               spoke with Lanimarie Green-Rowley, she pointed me in the
               direction of the grassy area and stated a couple were arguing.
               I located Nicole Yamamoto in the Yellow lot between Main Street
               and Spokane Street. While I was talking with Yamamoto, Officer
               Kelly went and spoke with Jarod Ashford. Yamamoto told me the
               following; she and Ashford are dating and they went to the game
               together. She said Ashford was not from the area and they got
               separated. When she located Ashford again he thought she had
               intentionally left him. I asked her if there was any shoving or
               hitting. She said no there was not they were just arguing. I
               spoke to Officer Kelly, He state Ashford had told him that
               right and the end of the game Yamamoto had hit him in the
               chest. After that they were just arguing. I went back and asked
               Yamamoto about her hitting Ashford. She stated it was right at
               the end of the game when he was giving her the Oregon
               University sign so she more pushed him the hit in the chest.
               This was done in fun because of the game and not because they
               were arguing. I went back to Ashford and asked him the context
               of the hit or push. He stated he was showing her the Oregon
               sign and bragging because they beat WSU and she pushed him in
               the chest when he had his hands up. He also stated it was more
               in playfulness then because of any argument or fighting. I
               determined the actual fight between Ashford and Yamamoto was
               verbal only. They were both counseled on domestic violence. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC:BEJ/314 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W3660 SYNOPSIS Shelby Romero called to
               report her friend was distraught over a past relationship. I
               found Elizabeth Porter siting in the middle of Library road
               crying and she didn't make sense. She appeared to have consumed
               a large amount of alcohol. I placed Porter in protective
               custody and transported her to Pullman Regional Hospital.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 21
               September 2014 at 0416 hours I was dispatched to a welfare
               check between Morrow Hall and Lighty student services building.
               I located Elizabeth Porter in front of Bryan Hall she was
               sitting down in the middle of Library Road. Porter appeared to
               have consumed a significant amount of alcohol. Initially she
               stated she had been kicked in the head and didn't remember most
               of the night. When I asked why she was crying she stated she
               had hit someone with her car on prom night and killed them but
               had not been caught. She said this happened in May of 2014. She
               then said a boy had found about it and used it to force her to
               date him. She also talked incoherently about her mother and her
               sister. Pullman ambulance came to evaluate her with regards to
               her stating she had been kicked in the head. Pullman ambulance
               felt she had not been kicked. Officer Westerman spoke with with
               Porter's friends Heather Goode, Shelby Romero, and Sage
               Ferguson. They told him they had been trying to get her home
               for the last hour and had been unsuccessful. Porter was clearly
               unable to care for herself and was in a public place. I placed
               her in protective custody and took her to Pullman Regional
               Hospital. I forgot to fill out the protective custody paperwork
               at the hospital. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this ____ day of _____________,
               2014, in Pullman, Washington.
