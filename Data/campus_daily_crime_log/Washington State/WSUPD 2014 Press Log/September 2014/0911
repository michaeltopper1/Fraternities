               September 11, 2014 at about 0816 hours I was dispatched to the
               report of a damaged utility box near the Valley Playfields at
               Valley Road and Orchard Drive. I responded to the area. I
               located a telephone pedestal that had some exposed wires. The
               top of the pedestal had come off and the two vertical shell
               pieces were separated. It is unknown how this happened or when.
               The pedestal looked like it could be easily reassembled and
               closed up. I estimate damage at $25.00 for the labor to
               reassemble the pieces. The pedestal belongs to Frontier
               Communications. Whitcom called Frontier at my request. There
               are no suspects, witnesses or leads. No further investigation.

               02/17/96 Victim 2. Lexi Vaughan Suspect Stalking/Harassment
               NARRATIVE: On 09/11/14 at approximately 1420 hours I responded
               to Gannon-Goldsworthy Hall and met with Sarah Al-Rashoodi (RED)
               and Jessica Gonzalez. I asked what I could do to help. Gonzalez
               explained she was interested in learning how to obtain a
               protection order. I explained to Gonzalez the process and
               provided her with resource paperwork. I directed Gonzalez to
               contact ATVP as well if she wanted their assistance. I
               explained to Gonzalez the ATVP's role as well as University
               resources available. I asked Gonzalez if she could explain to
               me the situation. Gonzalez told me the follow. Gonzalez was
               friends with Lexi Vaughan for 4 years during high school
               (Chapparel High School) in Parker, Colorado. Gonzalez explained
               that just prior to March of 2014 she told Vaughan she did not
               want any further contact from her, due to attachment issues and
               Vaughan showing up to random locations that Gonzalez was going
               to. Gonzalez explained that Vaughan continued to contact her in
               person or through social media or her friends. Gonzalez
               explained that on 03/17/14 she had surgery and when she was
               recovering at home Vaughan showed up to her house uninvited.
               Gonzalez's parents to Vaughan to leave, which she did. Gonzalez
               continued to sent her a message on facebook to not contact her
               anymore. Gonzalez said she continued to receive messages from
               Vaughan. Gonzalez said one morning she noticed Vaughan's
               vehicle parked outside of her house at 0630 in the morning.
               Gonzalez said that at 0730when she had to leave for school she
               noticed Vaughan's vehicle was blocking hers. Gonzalez explained
               that during an award's ceremony Vaughan showed up and grabbed
               Gonzalez by the arm demanding to speak with her. Gonzalez said
               she had to push Vaughan away to get her to let go. I asked
               Gonzalez if she had reported anything to the locate police
               department in Parker and she said she had not. Gonzalez said
               the last time she had communication with her was in April of
               2014 when she messaged Vaughan again telling her to not contact
               her. At this point Gonzalez blocked all communications from
               Vaughan (phone and social media). Gonzalez said that on
               09/09/14 she went to check her mail and received a package from
               Cheryl's (an on-line confectionery delivery service). Gonzalez
               noticed on the bottom of the packing slip it said "A gift to

               you from Lexi Vaughan". Gonzalez said she opened the package
               and inside was a single chocolate chocolate chip cookie.
               Gonzalez explained that she was very concerned that Vaughan had
               her address. Gonzalez said the only people that know her
               address at Pullman is her family and they would not have
               provided this information. Gonzalez said she was concerned
               about Vaughan coming to WSU and attempting to contact her. I
               asked Gonzalez if she knew Vaughan's complete information
               (name, address, etc.) and she said she did not. I explained to
               Gonzalez that I would attempt to contact Chaparrel High School
               and speak with the School Resource Officer to obtain the
               information as it would be needed for an order to be
               issued/served. I provided Gonzalez with my business card, case
               number, and contact information. I re-iterated to Gonzalez the
               available resources and provided her directions to District
               Court. Gonzalez provided me with the package, which I took to
               WSUPD and logged into evidence. I returned to WSUPD and called
               Douglas County (Colorado) dispatch and spoke with Sean. I
               explained the circumstances to Sean and he attempted to locate
               Vaughan's information in their system, but was unsuccessful.
               Sean sent me to Tom Brinkworth's (School Resource Officer for
               Chaparrel) voice mail. I left Brinkworth a message to contact
               me about the investigation. Investigation continues. On
               09/11/14 I emailed the above information to OEO. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of

               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 091114 around 1901 hrs I was
               dispatched to a report of a window being broken in apartment A-
               20 of the Chief Joe Apartments. I contacted the reporting
               party, later identified as Amethyst M Beaulieu (072492), and
               told the following. Beaulieu explained she had been sitting in
               her living room when a softball struck and broke the sliding
               glass section of her living room window. She went on to tell me
               he had been contacted by Daylan M Burch (022896), who had hit
               the ball, and Robert C McMurtray (052091), of university
               recreation about the damage. Beaulieu explained she had already
               contacted the WSU Police Department regarding the damage and
               was told by McMurtray that he couldn't do anything else now
               that I had become involved. Beaulieu gave the softball back to
               McMurtray and Burch and they returned to the Valley Rd
               Playfield to resume their game. I told Beaulieu that I would
               like to take photos of the damage and upon my arrival took
               pictures of the window, which were later downloaded to this
               case. Prior to leaving I provided Beaulieu with my business
               card and case number. I went on to explain she needed to
               contact risk management to get the window repaired. She told me
               she understood and I cleared and went to locate McMurtray and
               Burch. Upon locating them they explained the same thing
               Beaulieu had and after obtaining their information I cleared.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 11th day of September, 2014, in

               approximately 2009 hours, I was requested to contact RED
               Doolittle reference a advice on a possible incident in the
               hall. She stated a staff member had documented being told about
               a rumor of one of their residents being 16 years of age. They
               stated the rumor was she was having sex with males living on
               the 10th and 7th floors. There was also a rumor the males were
               providing her with alcohol and or drugs. There is no names of
               the males or room numbers. One of the staff members had spoken
               to the 16 year old and was told it was none of their business.
               Doolittle stated she had been advised by Central Staff to
               document the issue with us. I asked her if she had spoken to
               the juvenile yet and she said no. She stated she was going to
               try and speak with her tomorrow and would send the information
               to WSU Counseling Services to see if they had any advice. The
               juvenile was never seen in possession of alcohol, drugs, or
               under the influence of either. There is no information on who
               any of the males may be. I confirmed the juvenile's name with
               Doolittle and found she had an ID card issued out of Arizona.
               There is no other information substantiating the rumors and all
               information is third party. I advised Doolittle to contact me
               if she gained any further information after speaking with the
               juvenile or need any further assistance. She stated she would.
               Information only. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 12th day of
