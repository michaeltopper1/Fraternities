               Whitman County Humane Society. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 09/28/14 at approximately 2215
               hours I responded to Perham Hall where a stray cat had been
               captured on the 3rd floor. Upon arrival I contacted Julie A.
               Johnson 07/06/95, who was sitting in the hallway with about 10
               other females. The group said the found the cat wandering
               around the floor and nobody knew where it came from. The group
               said the cat was very nice and they feed it some tuna and milk.
               I took custody of the cat which had no collar. While walking to
               my patrol car several people in the lobby of Streit Perham said
               they have seen that cat wandering around the building for the
               last few weeks. Nobody knew who the cat belonged too. Based on
               the comments from the passerby's, I believe that the cat was
               brought into the building by one of the residents. I took the
               cat to the Whitman County Humane Society and put the cat in the
               after hours drop off. I filled out the paperwork for WCHS and
               cleared. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
