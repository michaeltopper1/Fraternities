    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Olmstead/339 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W3783 SYNOPSIS: Moira E. Culkin (DOB 08-
               25-1994) reported that she had located her stolen cellular
               telephone in Perham Hall. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR#
               1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 09-27-2014 at about 0949 hrs I was
               dispatched to a report of stolen property at Perham Hall,
               located at 1624 NE Cougar Way. I arrived on scene and contacted
               Moira E. Culkin (DOB 08-25-1994) and two of her friends. Culkin
               told me that on 09-26-2014 at about 2300 hrs she was visiting
               with friends in a house near Campus Street and Ruby Street in
               Pullman, Washington. Culkin did not know the address for this
               house. Culkin said her cellular telephone was plugged into a
               speaker in the living room. Later that same night at about 2330
               hrs Culkin realized that her telephone was missing and had been
               taken. Culkin and her friends used the "Find My iPhone"
               application to track her telephone to Perham Hall. Culkin and
               her friends entered Perham Hall and walked the hallways while
               remotely activating the alarm tone on the telephone. Culkin
               said they heard the alarm tone for her telephone coming from
               inside room #610. Culkin said they knocked on the door, but
               there was no answer. Culkin said she decided to call the police
               for assistance. Culkin remotely activated the alarm on her
               telephone, and I could hear a beeping sound originating from
               inside room #610. Culkin showed me the results of the Find My
               iPhone search, and I saw that it currently indicated the
               telephone was in Perham Hall. Culkin described her cellular
               telephone as: iPhone 5S, white in color, no protective case,
               lock code password 0825, telephone number 509-999-3416. Culkin
               estimated the value of her telephone to be $500.00. I contacted
               Officer Crow from the Pullman Police Department (PPD) and
               informed him that Culkin's telephone had been stolen from PPD's
               jurisdiction and was now apparently located in Perham Hall.
               After discussing the situation with Officer Crow, it was
               decided that I would continue with my investigation. I
               identified the residents of room #610 as Austin R. Whittendale
               (DOB 01-09-1996) and Carter A. Galgano (DOB 08-14-1995). While
               I was speaking with Culkin, her friends advised that they had
               contacted Whittendale through a mutual friend at the Lamba Chi
               Alpha fraternity. According to Culkin's friends, Whittendale
               stated that he had "found" Culkin's telephone last night and
               took it. Culkin and her friends made arrangements for
               Whittendale to return Culkin's telephone. Culkin said she did
               not wish to pursue criminal charges against Whittendale and
               told me she did not want him to get in trouble. Culkin told me

               that she believed Whittendale had taken her telephone by
               accident. Culkin confirmed that she did not need any further
               assistance from the police department and told me she would get
               her telephone back from Whittendale later today. I told Culkin
               that I would check with her tomorrow to make sure she had
               obtained her telephone. I cleared the scene. Investigation
               continues. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this __27__ day of

               was dispatched to a lockout at Vogel. I responded to Vogel and
               contacted the complainant Katerina M Tsatsomersos (11/04/95).
               Tsatsomersos needed access to Johnson C106. The Apparel and
               Merchandise Department told the students to access Johnson Hall
               via Vogel. Vogel has card readers and Johnson does not.
               Tsatsomersos's card is "denied" at Vogel. She said she can
               sometimes swipe her card and then pull on the door and it will
               open, even though the card reader shows "denied." I escorted
               Tsatsomersos into Johnson Hall. She successfully swiped into
               Johnson C106. I told her to contact her department about after
               hours building access. Assistance provided, no further

               dispatched to a one (1) vehicle non injury collision at Davis
               Way and Bluebunch Drive. Pullman Police requested an agency

               contacted the driver Kandice S. Held. Held told me she was
               attempting to back up and turn around as Bluebunch Drive has no
               outlet. She backed her vehicle into a cluster mailbox knocking
               it over. Damage to Held's vehicle was a vertical scratch on the
               rear bumper. The plastic base to the mailbox broke. The mailbox
               was lying on it's side. Digital photos of the vehicle and
               mailbox were taken. I contacted the postmaster at the Pullman
               Post Office. I told him about the damaged mailbox and provided
               him with an exchange of information. A Sector PTCR has been
               completed. No infractions, citations, or charges to be filed.
               No further investigation. I certify and declare under penalty

               stated that the saw two females appeared to be the childs
               sisters. They were trying to get him into the vehicle so they
               could leave. One of the females left and came back with the
               mother. The mother told the child to get in the vehicle and he
               did. The three left in the vehicle and the mother went back
               inside the coliseum. This appeared to be a family issue. I
               search the area for the vehicle but didn't find it. Nothing

               Conduct Poss/Marijuana-Alcohol NARRATIVE: ON 09-27-14 I was
               dispatched to a drugs call in Olympia Hall. The R/P was hall
               staff and they stated that one of the residents of #412 had
               some people over to have a party. They had been smoking
               marijuana and drinking. I responded to the area and contacted
               Hall Staff Jenafer Doolittle. She stated that the two females,
               Bernadette Sho and Paige L. Goodman were in #412. There were
               conflicting stories about what was going on. I contacted the
               two. Both said that they had a party with some friends. They
               left to get snacks and when they returned the other party goers
               had been drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana. Goodman is the
               resident and Sho is a neighbor. I asked Goodman if her
               roommate, later identified as Jona M. Wagner, gave permission
               to have the party and she said "Yes." Both Goodman and Sho has
               bloodshot watery eyes and slurred speech. In asked if the two
               had drank any alcohol and both admitted to drinking a few
               beers. I looked in the room from the door and didn't seen any
               alcohol or marijuana. I didn't smell the odor of either items.
               I told the two I was going to speak to Wagner and left them in
               the room. I went to a room down the hall and contacted the
               roommate and two friends, Jona M. Wagner, Megan S. Frazier, and
               Haylee D. Reynolds. Wagner stated that she had agreed for
               Goodman to have her boyfriend a Jordan Trullio to have a small
               party. She came into the room at about 2200 hours and there was
               beer and hard alcohol all over the room. The room smelled
               strongly of burnt marijuana and she saw a small joint on the
               counter. She told Goodman that she didn't approved. She left
               the room and got her two friends. They came back and took a
               couple pictures of the room and caller hall staff. Hall staff
               then called the police. Megan Frazier told me that she saw a
               small marijuana joint on the desk. Sho admitted to Frazier that
               it was hers, picked it up, then took it to the bathroom and
               flushed it. The three left the room. When the door was closed
               they over heard the two talking about hiding the other alcohol.
               They hid the alcohol in Sho's room in her suitcase. I told
               Wagner I would re-contact the two and resolve the situation. I
               also told her that if she started being harassed to call 911
               and let the police handle it. She said she would and I left the

               Goodman's boyfriend Jordan Trullio. I asked the three to return
               to #412 and they did. I told them that I didn't appreciate
               being lied to. I told them that I knew it was them that had the
               party, invited all the other people, there was marijuana being
               smoked, alcohol being drank and that the left over alcohol was
               being stored in Sho's suitcase in her room. Goodman admitted to
               having the party and drinking alcohol. She said she was scared
               and that's why she lied. Sho admitted that she brought the
               marijuana and to smoking it in the room. I told the two females
               I would be referring them to student conduct. I asked them to
               bring out all the alcohol that was left. Sho went to her room
               and brought back 4 bottles of hard alcohol and one coors light
               can. Sho poured them down the sink. I told Trullio(He is not a
               WSU Student), that I recognized his name from a MIP a week or
               two ago. I told him that one more incident here in the hall he
               would be trespassed. He said that there would not be any more
               problems. I told Goodman I was referring them to student
               conduct and warned them for making false or misleading
               statement to a public servant and cleared the area. Nothing

               0131 hours, I was dispatched to a physical assault which had
               occurred at 720 NE B Street, Community Duncun Dunn 2nd floor. I
               was told the witnesses were in the lounge on the second floor.
               I arrived and spoke with Amanda Adkins and Janell Gard. They
               provided the following description of what had occurred. Around
               0030 hours, Gard and Adkins were in the lounge on the 2nd
               floor. They saw a woman, Kailey Bostic, run past with a man,
               Eli Volynsky, chasing her. They stated Bostic was trying to use
               her phone and Volynsky was attempting to take it away from her.
               Bostic fell to the ground at which time Volynsky took her cell
               phone and her shoes and ran back to his room, Community Duncun
               Dunn 233. Bostic came into the lounge crying and asked Gard and
               Adkins for help. Gard and Adkins went with Bostic to the 3rd
               floor in attempt to find her friend which lived there. The
               person was not home so the three women went down to Volynsky's
               room in attempt to retrieve Bostic's possessions. They knocked
               on Volynsky's door and he opened it a crack. When he saw Bostic
               he grabbed her and used force in attempting to pull her into
               his room. When he saw Gard and Adkins he pushed Bostic out and
               slammed the door shut. Bostic, Gard, and Adkins asked Keenan
               and another man for help in getting Bostic possessions back
               from Volynsky. As they were walking back towards Volynsky's
               room he met them in the hallway as they rounded a corner. As
               they were talking with Volynsky he grabbed Bostic and pulled
               her by the wrist back to his room. He was able to force Bostic
               into his room using force to drag her into the room. While she
               was being pulled Bostic was yelling no help. Adkins, Gard, and
               one of the men were able to keep keep Volynsky from shutting
               the door and were able to get Bostic and her possession out of
               the room. Gard and Adkins were getting Bostic to Gard's room

               aside attempting to get to Bostic. Gard was able to get Bostic
               into her room and shut the door. They then called he Resident
               Advisor who called the WSU police. While I was speaking with
               Gard and Bostic. Sergeant Griffin was speaking to Bostic.
               Bostic confirmed with Sgt Griffin the events from above plus
               more. I conferred with Sgt Griffin and we agreed we had
               probable cause for Unlawful imprisonment, Assault 4th degree,
               and theft 3rd degree. This also fell under the domestic
               violence mediatory arrest since Bostic and Volynsky had been
               dating since November 2012. Sgt Griffin and Officer Westerman
               went to Volynsky's room to speak with him. Volynsky would not
               come out his room. I went back the room Bostic was in to get
               her written statement. I then went back to the police
               department to write an arrest warrant for Volynsky since he
               wouldn't come out of his room. Judge Robinson issued the arrest
               warrant for Volynsky. I went back up to Volynsky's room and
               found him standing inside the room with his door open speaking
               with Officer Westerman. I informed Volynsky we had a warrant
               for his arrest and read the warrant to him. Following reading
               the warrant I advised Volynsky he was under arrest for Unlawful
               Imprisonment and 4th degree assault. Sgt. Griffin advised
               Volynsky he had the right to an attorney. Sgt. Griffin
               transported Volynski to Colfax and turned him over to Shari
               Aune of Whitman County Juvenile Service. Ms. Volynsky called
               about her son and I put her in contact with Ms. Aune. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
