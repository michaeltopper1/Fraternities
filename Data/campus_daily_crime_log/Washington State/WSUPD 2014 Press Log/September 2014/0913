               NARRATIVE: On 09/13/14 at about 1518 hrs I was working at the
               WSU vs PSU football game in Martin Stadium. I was standing just
               outside gate I at the stairs leading up from student plaza when
               I noticed a male, later identified as Austin C. Edwards
               (061096), who was walking up the stairs. He caught my attention
               because he appeared to be under the age of 21 and was stumbling
               side to side as he walked. I contacted Edwards just inside
               Martin Stadium. I asked how much he had to drink and he said "I
               don't know". I asked if I could check his eyes and he agreed. I
               administered a horizontal gaze nystagmus test on him and
               observed he had bloodshot and watery eyes, a lack of smooth
               pursuit, and a distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum
               deviation in both eyes. I could smell the odor of intoxicants
               on Edwards' breath as I administered the test. I had to remind
               Edwards not to move his head during the test. I asked Edwards
               for his ID and he provided me with his WA driver's license. I
               advised Edwards he was under arrest for MIP Exhibiting and
               escorted him to the processing room. I advised Edwards he was
               being ejected from Martin Stadium. I read him the ejection
               notice and he received a copy. I told him I would be forwarding
               charges for MIP Exhibiting to the Whitman County Prosecutor. I
               escorted Edwards from the stadium. Nothing further. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.

               04/19/96 Charges Forwarded MIP Exhibiting 2. NARRATIVE: On
               09/13/14 at approximately 1545 hours Deputy Goldsby was working
               at Martin Stadium for the WSU football game when I was directed
               to gate A by Pro Staff. Pro Staff stated there was a male who
               was intoxicated and trying to get into the stadium. I walked
               outside of the Stadium and found the male near the ambulances.
               As I was walking up to the male I noticed he was stumbling side
               to side while he was walking towards me. The male also appeared
               to be under the age of 21. I told the male I needed to talk to
               him and he stopped. The male, later identified as Torsen James
               Etscheid 04/19/96, started to say he remembered me from a
               public program I did at Rogers Hall. As Torsen spoke his words
               were heavily slurred. Dep. Goldsby asked Torsen how old he was
               and Torsen said 21 years old. I asked for Torsen's ID. While
               Torsen struggled to get his wallet out of his pocket, I
               mentioned that I believed Torsen to be under the age of 21
               because he lives in Rogers Hall which is a freshman dorm. Due
               to Torsen's intoxication level, Dep. Goldsby asked Torsen if he
               wanted help getting his wallet out. Torsen said yes and Dep.
               Goldsby was able to remove his wallet. Torsen handed me his
               WADL that identified himself as 18 years old. I asked Torsen
               how much he had to drink and he said not that much. I asked how
               much that was. Torsen said he had about 4 shots of alcohol. I
               asked Torsen if I could check his eyes and he said I could.
               Torsen tried to put his sunglasses on and I told him to leave
               them off. Torsen started to put his glasses in his pocket. When
               he did so he grabbed his right corner of his shirt and raised
               it. When Torsen did so I noticed a Dasani water bottle tucked
               in his waist band. I asked Torsen to place his heels and toes
               together. When Torsen did so he stumbled to his right. During
               the HGN test I observed, equal tracking, lack of smooth
               pursuit, and distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum
               deviation. During the test Torsen was swaying side to side. I
               could clearly smell the odor of intoxicants coming from his
               breath. I asked Torsen if he was willing to provide a PBT
               sample and he said no. I told Torsen that he was under arrest
               for MIP Exhibiting and handcuffed (D/L) him. I advised Torsen
               of his right to counsel. While handcuffing Torsen he said he
               wanted to provide a breath sample. I told Torsen that he could
               once we were at the processing room if he wanted to. Once we

               were at the processing room I asked Torsen if he wanted to
               still provide a PBT sample. Torsen said he would. I found my
               PBT (Alco-Sensor FST #16805) in working condition. Torsen
               provided a PBT sample of .243. Torsen was searched incident to
               arrest by Dep. Goldsby. The water bottle I had seen earlier was
               removed. Dep. Goldsby opened the bottle and determined the
               bottle was filled with vodka. I asked Torsen a series of
               questions to determine his mental status. Torsen, however very
               intoxicated, was able to answer all my questions correctly. We
               called several sober people to come pick Torsen up. After quite
               a while Torsen's friend, Elias Cole Williams 01/31/96 came to
               pick him up. Prior to releasing Torsen I poured out the water
               bottle full of vodka in the processing room sink as Dep.
               Goldsby witnessed. I walked Torsen outside of the Stadium and
               read him a copy of the ejection order. I also explained that I
               would be forwarding charges of MIP Exhibiting to the
               Prosecutor. Torsen stated he understood. Torsen walked away and
               I returned to the game. Nothing further. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               and released for MIP Exhibiting. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Josue E. Ponce 12/24/94 Cited/Released MIP
               Exhibiting C8979 2. NARRATIVE: On 09/13/14 at approximately
               1625 hours I was at Martin Stadium working the WSU football
               game. I was requested to respond to the area of section 31
               where WSU Interns had found a very intoxicated male. Upon
               arrival I found, Josue Emmanuel Ponce 12/24/94 standing near
               the section 31 gate. Ponce appeared to be confused and was
               standing still. I walked up to Ponce and asked what was going
               on. Ponce had a blank look upon his face like he was staring
               off into nowhere. Ponce appeared to be under the age of 21. I
               asked Ponce if he had his ID with him and he said no. I asked
               Ponce how he got into the football game without any ID. Ponce
               said he had his cougar card. I asked to see it and Ponce
               removed his wallet. When Ponce opened his wallet I could see
               his WADL. I asked for Ponce's WADL and he handed it to me.
               Ponce's driver's license identified him as 19 years old. I
               asked Ponce how much he had to drink today and he said one
               beer. I asked Ponce if I could check his eyes and he said I
               could. Ponce was leaning up against a wall for support so I
               asked him to step away from it which he did. During the HGN
               test I observed equal tracking, lack of smooth pursuit, and
               distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation. When I
               started the test, Ponce immediately move his head to follow my
               pen. Ponce moved his head several times to follow the pen
               instead of keeping it still as instructed. As Ponce stood
               before me I could clearly smell the odor of intoxicants coming
               from his breath. Ponce was swaying side to side during the
               test. Ponce's eyes were bloodshot and watery. It was clear that
               Ponce was highly intoxicated. I asked Ponce if he was willing
               to provide a PBT test. Ponce said "why don't you give it to
               these..." and pointed to the crowd around him. I told Ponce I
               was asking him not other people. Ponce seemed confused and I
               had to ask him to focus on what I was asking him. Ponce said he
               did not want to. I told Ponce that he was under arrest for MIP
               and handcuffed (D/L) him. Ponce said he would do the PBT and I
               told him he could do it at the processing room if he wished. I
               walked Ponce to the processing room. Once at the processing
               room Ofc. Kirshner advised me that Ponce has been arrested for
               Theft 3rd Degree and Possession of Marijuana within the last
               year. I filled out a criminal citation for Ponce. I asked Ponce
               if he wanted to take the PBT and Ponce said no. I asked Ponce

               several questions to determine his mental status. Ponce was
               able to answer all my questions correctly. I attempted to
               contact someone to pick Ponce up for approximately 15 minutes
               without any luck. While I was trying to contact someone for
               Ponce, Ponce became very emotional and started to cry. It was
               clear that Ponce's intoxication was making if difficult for him
               to control his emotions. It was decided that Ponce would be
               fine to release to himself. I walked Ponce outside the stadium
               and issued him criminal citation C8979 for RCW 66.44.270.2B MIP
               Exhibiting. I explained the citation to Ponce and provided him
               with his copy. I also read Ponce an ejection notice and gave it
               to him. Ponce was released from custody and I went back to the
               game. Ponce has been contacted 6 times for alcohol or drugs
               since August of 2013. Nothing further. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               hrs I was working at Martin Stadium for the WSU vs PSU football
               game. I was standing outside Gate I when I noticed a female,
               later identified as Ashlee D. Betancourth (032794), who was
               walking into the stadium. She caught my attention because she
               appeared to be under the age of 21 and was having difficulty
               walking, stumbling side to side and using her friends for
               balance. I contacted Betancourth and asked how much she had to
               drink. She said she had about two drinks. I asked if I could
               look at her eyes and she agreed. I administered a horizontal
               gaze nystagmus test on her. I observed she had bloodshot and
               watery eyes and a lack of smooth pursuit. I had to remind her
               not to move her head during the test and I could smell the odor
               of intoxicants on her breath as I administered the test.
               Betancourth said she did not have any ID with her. She provided
               me with her name and date of birth, which confirmed she was
               under the age of 21. I advised Betancourth she was under arrest
               for MIP Exhibiting and escorted her to the processing room. She
               was verbally uncooperative and disrespectful in the processing
               room. I issued Betancourth citation #8980 for MIP Exhibiting. I
               explained the citation to her, she received her copy. I read
               her the ejection notice and provided her with a copy. I
               escorted her from the stadium and she was released. As she was
               being released she was complaining about how I needed to come
               with her to talk to her dad. I told her I did not wish to speak
               wit her father as he was not with her at the time of arrest. I
               instructed her she needed to leave or she would be arrested for
               trespassing. Betancourth left the area. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and

               vs. Portland State football game when I was called to respond
               to Section 36 of Martin Stadium for an intoxicated female.
               WSUPD Intern Alex Elwell reported that there was a highly
               intoxicated female in the section who was staggering while she
               walked and needed assistance to get to her seat due to her
               extreme intoxication. I contacted Elwell and he pointed out a
               female later identified as Carly C. Ellingsen. I contacted
               Ellingsen and asked her to come to the top of the section where
               the concourse sidewalk was. She complied and I followed her up
               the stairs to the concourse. I noticed that she nearly missed
               several steps and she was staggering from side to side as she
               walked up the stairs. Her face was flushed, her eyes were
               bloodshot and watery, and she smelled strongly of intoxicants.
               I contacted her at the concourse and asked her how old she was.
               Ellingsen stated she was 20. I asked her how much she had to
               drink and she stated she had some drinks. While she was
               talking, her speech was slurred and the odor of inoxicants was
               strong on her breath. I asked her to follow me to the
               processing room and she complied. In the processing room, I
               asked her if she would provide a PBT sample of her breath. She
               told me she would and provided a sample of .189. I asked her to
               call a friend to walk home with her and she did. I advised her
               that she was trespassed from Martin Stadium, that this case was
               going to WSU Student Conduct, and that charges were being
               forwarded on her for Minor Exhibiting the Effects of Having
               Consumed Alcohol in a Public Place. Ellingsen told me she
               understood. I released Ellingsen to some friends who escorted
               her out of Gate A of Martin Stadium. Nothing further. I certify

               the odor of intoxicants emitting from her breath and her speech
               was slurred. I also observed she was swaying as she stood in a
               circular motion, and her eyes appeared to be red, glassy and
               sleepy. She also stated several times she just lived across the
               street and would go home. The other female was identified by
               Ofc. Welter as Allsion J. Gardner. I could see she was having
               trouble standing and her speech was extremely slurred. She also
               had the odor of intoxicants emitting from her breath as she
               spoke. Allison was the subject being held up by Cougar Security
               when we arrived. I advised both females I would be forwarding
               charges on them for Minor Exhibiting in a Public Place and they
               stated they understood. I asked Alexa for her mother's name as
               she was a juvenile. She stated her mother's name was Diana
               Ferrara. I asked her if she had a cell phone and she said yes.
               I had her call her mother so I could speak with her. I talked
               to Diana and explained the situation to her. I stated I would
               make sure Alexa got home safely if she was okay with me
               releasing her and she said yes. I told both females they were
               not allowed to attend the game and after a few minutes of them
               trying to find a friend to come walk them home, I had Cougar
               Security escort them to their residence hall. They were both
               advised that if they were found out in public while still
               intoxicated they would be subject to arrest again. Ofc. Welter
               and I cleared. I downloaded my video to the S: drive. Refer to

               09/13/14 at about 1708 hrs I was working at the WSU vs PSU
               football game in Martin Stadium. I was walking through the
               outer concourse near section 30 when I noticed a female, later
               identified as Sydney L. Travis (112795), who was walking
               through the concourse. She caught my attention because she
               appeared to be under the age of 21 and was having difficulty
               walking. She was using two friends for balance and still
               stumbled side to side as she walked. I contacted Travis and
               asked how much she had to drink. She told me she was fine.
               Travis swayed side to side as she stood and spoke with slurred
               speech. I asked if I could check her eyes and she said yes. I
               administered a horizontal gaze nystagmus test on her. I
               observed she had bloodshot and watery eyes and a lack of smooth
               pursuit. I could smell the odor of intoxicants on Travis'
               breath. I asked if she had her ID with her and she provided me
               with her Washington Driver's license, which confirmed she was
               under 21. I advised Travis she was under arrest for MIP
               Exhibiting. I escorted Travis to the processing room where I
               read her an ejection notice and provided her with a copy. I
               told Travis I would be forwarding charges for MIP Exhibiting to
               the Whitman County Prosecutor and she was escorted from the
               stadium. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 13 day of September,

               subject at Waller Hall. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               WHITE, Morgan D. EMS/WARNED Intoxication None 04/19/96 2.
               NARRATIVE: On September 13, 2014 WSU Police and Pullman Fire
               were dispatched to Waller Hall room 43 for an intoxicated
               subject. Officer Welter and I responded to the room. We were
               escorted to the room by hall staff. When I entered the room I
               saw a male lying on his back on a bed. He was wearing only
               underwear. The male was later identified as Morgan D. White
               (04/19/96). I advised White that I was recording. I could smell
               the odor of alcohol in the room. White is a WSU student. White
               was conscious and alert. He was able to answer questions. White
               was oriented to place and person. He was not oriented to
               time/date. He admitted to drinking beer. The exact amount of
               alcohol consumed is unknown. White was able to stand on his
               own. Pullman Fire personnel arrived on scene and evaluated
               White. It was obvious that he had been drinking as he had
               slurred speech, red watery eyes, lack of coordination, and the
               odor of intoxicants coming from his breath as he spoke. I
               attempted several times to get a BAC level from White using my
               FST. He would not provide an adequate breath sample. It was
               determined that White could remain in his room. Hall staff and
               his roommate were available to care for him. Pullman Fire
               briefed those caring for White and told them to call us back if
               needed. White was lying on his bed when we cleared at about
               1747 hours. No infractions, citations or charges were issued.
               No further investigation. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 14th day of

               1. Ricardo Ladezma-Leon (021493) Warned WAC Violation 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 091314 at approximately 1730 hours, WSU Police
               Intern Matthew Drumheller called requesting an officer respond
               to the alley between Bohler Gym and the Hollingbery Field house
               for a highly intoxicated subject that was stopped by Staff Pro
               security as he entered the football game. Upon arrival, I
               contacted Ricardo Ladezma Leon who was unable to stand on his
               own without nearly falling over. I escorted Ricardo to the side
               of the walkway to remove him from the entrance line. Ricardo
               initially became static resistive and I placed him in a Z
               escort hold and he became more compliant. When we got to the
               side of the alleyway, I asked Ricardo to sit down and he
               complied. I asked him how much he had to drink and he told me a
               medium amount. I asked him who the president of the US was and
               he stated Obama. I asked him where he was and he told me he was
               in Pullman. I asked him for his ID and he fumbled for his
               driver's license for several minutes and finally gave it to me.
               I asked Ricardo if he wanted to go to the hospital and he told
               me he didn't. I asked if he would call a friend to help him get
               home and he just laughed at me. I continued attempting to talk
               to Ricardo and he was responding nonsensically. As I was
               talking to Ricardo, he began vomiting in his lap and all over
               his shirt, wallet, and between his legs. As he began vomiting,
               his brother Donald J. Townslee arrived and told me he has been
               looking for Ricardo. I asked Townslee if he would be willing to
               care for Ricardo for the remainder of the evening and he told
               me he would. I thanked Townslee and he escorted Ricardo from
               the stadium to his residence. I cleared shortly after. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and

               NARRATIVE: On September 13, 2014 at about 1757 hours WSU Police
               Intern Delfino Dominguez requested officers respond to Stadium
               Way and Nevada for an intoxicated male. The intoxicated male
               was described as wearing gray underwear and running. This
               description matched that of Morgan D. White (04/19/96). Officer
               Welter and I had interacted with an intoxicated Morgan D. White
               at Waller Hall just ten (10) minutes prior to this report.
               Intern Dominguez followed White as he ran up Olympia Ave. White
               then ran down a path behind Southside Dining Center. Intern
               Dominguez followed him to Wegner Hall and Gannon Hall. Intern
               Dominguez updated White's location via radio. He was not
               pursuing White, only monitoring his location. Officer Welter
               and I responded to the area. I observed a white male in gray
               underwear running from Gannon Hall. He was trying to cross
               Stadium Way at a marked crosswalk near the Gannon Hall driveway
               access. I immediately recognized the male as Morgan D. White
               (04/19/96). I knew that White was under the age of 21. I also
               knew that he was intoxicated from my previous contact with him
               minutes ago. I stopped my marked patrol vehicle on Stadium Way
               in the curb side lane of traffic. I had on the red, blue,
               white, and yellow emergency warning lights. I exited the
               vehicle, looked at White who was trying to cross Stadium Way
               and yelled "STOP" several times. I was wearing my departmental
               issued WSU Police uniform and hat. My uniform has WSUPD patches
               on the sleeves of both arms. My outer vest carrier has a badge
               and the word "POLICE" across the back and below the badge on
               the left side of my chest. My police hat has the word "POLICE"
               across the front along with the Cougar logo. White did not
               stop. Instead he began to run away from me. He ran north across
               Stadium Way and up towards Neill Hall. Officer Welter was in
               his marked patrol vehicle with the emergency lights on. He had
               pulled up next to my vehicle as White ran away. Officer Welter
               drove north on Stadium Way and turned around at the CUE parking
               garage intersection. I got back in my car and did the same. Due
               to the Stadium Way traffic median we were unable to turn our
               vehicles around at Gannon Hall. I watched Officer Welter exit
               his vehicle near Neill Hall. I continued driving south on
               Stadium Way and exited my vehicle between Waller Hall and Neill

               Hall. I saw White running away from Officer Welter. White was
               running west from Neill Hall towards Waller Hall. I pursued
               White in a running foot chase. Again I yelled "STOP" several
               times. White, barefoot and wearing only underwear, continued to
               run toward the parking lot between Stimson and Waller Halls.
               White ran into the bumper of a parked car, stumbled and fell on
               the sidewalk on the north west corner of Waller Hall. I did not
               make contact with White until he was on the ground. Officer
               Welter and I placed White in handcuffs with his hands behind
               his back. I advised him he was under arrest and had the right
               to an attorney. White remained on the ground. When asked, he
               said he was not injured. I rolled him off of his stomach and
               onto his back to help him breath as he had been running for
               some time. I asked White why he didn't stop for us. In a
               slurred reply White said, "You guys were trying to threaten
               me." White then proceeded to turn his head toward me and spit
               on my left leg just below my knee. We had Pullman Fire respond
               to our location as White had fallen and was found incapacitated
               by alcohol a public place. He was placed under protective
               custody due to the intoxication. Pullman Fire personnel soon
               arrived. Some of them had responded with Officer Welter and I
               just minutes before to White's dorm room. Police and Fire
               personnel placed White on the stretcher. He was lying with his
               back to the bed. I was assisting with buckling the belt on the
               stretcher when White again turned towards me and spit on me.
               There were people standing around the entire stretcher but only
               I was targeted to be spit upon. The spit went on my hat, vest,
               shirt and neck. A spit hood was promptly placed on White. I
               rode in the ambulance with White to Pullman Regional Hospital.
               He was not compliant with medical personnel. Restraints were
               used to protect hospital staff and White. White was delivered
               to Pullman Regional Hospital pursuant to RCW 70.96A.120 in
               protective custody. I filled out a protective custody form. Dr.
               Hval signed it and I have placed a copy in the case file. In
               addition Intern Dominguez was injured in this incident.
               Unbeknown to Officer Welter and I Intern Dominguez tripped on
               the Stadium Way traffic median when we began to purse White on
               foot. Intern Dominguez was attempting to follow after us.
               Intern Dominguez showed up at Waller Hall after we had White
               handcuffed. It was then that I learned of his injuries. He
               injured his left wrist, sternum, and right leg. Intern
               Dominguez went to Pullman Regional Hospital for medical
               treatment. See case 14-W3463. On September 14, 2014 at about
               1407 hours I received a phone call that was transferred to me
               from Whitcom. A male on the phone identified himself as Morgan
               White. He said he didn't remember much about what happened
               yesterday and wanted to apologize. I briefed White on the two
               encounters I had with him and discussed the potential
               consequences that he may face criminally and through the
               university. At the end of the conversation White quietly
               apologized again before ending the telephone call. Charges will
               be forwarded to the Whitman County Prosecutors Office. The
               incident will be referred to WSU Student Standards and
               Accountability. VieVu video of the incident has been
               downloaded. No further investigation. I certify and declare

               On 09/13/14 at about 1804 hrs I was working at the WSU vs PSU
               football game in Martin Stadium. I was standing in the outer
               concourse near section 30 when a female who was walking through
               the concourse caught my attention. The female, later identified
               as Jaylene C. Grinder (042294), caught my attention because she
               appeared to be under the age of 21. She was using her friends
               for balance and stumbling as she walked. I contacted Grinder
               and asked how much she had to drink. She admitted to having had
               a couple beers. Grinder swayed side to side as she stood. I
               asked if I could check her eyes and she said yes. I
               administered a horizontal gaze nystagmus test on her. I
               observed she had bloodshot and watery eyes and a lack of smooth
               pursuit in both eyes. I could smell the odor of intoxicants on
               her breath as I administered the test. I asked Grinder how old
               she was and she said 20. She provided me with her Washington
               Driver's License which confirmed her age. I advised her she was
               under arrest for MIP exhibiting and began escorting her to the
               processing room. As we began walking she pulled out her cell
               phone and either began texting or making a call I was unsure
               which. I asked her to give me her phone and she refused,
               pulling away from me. Deputy Pelissier grabbed on to her other
               arm and took her phone. I placed her in handcuffs (double
               locked) and escorted her to the processing room. I read Grinder
               an ejection warning and provided her with a copy. I advised her
               I would be forwarding charges to the prosecutor's office for
               MIP Exhibiting. I escorted her from the stadium. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under

               14 at approximately 1820 hours, Ofc. Welter and I responded to

               contacted the subject who was identified as Alexander J. Remund
               by his WA Driver's License. He stated he thought he would try
               and eat something to feel better but realized it wasn't
               working. He was able to answer all of our questions. He was
               still intoxicated, but not causing any issues. A worker at the
               Cafe stated he was friends with him and would be willing to
               walk him home and make sure he was okay for the night. We did
               not identify the staff member. Alex had been previously
               contacted for an alcohol offense at Martin Stadium and had been
               ejected. He was cooperative and apologetic. He was left with

               MIP exhibiting and Assault 3rd degree. Subject booked into the
               Whitman County Jail. Incident forwarded to Student Conduct.

               Arrested MIP/Assault 3rd Booked 2. NARRATIVE: On 09/13/14 at
               about 1830 hrs I was working at the WSU vs PSU football game. I
               was in the outer concourse near section 28 when I noticed a
               female, later identified as Jayme N. Hattrup (021794), who was
               walking in the outer concourse toward the foot court area.
               Hattrup caught my attention because she appeared to be under
               the age of 21 and was stumbling side to side as she walked. She
               was using two of her friends for balance as she walked. As she
               walked past my location I could see the top half of a flask
               sticking out of her bra/shirt. I contacted Hattrup and she was
               immediately verbally uncooperative. I was able to smell the
               odor of intoxicants on her breath as I spoke to her and noticed
               she had bloodshot and watery eyes. She would not allow me to
               look at her eyes but denied consuming alcohol. She provided me
               with the flask, which had a very small amout of liquid in the
               bottom and smelled of intoxicants. I told her she was under
               arrest for MIP Exhibiting and advised her she needed to walk
               with me to the processing room. She shook her head no and I
               grabbed her right arm. She attempted to pull away from me and
               Deputy Pelissier grabbed her left arm. I placed Hattrup in
               handcuffs (double locked). I escorted her to the processing
               room. Hattrup was verbally uncooperative, yelling and arguing
               about why she was being arrested the entire time. Upon reaching
               the processing room I took Hattrup out of the handcuffs so she
               could adjust her clothing. I had her sit down on the bench and
               told her not to get up and I would not put her back in the
               handcuffs. I advised her I had a camera and she was being
               recorded. Hattrup got up off the bench several times and one
               time started walking toward me agressively. I placed her in
               handcuffs again and told her to sit on the bench and not to get
               up. She continued to yell calling all of the officers
               "assholes" and "fuckers". Hattrup was yelling at Officer
               Westerman and one of his arrestees as he was trying to get the
               arrestees information. I told her to stop interfering or she
               would be arrested for obstruction as well. Hattrup continued
               yelling and being verbally uncooperative. She tried to get up
               off of the bench several times and Sergeant Chapman as well as
               Sergeant Larsen had to grab her and sit her on the bench again.
               At one point I was holding Hattrup's phone while waiting for a

               transport unit to arrive. She got mad that I was holding her
               phone and yelled at me to put it down. I told her I was holding
               it so I would not forget to give it to the transport officer.
               She interrupted me and continued yelling at me. She got up off
               the bench, came at me, and kicked me in the right shin. I
               restrained her, sitting her back down on the bench. I told her
               she was now going to be under arrest for assault 3rd degree.
               Once the transport unit arrived Deputy Pelissier and I began to
               walk Hattrup out to the patrol car. Hattrup again began kicking
               me in the right shin as she was walking. She kicked me a total
               of 5 times in the shin as we were walking before we restrained
               her feet and got her into the patrol car. Officer Welter
               transported Hattrup to the Pullman Police Department until the
               completion of the football game. After the game was over I
               completed a booking sheet and Deputy Kalin transported Hattrup
               to the Whitman County Jail for booking. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               about 1757 hours WSU Police Intern Delfino Dominguez requested
               officers respond to Stadium Way and Nevada for an intoxicated
               male. The intoxicated male was described as wearing gray
               underwear and running. Intern Dominquez was injured as Officer
               Welter and I were in a foot pursuit with the intoxicated
               subject later identified as Morgan D. White (04/19/96). Intern
               Dominguez wrote: As I began to cross Stadium Way, I lost my
               footing and fell on the road median. My chest took the majority
               of the impact, followed by my knees and hands. After the
               individual had finally been arrested by Officer Jones, I had a
               moment to inspect my injuries, in which I noticed I had bent my
               chest plate, ripped my pants at the knees, and had ripped my
               shirt as well. At this time is when I finally felt the pain of
               the injuries; my right knee had a burning sensation, my left
               wrist hurt to bend, and my chest was in pain. The impact on my
               chest had caused reflex coughs, which only aggravated the
               underlying pain. ***END OF STATEMENT*** At my direction Intern
               Dominguez accompanied me to Pullman Regional Hospital Emergency
               Room. Dr. Hval evaluated and treated Intern Dominguez for a
               possible broken bone in his left wrist, a bruised sternum, and
               an abrasion to the right leg. I photographed the injuries.
               Washington State Labor and Industries paperwork was filled out
               at the hospital. Officer Stewart was notified of the injury. I
               completed the necessary WSU Incident Report forms. No further
               investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury

               approximately 2126 hours I responded to the area of Sloan Hall
               where dispatch stated they were getting a report of a male
               bleeding. While en route the bleeding male, Trevor Darnell
               Snodgrass 06/10/93, called 911 and told them that he was a
               danger to people around him. Snodgrass said he was sitting on a
               curb near Sloan Hall. Upon arrival I found Snodgrass sitting on
               a curb in front of Sloan Hall. Snodgrass was bleeding from his
               right hand and had smeared blood on his shirt and pants.
               Snodgrass appeared to be every emotional and I could see tears
               in his eyes. I asked Snodgrass what happened to his hand.
               Snograss replied, "ummm I think I punched a sign." Snograss
               said he punched a couple of signs down the road. Snodgrass had
               two laceration to the meaty portions of his hand. One was on
               the side of his hand near his pinky finger. The other was above
               his index finger knuckle on top of his hand. Based on my
               training and experiece, I recognized Snodgrass' injuries to be
               consistent with someone who has punched through a glass window.
               About this time Ofc. Petlovany arrived on scene and I asked him
               to look for any broken glass. Snodgrass provided his WADL when
               I asked for it. As I was running Snodgrass he was
               hyperventilating and crying. I asked Snodgrass to take some
               deep breaths so he could calm down. Snodgrass told me that he
               "just didn't want to hurt anybody" so that is why he called
               911. About this time Medics arrived on scene. They evaluated
               Snodgrass' hand and said the cuts were not very deep. The
               medics asked why he punched the sign. Snodgrass said he has
               dependancy issues with Ambien sleep medication and its causing
               him to have weird feelings. Snodgrass continued to say that
               "sometimes I feel the need to hit things so I don't hit other
               people." Snodgrass said he thinks the Ambien is giving him some
               weird side effects and feels like he wants to hurt himself. The
               medics asked if Snodgrass would like to go to the hospital and
               he said yes. The medics assited Snodgrass into the ambulance.
               Ofc. Petlovany walked along Spokane Street but only found a
               newspaper dispenser that may have been punched. Ofc. Petlovany
               said there was no damage to the dispenser. Once Snodgrass was

               loaded into the Ambulance I cleared. About 5 minutes later
               Dispatch stated someone called stating they found broken glass
               and blood inside of Sloan Hall. I returned to Sloan Hall and
               located the glass and blood. After looking at the damage I was
               able to put together what happened with Snodgrass. Snodgrass
               entered Sloan hall via the front doors on the northeast corner
               of the building. Snodgrass entered the hallway walking
               southbound. Snograss first ripped off several papers that were
               on a bulletin board and threw them on the ground. Snodgrass
               contined southbound and reached a fire extinguisher station
               next to room 175. The fire extinguisher box is approximately 2
               1/2 feet across and 4 feet high with a plate glass front.
               Snodgrass punched the glass window of the fire extinguisher box
               causing the glass to break and cutting his right hand. There
               was blood on some of the glass still attached to the box and
               more blood on the floor. There were numerous drops of blood
               that continued southbound through the hallway. A few feet
               further down the hall, Snodgrass found another bulletin board
               and ripped off all the papers again. There again was blood on
               the floor and the papers. Snodgrass continued to walk
               southbound dripping a large amount of blood as he walked.
               Snodgrass entered into the EEME building via the shared hallway
               and exited the northside doors of EEME that exit onto Spokane
               Street. There was a large blood smear hand print on the exit
               door of EEME. I followed the blood trail as it lead out of EEME
               and turned left, heading northbound on Spokane Street. A few
               feet from the doors to EEME the blood trail stopped. I had
               found Snodgrass about 50 feet from where the blood trail
               stopped. Based on time, proximity, and the blood found, it is
               clear that Snodgrass was responsible for the damage to Sloan
               Hall. I took photos of the damage in the hallway including the
               fire extinguisher box. I had dispatch call FacOps and have so
               someone could come clean up the blood and glass. The estimated
               value of damage to replace the glass window is $150 dollars.
               Charges of Malicious Mischief 3rd Degree will be forwarded to
               the Prosecutor. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 15th day of September, 2014, in

               room. I informed him that would be the crime of furnishing a
               location for minors to drink. I gave him his Ferrier warning
               and he allowed me to look through his room. I found a glass
               pipe with residue. I did not find any testable marijuana. He
               also had a glass bong in the room. The paraphernalia law was
               explained to him. I told him he would be referred to Student
               Conduct and I cleared. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 14th day of

               Exhibiting. Charges will be forwarded to the Prosecutor.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Savannah L. Lasher
               08/21/94 Charges Forwarded MIP Exhibiting 2. NARRATIVE: On
               09/13/14 at approximately 2226 hours I was driving eastbound on
               Colorado Street next to the WSU parking Services building when
               I noticed two females near the front doors of parking services.
               One female, later identified as Savannah L. Lasher 08/21/94 was
               bent over at the waist, vomiting. Both Lasher and the other
               female, Clara G. Higginson 09/26/94, appeared to be under the
               age of 21. I passed the two and turned around near Smith Gym.
               When I reached the two they were at the intersection of
               Colorado and D St. Higginson was on Lasher's right side and
               Higginson had her left arm around Lasher's back area as if to
               assist Lasher in walking. Even with Higginson assisting Lasher,
               Lasher was stumbling side to side as they walked. I pulled up
               next to the two and exited my patrol car. I told the two that I
               needed to talk to them. Lasher and Higginson stopped. I told
               Lasher that I had seen her vomiting in the bushes and asked her
               if she was doing ok. Lasher said she was fine. I asked Lasher
               if she just had too much to drink but Lasher did not respond. I
               asked Lasher a series of questions to determine her mental
               status. Lasher was able to answer all my questions correctly.
               Lasher was wearing jeans and a lace top. I noticed that the
               knee area of the jeans were scuffed up and had dirt on them as
               if Lasher had fallen recently. I asked Lasher if she was ok and
               she said she was. I asked Lasher for her information and she
               provided it verbally. Lasher identified herself as 20 years
               old. I asked Lasher how much she had to drink tonight. Lasher
               said she had 4 mixed drinks. I asked Lasher if she mixed the
               drinks herself. Lasher said no, "that's the problem." I asked
               Lasher if I could check her eyes and she I could. During the
               HGN test I observed, equal tracking, lack of smooth pursuit,
               and distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation in
               both eyes. I could smell the odor of intoxicants coming from
               Lasher's breath. Lasher's eyes were watery. About this time
               Sgt. Griffin arrived on scene. I told Lasher that she was being
               charged with MIP Exhibiting and told her to have a seat while I
               ran her name. Lasher sat down and I ran her name through
               dispatch. Sgt. Griffin spoke with Higginson away from Lasher.
               Dispatch stated that Lasher had been arrested for battery in
               Idaho on 08/23/14. Dispatch also informed me that Lasher had
               been arrested for minor consuming alcohol on 10/30/11 on the U

               of MIP Exhibiting to the Prosecutor. I explained the process to
               Lasher and released her to Higginson who did not appear to be
               intoxicated. Charges of MIP Exhibiting will be forwarded to the
               Prosecutor. Lasher does not qualify for the diversion program
               due to her past two arrests. Nothing further. I certify and

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W3477 SYNOPSIS: Report of an overdose at
               Northside Hall room 333. Upon arrival it was determined that
               the cause of the female vomiting was bulimic. The female

               1. Shelby R. English 03/25/96 Contacted 2. NARRATIVE: On
               09/13/14 at approximately 2247 hours I responded to an overdose
               call at Northside Hall room 333. Dispatch stated a female was
               throwing up in room 333 and either fainted or passed out. Upon
               arrival I found RA's at room 333. The RA's pointed me to the
               bed on the right side of the room. The room smelled strongly of
               vomit and alcohol. I contacted the female, Shelby Ray English
               03/25/96, who was laying in bed. I asked English how she was
               doing and she said she was fine. I asked English how much she
               had to drink and she said only one drink. English went on to
               say that the reason she was throwing up was because she's
               bulimic. English stated her roommate, Clara Viola Bedlington
               08/24/95, had found her throwing up and shaking and that's why
               Bedlington went to get an RA. English said she normally shakes
               when she throws up. English said she has had an eating disorder
               for a while now so it was not a big deal to her. Once medics
               arrived I left the room to speak to Bedlington. Bedlington said
               she came home and found English as English had described. I
               asked Bedlington if she had any idea how much English drank
               tonight. English said Bedlington had quite a bit of alcohol
               prior to the football game but did not know how much she drank
               after that. Bedlington stated that she had not seen English
               since they left for the football game. Bedlington said she just
               figured out that English had an eating disorder the previous
               day. Bedlington said she was willing to watch over English if
               she was not taken to the hospital. Medics determined that
               English did not need to go to the hospital and cleared. I told
               Bedlington to call 911 if anything else happened tonight and I
               cleared. This case will be referred to WSU Counseling Services.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 15th day of September, 2014, in

               Security informed me there was a subject attempting to get into

               McMahon (032792), and saw that he was visibly intoxicated. He
               had difficulty standing, labored speech, was breathing through
