    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Olmstead/339 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W3220 SYNOPSIS: Hannah M. Mitchell (DOB
               09-09-1985) reported a bicycle chained to the stairwell near
               the McEachern Hall loading dock. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 09-02-2014 at about 0916 hrs I
               was dispatched to a report of a bicycle chained to the
               stairwell near the McEachern Hall loading dock, located at 1500
               SE Olympia Avenue. I arrived on scene and located the bicycle.
               The bicycle was partially blocking access to the loading dock
               and nearby stairs. I contacted the complainant, Hannah M.
               Mitchell (DOB 09-09-1985), on the telephone. Mitchell is the
               hall director for McEachern Hall. Mitchell said the bicycle has
               been chained to the stairs for the past week. Mitchell was
               concerned because the positioning of the bicycle was partially
               blocking access to the loading dock. Mitchell asked if the
               police department could remove the bicycle. I told Mitchell
               that the police department only takes custody of bicycles if
               there is an exigent situation or if the bicycle is stolen
               property. I told Mitchell that I would leave my business card
               on the bicycle with instructions for the owner to move the
               bicycle, which I did. I suggested that Mitchell contact WSU
               Housing Maintenance and WSU Facilities Operations and inquire
               if they might remove the bicycle. I cleared the scene. No
               further action at this time. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
