               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W3513 SYNOPSIS: Nicholas T. Kayioni (02-
               02-96) came to the WSU Police Department stating someone had
               taken his iPhone 5 from the WSU Compton Union Building on 09-
               15-14. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE:
               Nicholas T. Kayioni (02-02-96) came to the WSU Police
               Department on 09-16-14 stating someone had taken his iPhone 5
               from the WSU Compton Union Building. Kayioni said he was at the
               CUB on 09-15-14 and was sitting in the front row of seats near
               the large scree in the main lobby. He said he took his phone
               out of his pocket and placed it on the seat next to him while
               he was using his lap top. He said he got hungry so he gathered
               up his things and placed them into his backpack. He got up and
               walked over to Panda Express. He said the line was fairly long
               so he reached into his pocket to pull his cell phone out and
               realized it was gone. He walked back to the area he had been
               sitting previously and looked around for his phone. He could
               not find it. He checked with the CUB information desk several
               times on 09-15-14 as well as on 09-16-14 prior to coming to the
               Police Department to see if his phone had been turned in. It
               had not. Kayioni said he has had the iPhone for nearly 2 years.
               He said he received it as a gift from his mother and does not
               know how much she paid for it. He described the phone being
               black in color and having a case which was purple and green. I
               asked him if he had used the phone on the WSU Network and he
               said he had. He said his WSU Network ID is: nicholas.kayioni He
               said he had the app "Find my iPhone" activated on his iPhone.
               He said he has been checking the app constantly since the phone
               went missing and it shows the phone is turned off. I sent
               Kayioni an e-mail asking him to see if he could locate the
               serial number, mac address, and price of the phone when it was
               purchased and send the information back to me. More to follow.
               I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws
               of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 16th day of September, 2014, in Pullman,

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: JAK/333 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W3514 SYNOPSIS: CPS asked me to respond
               to Steptoe Village; apartment M140 to interview the occupants
               regarding a possible "Pre-Trial Conditions of Release" Court
               Order. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               09-16-14, CPS Social Worker, Donnett Neu, asked me to meet her
               at the City of Pullman Police Department. I met Neu and asked
               her what I could do for her. She said CPS had received a
               referral and she wanted an Officer to accompany her to Steptoe
               Village; apartment M140. She needed to interview the resident,
               Whitney Gress. CPS received a referral that Levi Helgerson may
               be staying with Gress in the apartment. Helgerson had a pre-
               trial release order which shows him as staying at 402 S.
               Eastern St; #12 in Spokane Valley. According to the Court
               Order, Helgerson had to get permission by the CCSO to move from
               this address. Helgerson is also restricted to travel in Walla
               Walla, Columbia, and Spokane counties. Another condition of the
               Court Order is Helgerson is not allowed have any contact with
               children who are less than 12 years of age unless supervised by
               a responsible adult. Gress has a 2 year old boy who lives with
               her. I spoke with Columbia County Prosecuting Attorney, Rea
               Culwell, who told me she would like Helgerson taken into
               custody if any of his conditions of release were being
               violated. I called the Whitman County Prosecuting Attorney,
               Dennis Tracy, to insure we had the authority to take someone
               into custody for a violation of a Pre-Trial Court Order. Tracy
               told me we had authority to do so under "Rules for Superior
               Court-Criminal Rules-CrR 3.2. He advised we should use our
               discretion in this case, but did say if Helgerson was arrested
               for a violation of the Court Order he should not be booked into
               the Whitman County Jail. Tracy advised we are to contact the
               Columbia County Sheriff's Office and arrange for a Sheriff's
               Deputy to come take custody of Helgerson. At approximately 1510
               hours, on 09-16-14, Neu and I responded to Steptoe Village and
               knocked on the door to apartment M140. No one came to the door.
               The apartment was dark and I could not see or hear anyone in
               the apartment. I told Neu I would pass the case on to the next
               shift and would ask them to check the apartment several times
               throughout the evening. She asked we call her on her cell
               phone, 509-553-9001, if we were able to make contact with
               Gress. I passed the information on to Corporal Daniels and
               Officer Stewart. Investigation Continues. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W3519 SYNOPSIS: RP reporting threatening
               text messages from her sister. Rp wanted incident documented
               and requested extra patrols. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 09-16-14 at approximately 1545
               hours, I responded to Pullman PD to contact the RP, Ericka
               Christensen, who had been receiving threatening texts from her
               sister. I have previously contacted Ericka for similar reasons.
               Ericka stated her sister, Melinda Christensen, had recently
               stopped taking her medication and had sent some text messages
               that seemed threatening in nature to her and her mother. Ericka
               stated she has been working with her sister to put her on
               disability due to her mental issues. She stated she had been
               named as the Payee for her sister and Melinda had been doing
               well until recently when she stopped taking her medications.
               For her birthday, Ericka had gotten Melinda a SmartTV. Melinda
               became enraged and began sending text messages stating she
               didn't want the tv and felt the gift was superficial. In the
               text string she writes, "Mom is now as Dead n Lost 2 Me as Dad
               and I THINK YOU ARE expendable too". At one point, Ericka sent
               Melinda a pizza and Melinda seems to calm down a little, but
               then states, "I'm so angry n hurt I WANT to metaphorically rip
               MOMs heart out and spit down the cavity She Derserves It no
               EARNED IT. I CAN"T EAT". Melinda also sent her mother a text,
               "Happy FUCK u! YOU EARNED this, D-day You've all ripped Me Open
               so DEEP I FEEL HATE, HATE n pity DEAD TO ME TONIGHT FUNERAL 2
               FOLLOW. Dead Mom." It appears from the screen shot this text
               was sent on August 30th around 8:48 pm. It appears that on 09-
               14-14 at approximately 0257 hours, Melinda posted the following
               on Facebook: "So I suppose if your family purchases one large,
               flat, "smart" TV for your birthday and you exchange that bundle
               of Joy for One feels right MossB pump action 20 gauge...and
               your Combo tags Well, when the Family then make No attempt to
               even Call on your Birthday-- ---Enough said--- Best Exchange of
               My Life." Ericka stated Melinda also posted a video online
               which she shows a decorative plate she had purchased for
               mother's day which she destroys stating that is what she thinks
               of her mother. Ericka reported the incidents to Moscow and
               asked for a welfare check on Melinda as she lives in Moscow and
               they are familiar with her. She stated the Moscow PD officer
               recommended she advise us as she lives in our area. I asked
               Ericka what she wanted done with the case and she stated for
               now she just wanted it documented. She stated she is working on
               having a third party take over as Melinda's Payee. She stated

               she is a little concerned about her property and her son as
               Melinda is aware of where she lives and has been violent in the
               past. They believe Melinda has previously put an axe through
               the hood of her vehicle and shot out her grandparent's windows.
               These incidents did not happen in Pullman. She stated she
               believes Melinda has a 357 handgun and believes she probably
               did trade the tv for a shotgun. We discussed her options,
               including help in relocating and obtaining a restraining order.
               Ericka stated she would think about it, but for now was just
               requesting extra patrols near her apartment. She stated she is
               concerned that if she has Melinda contacted or gets a
               restraining order, that is would only make things worse and
               would make Melinda more volatile. I advised her I would
               document and put out a request to our officers for the extra
               patrols. I asked her to email me screen shots of the texts and
               the video and she stated she would. I later attached them to
               Files. I gave Ericka my business card and told her to call if
               she needed anything further. She stated she would. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.
               Dated this 16th day of September, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               RA's contacted Delaney for violations of the housing agreement.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Delaney Lee Harris
               04/16/96 2. NARRATIVE: On 09/16/14 at approximately 2119 hours
               I responded to Waller Hall where the RED on duty, Charles
               Beckers, was requesting Officers to be present while RA's
               contacted Delaney Lee Harris. Upon arrival at Waller Hall I
               asked the RA's what was going on. The RA's stated that Harris
               has been found climbing the outside of the building to get into
               his second story room. The RA's stated that Harris has been
               acting very odd and are aware of his mental issues. The RA's
               were concerned about contacting Harris because of his recent
               behavior. I went to Harris' room with the RA's and Beckers. I
               stood around the corner in the hallway out of view while the
               RA's spoke with Harris. I was able to over hear Harris'
               conversation and he stated that he had climbed the outside of
               the building because he was locked out of his room. The RA's
               explained that Harris has been told several times he is not
               allowed to go out his window or climb the building. While
               listing to the conversation, I got the feeling that something
               off with Harris. The way Harris would answer questions was odd
               and did not make sense at times. Harris seemed receptive to the
               RA's telling him he could not climb the building. Once the RA's
               were done talking with Harris we all went to the lobby. Beckers
               said Harris had already been to a WSU counselor but did not
               know if he was still going. This case will be referred to
               counseling services for follow up. Nothing further. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.

               (011694) Warned Involvement in possession of marijuana
               NARRATIVE: On 091614 at approximately 2345 hours, I was on a
               foot patrol in the area of the "Magic Forest" behind Orton Hall
               when I noticed four males walking toward the basketball courts
               on the south side of Orton Hall. I saw the four males push
               aside the edge of the fence leading to the basketball courts
               and squeeze through an approximate four foot opening near the
               base of the fence. During a foot patrol I conducted on 090914,
               I knew that basketball court entrances to be locked, and the
               area the subjects entered was not a typical entrance to the
               courts. I observed the subjects standing along one of the walls
               for approximately five (5) minutes and then walk back and
               squeeze back through the opening. I contacted the four subjects
               for trespassing and asked each of them for their
               Identifications. I asked them what they were doing in the
               basketball courts and they told me they were just hanging out.
               I explained that typically when people go into the courts after
               dark, they are there to smoke marijuana. All four subjects
               denied smoking marijuana or being in possession of marijuana.
               They all identified themselves as Joseph D. Lee (011694), Craig
               F. B. Rumbaugh (091694), Cullen D. Salinas Zackuse (090794),
               and Reece G. Vallee (110993). I asked each of them if they
               would be willing to allow me to search their persons and
               everyone but Vallee told me I could. I asked Vallee if he was
               trying to hide something and he told me he wasn't. Vallee
               explained that he has been in trouble with the police in the
               past and that I was making him nervous. He was very visibly
               nervous during the contact. I told all four they were free to
               leave. As Cullen was getting ready to leave, I saw that Cullen
               was the only person in possession of a backpack, so I asked him
               what was in his backpack. He told me he had a box of shoes. I
               asked him if I could see what he had in his backpack and opened

               it. He showed me that there was a Saucony shoe box in his
               backpack and then pointed to the shoes he was wearing. I asked
               him what was in the box and he stated, "Am I allowed to show
               you?" I told him he could show me and he pulled the box out of
               his backpack and opened it. When he pulled out the box, I
               noticed a strong odor of fresh marijuana coming from the box he
               pulled from his backpack. Cullen opened the lid of the box and
               I could see a metal marijuana pipe and a plastic bag containing
               what appeared to be marijuana. Cullen told me he was a medical
               marijuana patient, but that he was not in possession of any
               medical marijuana paperwork or cards identifying him as a
               medicinal marijuana patient. I told him that I already saw the
               marijuana and paraphernalia in the box and stated that I
               intended to just have him destroy everything in the box and I
               would send the case to WSU Student Conduct. I asked him to show
               me what else was in the box and he opened the box and stated he
               had some medicinal Cavi Cone and Medicinal Cavi Gold. I saw a
               black plastic cylinder and asked him what was in it. He stated
               it was "Girl Scout Cookies." I asked him to open the tube and
               he opened it showing me there was a small plastic bag
               containing two pills. I asked him what the pills were and he
               told me he didn't know. They appeared to be similar, based on
               my training and experience, as the street drug called "Molly"
               or MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxy-N-ethylamphetamine). I asked him if
               it was "Molly" and he stated he got it from a friend on
               September 7th, 2014, for his birthday and his friend told him
               it was "Molly." I asked him who gave him the "Molly" and he
               stated he got it from his friend. I asked him what his friend's
               name is and he told him he got it from Reece. I asked him if it
               was the Reece that was with him tonight and he told me it was.
               I asked him if Reece had more "Molly" in his room, and he told
               me he didn't know. I placed Cullen under arrest for possession
               of marijuana. WSUPD Intern Calen Roberts handcuffed Cullen (DL)
               and searched his person incident to arrest. Ofc. Westerman
               transported Cullen to the Pullman Police Department. I returned
               to the WSU Police Department and conducted a Nik test for
               MDMA/Ecstasy, Amphetamines and Meth. I placed a small amount of
               the powder from inside one of the pills into the Nik Test
               pouch. I broke the ampule inside the pouch as instructed on the
               side of the box. I agitated the kit for 12 seconds and noticed
               that the liquid was a brownish color which the test kit
               indicated was presumptive positive for amphetamines or meth. I
               asked Ofc. Westerman if he knew what room Reece lived in and he
               advised that Reece lives in room 931 Orton Hall which was
               confirmed by searching his name in the WSU Housing records. I
               asked dispatch to run a criminal history on Reece, which
               indicated he has several arrests in his record. The criminal
               history also indicated that Reece has two aliases which were
               Reece Gabriel Vallee-Curd, and Reece Gariel Vallee-Curd. All
               aliases had the same birth date of 11/09/1993. I applied for a
               search warrant to search Reece's room for additional "Molly"
               and Judge Frazier denied the warrant based on a lack of
               probable cause to tie Reece's room to the possession of the
               drug. I returned to Pullman Police Department and released
               Cullen. I explained to him that I was going to process all the

               pills sent to the Washington State Crime Lab for testing. I
               told him that if the crime lab returned with a positive test
               for a controlled substance, that I would be forwarding charges
               to the Whitman County Prosecutor for possession of a controlled
               substance and possession of marijuana less than 40 grams. I
               explained that I was also going to be forwarding charges on
               Reece if the crime lab results were positive for delivery of a
               controlled substance. Cullen told me he understood and he was
               released from PPD holding facility. More to follow. Case

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W3528 SYNOPSIS: FacOps reporting an
               audible alarm going off behind Cooper Publications. The alarm
               was found to be coming from a USDA building in the northwest
               corner of the Cooper Publications parking lot. Upon arrival the
               alarm had turned off. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               2. NARRATIVE: On 09/17/14 at approximately 0112 hours, I was
               dispatched to an alarm call in the area of Cooper Publications.
               FacOps was reporting an audible alarm coming from a building
               behind Cooper Publications. Upon arrival I searched the area
               but could not hear an alarm. While driving around trying to
               find the alarm, I located a FacOps employee. He drove me to the
               spot where the alarm had been going off. The employee pointed
               to the small USDA building in the northwest corner of the
               Cooper Publications parking lot. The building was labeled with
               two different numbers, 109 and 139. The employee said the
               exterior alarm sporadically goes off. Due to the building be
               owned by USDA I did not have a way to enter the building. Since
               the alarm had turned itself off I cleared. Nothing further. I
