               DEPARTMENT CASE #:14-W3364 SYNOPSIS: Request for an extra
               patrol of class. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 09/10/14 at approximately 0845 hours WSUPD was
               dispatched for an extra patrol at Fulmer Hall room 226 at
               approximately 1000 hours. The reporting party was the Office of
               Equal Opportunity/Center for Human Rights (Kim Anderson). The
               extra patrol request was in reference to case 14-W3329 which
               was a violation of a protection order. The violation occurred
               when the petitioner saw the respondent in class on 09/05/14.
               The extra patrol was requested incase the respondent appeared
               in class again today. I called the respondent, Carl Tiburcio at
               approximately 0900 hours. I asked Tiburcio if he was able to
               get his class schedule changed and he said he dropped the class
               (Chemistry 101). I reminded Tiburcio that if he showed up in
               class today, it would be a violation of the order and he said
               he understood that. I called Anderson and told her about my
               conversation with Tiburcio. Anderson said the petitioner, Bryla
               Jones, was not aware that Tiburcio dropped the class. Anderson
               said she would call Jones and advise her. I told Anderson I
               would notify Sgt. Macy of the request for the extra patrol.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 10th day of September, 2014, in
               Pullman, Washington. _______________________________________

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC:MTK/336 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #:14-W3365 SYNOPSIS: Report of a possible
               trespass at the IT building. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Adam Ratliff 06/04/82 2. NARRATIVE: On 09/10/14
               at approximately 0915 hours I was dispatched to a trespassing
               call. I contacted the reporting party, Danielle Hess (WSU
               Attorney General's Office) and asked how I could help. Hess
               explained to me that Kathy Barnard (Executive Director of
               University Communications) needed contact reference a possible
               trespassing that occurred between 1700 hours and 2300 hours on
               09/09/14. I went to French Administration building room 446M
               and met with Kathy Barnard and several other administrators.
               Barnard explained to me that on 09/09/14 at 0950 hours she met
               with Adam Ratliff to change his work status to home assignment.
               Barnard explained that he was told (verbally and in witting) to
               not go to his office without prior approval from her. Barnard
               explained that Brian Clark (Ratliff's supervisor) received an
               email from Ratliff on 09/09/14 at 2311 hours stating that he
               cleaned out his (Ratliff's) office and put his keys and other
               University property in his mailbox. Barnard said that when the
               University Communications office attempted to retrieve data
               from Ratliff's computer they were unable to do so. Barnard was
               concerned that Ratliff tampered with the data. Barnard
               explained that their IT employee (Guy Ellibe) had Ratliff's
               computer and was waiting for the go ahead to further attempt to
               retrieve the data. Barnard also told me that a shelf belonging
               to WSU was also missing from Ratliff's office. I explained to
               Barnard that I would check the video surveillance from the IT
               building to determine when Ratliff was in the building as well
               as see if anyone else was with him. I told Ellibe that he could
               go ahead with his data retrieval to determine if any additional
               crimes could have been committed (malicious mischief or
               computer trespass). I suggested that Barnard meet with Hess to
               create an enforceable trespass order (since the form that was
               provided to Ratliff was not enforceable as it was written). I
               provided all subjects in the meeting with my business card, the
               case number, and my contact information. I returned to WSUPD
               and checked the surveillance video of the IT building. At 1950
               hours on 09/09/10 three subjects enter the IT building from the
               south doors off of NE Wilson Rd. Between 1950 hours and 2126
               hours the three subjects are seen removing items from the
               building from the same doors they entered as well as leaving
               through an exit down the eastern corridor. I saved 34 still
               images of the subjects (I did not save them to the case at this

               time). I contacted Ellibe and he informed me they were able to
               retrieve the documents. I called Barnard and advised her of the
               data retreival as well as finding several images of people
               entering the IT building and removing items. I sent an email to
               Barnard, Hess, and Bonnie Akrom (HRS representative) and
               explained my findings. I told them about the file cabinet being
               removed and said to contact me for any further assistance
               needed. At this time the case appears to be an administrative
               function unless the file cabinet is not returned. Investigation
               continues. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 10th day of September, 2014, in

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W3370 SYNOPSIS: Remond Police Dept.
               called concerning the welfare of a student. NARRATIVE: Officer
               Cassidy of the Redmond Washington Police Department called
               concerning the welfare of WSU student Eli Volynski. Talking
               with Officer Cassidy on the phone I learned the following.
               Officer Cassidy talked with Eli's father, Viadimir, earlier
               this date, 9/10/14, concerning a divorce situation concerning
               Eli's parents. During the conversation Viadimir told Cassidy
               that Eli's girl friend (was not identified), who also attends
               WSU, told him that Eli had made a suicidal comment about two
               weeks ago. Viadimir said the girl friend had received a text
               from Eli stating "come to the 12th floor of Stephenson and
               watch me jump". Officer Cassidy said Viadimir did not seem to
               concern about the comment made by his son. Cassidy also said he
               was told Eli's parents had not been in contact with him in the
               last two weeks. Jena Doolittle, Hall Director, Rogers Hall, was
               contacted and informed of the situation. Jena said she became
               aware of the situation about a week ago when approached by the
               girl friend. The girl friend told Jena that Eli starts making
               such comments when she talks about breaking up with him. Jena
               said she had talked with Eli, and was told his girl friend
               tends to exaggerate sometimes. Jena told me she had contacted
               Counseling Services and they were going to follow up with Eli.
               Nothing further at this time. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this ____ day of

               report of a two car non injury collision in the Rotunda parking
               lot. Upon my arrival I contacted Camber A Steveson (053090) who
               told me the following. Stevenson explained she had been backing
               a delivery van (Wa. 21265E) into the loading dock of the
               Rotunda when she struck the passenger side rear bumper of an
               unoccupied vehicle (Wa. 24733E) in the drivers side rear corner
               of the bumper. Steveson contacted her supervisor and reported
               the incident to Whitcom. I looked at the vehicles and
               photographed the damage to both, which were later downloaded to
               this case upon my return to the WSU Police Department. We spoke
               about completing the necessary collision paperwork for the
               university before I provided her with my business card and case
               number for her report. I told her to give me a call and cleared
               a short time later. Nothing further. I certify and declare

               Dispatch advised of hall staff at Streit Hall reporting the
               odor of marijuana coming from room 622. Officer Welter and I
               responded. Upon arriving at the room I could smell a faint odor
               of marijuana coming from the room. I knocked on the door and a
               male, later identified as Devin T. Hamilton (032796), answered
               the door. As soon as the door opened a very strong odor of
               burnt marijuana came from the room. I noticed Hamilton appeared
               to be under the influence of marijuana. His eyes were bloodshot
               and his eyelids were very droopy. I told Hamilton we were there
               because of the odor of marijuana coming from his room. Hamilton
               chuckled and admitted he had been smoking marijuana in his
               room. I noticed several other people in the room and directed
               them all to come outside and sit in the hallway. The subjects
               were later identified as Tyler P. Shuey (112595), Adrian I.
               Morales (030396), Cheyenne G. Singsanavong (102795), and Ana R.
               Ramirez-Zurita (022896). Hamilton provided me with his driver's
               license and medical marijuana paperwork. He told me he was the
               only one smoking and all the marijuana in the room was his. It
               appeared Shuey and Morales had also been smoking marijuana.
               They denied smoking but allowed me to look at their eyes. I
               observed they both had bloodshot and watery eyes with a lack of
               convergence. I told Shuey and Morales I did not believe them
               and thought they had been smoking marijuana also. They
               continued to deny smoking marijuana. I warned Hamilton for
               smoking in his room and instructed him he was not allowed to
               have his marijuana in his room or to smoke marijuana in his
               room. I also warned him that if he were providing marijuana to
               his friends he could be arrested. Hamilton collected his
               marijuana and smoking devices from the room. I walked with
               Hamilton out to a friends vehicle to store his items. Hamilton
               was polite and cooperative throughout the contact. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 11 day of September, 2014, in Pullman,

               she recognized as Paul T. Hinton. I never contacted Hinton as
               he was gone when I arrived. I smelled the crack of the door and
               could smell the odor of marijuana emitting from the room. I
               knocked on the door and a male, later identified as Michael
               Beauchamp by his WA Driver's License, answered the door. The
               other occupant of the room, was later identified as Jann Zeta
               by his WA Driver's License. Michael began rambling and I didn't
               understand what he was saying, but it was clear he knew why I
               was contacting him. I asked him if he was a medical marijuana
               patient and he said no. He told me he had been contacted last
               night and the odor was left over from then. I observed the
               window was wide open and strong breeze was blowing through the
               room. I told him what I smelled was not from last night and he
               continued to deny any marijuana being in the room. I asked him
               for his ID and he provided it. Ofc. Boyd who was with me told
               him he could see a grinder on the desk. I asked him to get it
               and he did. The grinder had marijuana residue in it. I asked
               him if there was anything else and he said no. I asked him if I
               could come in and look around and he said, "sure." I entered
               the room and on the desk which was Michael's, I could see an
               unlabeled prescription pill bottle containing half of a pill. I
               could see it was orange and had the number 973 stamped into it.
               Based on my training and experience it appeared to me to be a
               ADHD type of medication. I asked him what it was and he
               confirmed it was Adderall. I asked if he had a prescription for
               Adderall and he said no. I gave him a warning for Possession of
               a Schedule II Controlled Substance. I continued to look around
               and in the top desk drawer was a plastic bag containing
               approximately 50 1x1 zip lock bags with various markings on
               them. Based on my training and experience these type of bags
               are commonly used for marijuana distribution. Michael stated a

               friend had found them and given them to him. I asked him which
               closet was his and he pointed to the one on the west side of
               the room. I looked in the closet and found a backpack which
               contained a bong that had a strong odor of burned marijuana
               emitting from it. I asked him about it and he confirmed it was
               a bong, but stated he had not used it to smoke marijuana. I
               issued both of them a warning for the odor of marijuana and
               items found in the room. I escorted Michael down to the
               dumpster where he disposed of all the items. I cleared. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 11th day of September, 2014, in Pullman,

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: dd/329 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W3383 SYNOPSIS: Report of a female burned
               by a cell phone which burned up on her pillow while she was
               asleep. She was not transported. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 09-11-14 at approximately 0116
               hours, Ofc. Welter and I responded to a medical call for a burn
               at Northside Residence Hall. When we arrived, we found the
               room, 257, had a heavy haze of smoke in it. The female who had
               burned was sitting in the hallway with her roommate. I asked if
               she was okay and she showed me her right index finger which I
               could see had a burned mark on the tip of it. I went into the
               room and unplugged the cell phone which was still plugged into
               an extension cord. The phone was on a pillow on top of the bed
               and I could see it was melted and there was black scorch marks
               on the pillow. There were no flames when I arrived. I asked the
               residents what happened and they stated they were both asleep
               and woke up coughing. They originally thought the fire was in
               the hallway and then quickly realized the smoke was coming from
               the pillow. They exited the room. The smoke detector never
               sounded in the room. The female who was burned was identified
               as Lindee R. Weickmann. Her roommate was identified as Amanda
               M. Kopp. While waiting for Pullman Fire to arrive, I took
               photographs of the pillow, phone, and room. I continued to
               watch the pillow to make sure it was not still smoldering.
               Pullman Fire arrived and accessed Lindee's finger. They
               provided her an ice pack and determined it was a minor burn.
               They looked at the pillow and agreed the amount of smoke should
               have activated the smoke detector. I will request dayshift
               follow up with WSU Life Safety to check the smoke detector. The
               pillow was removed from the bed and the phone was melted to it.
               It was still hot to the touch, but was cooling. I asked Lindee
               if the charging cord was the cord which came with the phone and
               she said no. The phone was a Galaxy 3 phone. Hall staff were on
               scene and it was suggested the females stay in another room for
               the night due to the odor of burned plastic. The window was
               opened to help with ventilation. Pullman Fire stated we could
               clear and we did. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 11th day of
               September, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.
