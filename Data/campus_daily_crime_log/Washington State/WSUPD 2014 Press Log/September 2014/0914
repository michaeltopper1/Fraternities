               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W3485 09/14/14 SYNOPSIS: Dumpster fire in
               the yellow RV lot across from the baseball field. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On September 14,
               2014 at about 0735 hours Pullman Fire and WSU Police were
               dispatched to a dumpster fire in the RV parking lot across from
               the baseball field. I responded to the area. Upon my arrival I
               found a green 5 yard dumptser with smoke showing. One of the
               plastic lids was open. I could see light smoke coming from
               inside the dumpster. There was no flame. The dumpster was only
               about a quarter full of debris. I could see dust and coals from
               a campfire inside the dumpster. Somebody dumped their ashes
               inside the dumpster. There was no "HOT ASH" barrel. Usually
               there are ash barrels located at the dumpsters to prevent this
               type of incident. Pullman Fire extinguished the coals. There
               was no damage to the dumpster. I notified WSU Facilities
               Operations about the incident. This was an accidental fire.
               There are no suspects, witnesses, or leads at this time. No
               further investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 14th day of
               September, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W3489 SYNOPSIS: Wildland Fire caused by a
               transformer on power pole sparking. A small section of hillside
               caught fire and was put out by near by residents. NAME/DOB

               approximately 0048 hours, Sgt. Jacobson and I responded to a
               report of a wildland fire near the Chinook Village apartments.
               Sgt. Jacobson located the fire behind the P building on the
               south side of Forest Way. When I arrived on scene there were
               several people standing near a power pole holding fire
               extinguishers. There were no flames visible when I arrived. I
               walked up to the group standing near the pole who were talking
               to Sgt. Jacobson. I overheard the group say that they heard a
               loud boom noise from over the hill toward the WilRu apartments
               and then saw the hillside catch fire. Several people grabbed
               fire extinguishers from their apartments and ran over to the
               fire and were able to put the small fire out. Sgt. Jacobson had
               the witnesses write their names down on a piece of paper for
               documentation. The witnesses are: -Jesse Daniel Chisholm
               02/02/94 -Ben Windishar-Tatham 12/30/93 -Tipton Hayes 02/24/82

               David Shun-Ming Hsu 11/16/90 -Shane Michael Wilhelm 11/17/92
               Once the fire department arrived they doused the area with
               water. I remained on scene till Avista arrived and I cleared.
               Sgt. Jacobson cleared a short time after that. Nothing further.
               I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws
               of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 15th day of September, 2014, in Pullman,
