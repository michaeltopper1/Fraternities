               substance covering roof and windshield of vehicle. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On September 19,
               2014 at about 0900 hours I discovered an unknown brown
               substance covering the roof and windshield of WSU Police
               Department vehicle #17. Due to several football television semi
               trailers blocking the vehicle bays the police vehicles were
               forced to park out in front of the police department across
               from the CUB. Normally the vehicles are parked inside the
               vehicle bays and protected when not in use. An unknown brown
               substance similar to chocolate ice cream or a mocha coffee was
               on the roof near the front of the vehicle. The substance was on
               the windshield and had collected on the plastic faring below
               the windshield wipers. The substance appeared to be tacky but
               near dry. It is unknown when the substance was applied to the
               vehicle or by who. I last saw the vehicle without the substance
               yesterday, September 18, 2014 at 1600 hours. There was no
               report from Swing Shift or Graveyard about the substance. I
               used a pressure washer to clean the vehicle. There did not
               appear to be any actual damage. Digital photos were taken.
               There are no witness or leads at this time. No further
               investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 19th day of September, 2014, in

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W3574 SYNOPSIS: George M. Malcolm (DOB
               06-06-1945) reported ongoing suspicious activity in the
               Veterinary Teaching Hospital. The toilets in a men's restroom
               have been repeatedly plugged. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 09-19-2014 at about 1039 hrs I
               was dispatched to a report of suspicious activity in the
               Veterinary Teaching Hospital, located at 200 SE Ott Road. I
               arrived on scene and contacted the complainant, George M.
               Malcolm (DOB 06-06-1945). Malcolm is the director of the
               business office for the College of Veterinary Medicine. Also on
               scene was Harmon A. Rogers (DOB 11-24-1951). Rogers is an
               associate professor for Veterinary Clinical Sciences. Malcolm
               told me that over the past three to four weeks someone has been
               plugging the toilets in one particular men's restroom located
               in the teaching hospital. I accompanied Malcolm and Rogers to
               the restroom, which was located on the 1st floor, directly
               across the hallway from the Clinical Pathology Laboratory. We
               contacted two custodial staff members near the restroom, and
               they advised that the toilets have been plugged in the men's
               restroom almost on a daily basis for the past month. The
               custodians have placed notes in the restroom stalls requesting
               that the behavior stop, but it has continued. Sometimes both
               toilets in the restroom are plugged and other times just one.
               The most recent incident was discovered at about 0900 hrs this
               morning, when only one of the toilets was plugged. The
               custodians stated that in many of the incidents toilet tissue
               and paper towels from the sink have been wadded up and stuffed
               into the toilets. The custodians have also discovered that in
               some of the incidents, someone has defecated either above or
               below the blockage. The custodians advised that on 09-17-2014
               both toilets were plugged and someone had defecated in the
               urinal. The custodians could not determine how many total
               incidents they have responded to and could not estimate what
               time of day the toilets have been plugged or any particular day
               of the week when it is most likely to occur. The custodians
               said that no property has been damaged as a result of the
               plugged toilets. The custodians advised that WSU Facilities
               Operations Dispatch might have a record of most of the
               incidents. Because of the shifts the custodians work, confusion
               on their part, and lack of consistent reporting of the
               incidents, it was difficult to establish when the majority of
               the incidents have occurred. I talked to the custodians about
               keeping track of any future incidents. Malcolm showed me that

               the restroom had two separate entrance doors. The restroom can
               be accessed through a door in the hallway across from the
               Clinical Pathology Laboratory or from another door inside the
               bathroom that connects to the surgeon's locker room. Malcolm
               told me that this morning they found the door leading to the
               surgeon's locker room was locked. Even though the key needed to
               lock this door is common and is issued to numerous personnel
               inside the building, it was strange to discover this door
               locked. Rogers advised that a video surveillance camera is
               located on the ceiling in the hallway outside the restroom
               door. However, Rogers checked the video surveillance footage
               and determined that the camera is positioned too far away to
               clearly show individuals entering and/or exiting the restroom
               from the hallway. Rogers mentioned that the teaching hospital
               might consider improving the quality / resolution of the video
               camera at that location or installing another camera closer to
               the restroom entrance. I told Malcolm and Rogers that I would
               visit WSU Facilities Operations Dispatch and would obtain any
               records they could provide showing when the toilets had been
               plugged. I told them that I would furnish this information to
               them and discuss potential ideas to stop the incidents from
               continuing. I cleared the scene and responded to WSU Facilities
               Operations Dispatch. The dispatcher provided me with copies of
               service records for the Veterinary Teaching Hospital and
               highlighted all of the plugged toilet incidents from the men's
               restroom. The dispatcher advised that not all of the plugged
               toilet incidents would be reflected in the service records
               because the incidents were so frequent that some of custodians
               left the service tickets open. The list provided the date when
               the plugged toilet was reported to custodial staff, but no time
               frame was available to determine specifically when the toilet
               might have been plugged. The past incidents were identified as:
               Friday 07-25-2014 Monday 08-04-2014 Wednesday 08-06-2014
               Thursday 08-07-2014 Friday 08-08-2014 Friday 08-15-2014 Tuesday
               08-26-2014 Tuesday 09-09-2014 Wednesday 09-17-2014 Friday 09-
               19-2014 Based on the information in this report, it is
               estimated that the plugged toilet incidents have been occurring
               from 0000 hrs on 07-25-2014 to 0900 hrs on 09-19-2014. Other
               than four of the incidents being reported on Fridays, and some
               noticeable prolonged breaks between a sequence of incidents, I
               was not able to identify a specific pattern to predict when
               they would most likely occur. The service records were scanned
               into Spillman and attached to this case. Investigation
               continues. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this __20__ day of

               21-1994) reported that a plaque was stolen from her residence
               hall door, and an offensive statement was written on her dry
               erase board. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 09-19-2014 at about 1450 hrs I was dispatched to
               a report of a theft at Stevens Hall, located at 600 NE Veterans
               Way. I contacted the victim, Alexa L. Werner (DOB 10-21-1994),
               on the telephone. Werner stated that she had written a bible
               passage on her dry erase board which was hanging from her
               residence hall door, Stevens Hall #211. Werner said the bible
               passage was about the "attributes of love". Werner said she
               also hung a small plaque from the peephole on her door. Werner
               said someone erased the bible passage and wrote the statement,
               "religion is bullshit" on her dry erase board. Werner told me
               that the plaque was missing from her door and had been stolen.
               Werner estimated that the offensive statement was written on
               the dry erase board and her plaque was stolen sometime between
               2100 hrs on 09-18-2014 and 0700 hrs on 09-19-2014. Werner said
               she felt "hurt" by the statement that was written on her dry
               erase board. Werner explained that she didn't understand "that
               level of hate". Werner described the stolen plaque as: wooden,
               black in color with gold and silver lettering, 2 inches wide
               and 5 inches long, and with "Jeremiah 29.11" printed on the
               front. Werner estimated the value of the plaque as $2.00.
               Werner's resident advisor, Alexandra C. Gogel (DOB 04-10-1994),
               forwarded me a photograph of the dry erase board. The
               photograph has been downloaded into Spillman. No suspects or
               leads were identified. I request that this case be forwarded to
               the Office for Equal Opportunity. No further action at this
               time. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the

               He had parked in the upper lot of the SRC approximately 8-10

               Exhibiting 2. NARRATIVE: On 09/19/14 at about 2306 hrs I was
               driving eastbound on Cougar Way St. near the lower soccer field
               when I noticed three subjects who were walking eastbound along
               Cougar Way. They caught my attention because one of them, later
               identified as Brooklynn C. Anderl, was having difficulty
               walking, staggering side to side. As I passed them I could see
               Anderl appeared to be under the age of 21. I contacted Anderl
               as they were entering the Regents parking lot. I asked if I
               could talk to them and they stopped. I asked where they were
               going and Anderl said Northside Hall. I told her the reason I
               wanted to speak with them was because she appeared to be
               intoxicated and was having difficulty walking. I did not ID
               Anderl's friends as they did not appear to be intoxicated. I
               asked Anderl how much she had to drink and she admitted to
               having had several beers. I asked if I could check her eyes to
               see how much she had to drink and she agreed. I administered a
               horizontal gaze nystagmus test on her and observed she had a
               lack of smooth pursuit and a distinct and sustained nystagmus
               at maximum deviation in both eyes. I could smell the odor of
               intoxicants on her breath as I administered the test and had to
               remind her not to move her head during the test. I asked Anderl
               if she had her ID with her and she said she did not. I asked
               how old she was and she said 18. She provided me with her name
               and date of birth. I asked Anderl if she would submit to a
               breath test and she refused. I advised Anderl she was under
               arrest for MIP exhibiting. I placed her in handcuffs (double
               locked) and advised her of her right to remain silent and her
               right to an attorney. I placed her in the back of my patrol car
               while I confirmed the information she provided through Dispatch
               and confirmed she had no prior arrests. I advised Anderl I
               would be forwarding charges to the Whitman County Prosecutor
               for MIP Exhibiting and Anderl was released. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of

               began to lean backward and I was afraid he would fall. He
               stumbled and was able to catch himself. As I administered the
               test I could smell the odor of intoxicants on his breath. I
               asked Martin for his ID and he provided me with his driver's
               license, which confirmed he was under the age of 21. I advised
               Martin he was under arrest for MIP Exhibiting and placed him in
               handcuffs (double locked). I advised him of his right to remain
               silent and his right to an attorney. I had Dispatch check and
               confirm Martin had no prior arrests. I advised Martin I would
               be forwarding charges to the prosecutor for MIP exhibiting and
               he was released. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 20 day of

               was taken into custody and released for MIP-Exhibiting.

               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Dario Prudente (112695) Forwarding MIP-
               Exhibiting 2. NARRATIVE: On 092014 at approximately 0100 hours
               I was driving eastbound on Washington St near the Washington
               Building when I observed a male and female that appeared to
               being arguing. They were in the grass near the green parking
               lot adjacent to the Education Addition. I parked my car near
               Owens Science Library and walked toward the two. They were
               later identified as Athaliah K. Mitchell (041595) and Dario
               Prudente (112695). As I got closer to them I could hear their
               raised voices. Mitchell then pulled on Prudente's arm and he
               would not move. He then pulled on her arm and pulled her back
               to him. I walked closer and Prudente saw me and then began
               walking in the direction Mitchell had tried to get him to go.
               As I got closer I could see the Prudente had mud running down
               his back as he was not wearing a shirt. I could smell the odor
               of intoxicants and both subject appeared to be under 21.
               Prudente was unsteady in his walking and his eyes appeared
               watery and bloodshot. I asked Prudente to sit down and he
               complied. I then spoke with Mitchell who said she was just
               trying to get Prudente home. She said he was a friend from high
               school and were not in a relationship. She said he had not
               assaulted her he just refused to keep walking home. I could
               smell the odor of intoxicants on his breath. She was informed
               she was free to go or could stay. I then spoke with Prudente
               who confirmed what Mitchell told me and confirmed she had not
               assaulted him. I had him stand up and asked him if he could zip
               his pants up. I checked his eyes. I had to instruct him several
               times to follow my pen with his eyes only. I was able to
               observe a lack of smooth pursuit and distinct and sustained
               nystagmus in both eyes. He admitted that the situation looked
               "really bad" but that he was not "that drunk". I then placed
               him in custody for MIP-Exhibiting and placed him in handcuffs.
               He was advised of his Miranda rights. Ofc. Boyd had arrived as
               backup and his Intern searched Prudent incident to arrest.
               Prudente was advised we were recording. Ofc. Boyd was
               instructing the Intern on how to search and Prudente continued
               to be tense with Ofc. Boyd. Ofc. Boyd then instructed him to
               sit down. I heard Prudente say "Chinga" and Ofc. Boyd later
               told me he hear him say "Chinga tu madre". On my video only
               "Chinga" can be heard. I asked him what what he meant by it. I

               asked him to tell me what it meant. I explained to him I was
               going to forward charges of MIP-Exhibiting to the Prosecutor. I
               then checked with Mitchell and 2 other female friends to make
               sure they were comfortable walking him home and they were.
               While he was being released he became uncooperative again. He
               then spoke to me in Spainish, instructing me to talk to him and
               not the females. We then debated my poor pronunciation of
               "Chinga". I stated I have family that lives in Mexico so I
               understood what he had said. He then illogically inferred from
               that statement that I said he was from Mexico. He became
               belligerent again but his friend eventually got him to leave.
               As I walked back to my patrol car I could see Prudente yelling
               at cars as he crossed Stadium Way at Nevada. I got in my car
               and headed towards Goldsworthy. Ofc. Boyd was ahead of me and
               had pulled into the Rotunda entrance as Prudente had continued
               yelling at him and others. The 3 females were leaving Prudente.
               I spoke to them briefly. They were very upset with him and had
               had enough of him. They explained he would not go inside. He
               aslo was calling Ofc. Boyd and I racist as he claimed we had
               called him a monkey. They explained "Changa" and not "Chinga"
               was a female monkey. They left and Ofc. Boyd and I observed
               Prudente at the southern end of Goldsworthy Hall. He was just
               standing around. He had been instructed to get inside. I
               requested Sgt. Jacobson respond and he did. I explained him the
               racist accusation and the events leading up to this point.
               Before any action could be taken, Prudente went inside. Sgt.
               Jacobson and I cleared and Ofc. Boyd stayed in the area for
               another call. Forwarding charges of MIP-Exhibiting. Nothing
               follows. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under

               and correct. Dated this 21st day of September, 2014, in

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W3603 SYNOPSIS: Report of a subject who
               was high on acid. Subject threw himself into a window in the
               2nd floor Streit lounge, causing small lacerations/punctures to
               his right arm. Subject was taken into protective custody and
               transported to PRH via ambulance. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE

               misch 2. NARRATIVE: On 09/20/14 at about 0500 hrs Dispatch
               advised of an overdose on the 2nd floor of Streit Hall. As
               Sergeant Jacobson and I were responding they advised the
               subject was agitated and possibly high on acid. We arrived and
               located the subject in the lounge of the 2nd floor in Streit
               Hall. As soon as the door opened and the subject, later
               identified as Kyle M. Golden (071896), turned and jumped into a
               window. The window shattered, cutting Golden's right
               arm/shoulder. He had a series of small cuts/punctures that
               began bleeding. Sergeant Jacobson and I each grabbed on of
               Golden's arms to place him in handcuffs so he would not injure
               himself further. Golden resisted, tensing up his arms. He was
               yelling about how we were going to "fuck him up". We took
               Golden to the ground and placed him in handcuffs (double
               locked). Initially I told Golden he was going to be under
               arrest for malicious mischief as well as in protective custody.
               Later I determined, because of his state of mind, I would only
               place Golden in protective custody. As we were waiting for
               ambulance personnel to arrive Golden continued talking very
               quickly about his friends, being on "molly", and how we "fucked
               him up" or "could fuck him up". It was clear Golden was on some
               sort of stimulant, his body temperature was elevated and he was
               very agitated. We assisted with getting Golden on to the cot
               and I rode in the ambulance to the hospital to make sure he did
               not become violent with the medical personnel. Sergeant
               Jacobson stayed on scene and spoke with the witnesses. Golden
               was placed in restraints at the hospital and I completed the
               adult protective custody paper work. Nothing further. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.
               Dated this 21 day of September, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W3604 09/20/14 SYNOPSIS: Graffiti on the
               wall 2nd floor of Perham. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR#
               1. 2. NARRATIVE: On September 20, 2014 at about 0603 hours I
               was dispatched to a harassment report at Perham Hall. I
               responded to Perham Hall. I located graffiti on the hallway
               wall of the 2nd floor of Perham. The white wall had the
               following written on it in large letter about a foot tall "KKK
               nigga". The lettering was very faint and hard to see. It
               appeared that someone may have used a black marker, perhaps a
               white board dry erase marker. The graffiti was located between
               rooms 222 and 224. The restroom is directly across the hall and
               there are no rooms in that area. I spoke with a male RA who
               lives on the floor. He said the graffiti happened between 0210
               hours and 0430 hours, today, September 20, 2014. He said the
               writing is faint because they have already cleaned the wall to
               remove most of the markings. I was also told that room 224 is
               empty and there are two white males living in room 222. It is
               unknown who the message was directed at on the floor. I
               photographed the wall. Damage to the wall is estimated at
               $25.00. There are no witnesses, suspects or leads at this time.
               No further investigation. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 20th day of
               September, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.
