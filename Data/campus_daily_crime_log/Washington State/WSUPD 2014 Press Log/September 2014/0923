               report a vehicle parked too close to her in WSU Lot #1 and a
               small "door ding" potentially created by the rear driver's side
               door of the vehicle that parked too close. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 092314 at about
               1210hrs, I responded to a complaint of a non-injury accident in
               WSU Parking lot 1. I located the complainant, Courtney Sanders
               who wanted to report a vehicle parked too close to her vehicle
               in WSU Lot #1 and a small "door ding" potentially created by
               the rear driver's side door of the vehicle that parked too
               close. The vehicle that was parked next to her vehicle was a
               blue 2006 Ford 500 four door. I looked at the small "door ding"
               and it looked like there was a small amount of paint transfer
               of the same color of the vehicle that was parked next to her.
               The underside of the lip of the rear driver's side door looked
               like it may have had a slight scuff mark on it. It was hard to
               tell without being able to open the door. The Ford 500 was
               parked between the parking strips yellow lines but very close
               to the east line. Courtney's vehicle was legally parked as well
               and she was close to the same line but not as close as the Ford
               500. Courtney was backed into her slip while the Ford 500 was
               pulled forward. I indicated to Courtney that I would call the
               owner of the vehicle and talk to them about exited their
               vehicle and to be more careful, but that this was a civil
               situation and not a criminal situation. Several photos were
               taken of the ding and the placement of each vehicle. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: MFL/313 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W3698 SYNOPSIS: Received a third party
               report from an instructor of a student who indicates that he is
               being harassed by another student. The victim student had
               reported the harassment to the Pullman Police Department on
               092214. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 092314 at about 1545hrs, I called the Associate Chair of the
               WSU Mathematics Department, Sandy Cooper. She wanted to report
               a situation involving two math students in a Math 103 class.
               She indicated that a math instructor, Julie Bean had received
               an email from someone named Dom Fossedal that referenced one of
               her students named Mason Cloud. The email is as follows: ------
               ---------------------------------------------------------------
               From: Dom Fossedal <keepwsusafe@aol.com> Sent: Saturday,
               September 20, 2014 11:44 AM To: Bean, Julie Cc: Cloud, Mason
               Michael James Subject: Pillar Of The Community Mason Cloud The
               real life of your dirt bag student Mason Cloud TOM FOSSEDAL- a
               WSU football player lured someone out of their apartment and
               called MASON CLOUD to rob the house of 2 pounds of marijuana
               while the person who got robbed was with him. Mason is driving
               his lowered down silver integra without his registration and
               his license plate number is ADR4245. Mason Cloud robbed someone
               prior of a pound of marijuana who considered him a friend.
               Watch out for these guys. Mason Cloud is still driving his car
               around. Both of them and the crew they roll with are from
               Mukilteo,WA. Mason and Tom both graduated from Kamiak High
               School in Mukilteo,WA Tom Fossedal(pictured top) 425-218-9771

               Pullman,WA 99163 ----------------------------------------------
               ----------------------- The email had two pictures attached,
               one of Tom Fossedal and one of Mason Cloud. The above email was
               sent on Saturday, September 20. Cloud contacted Bean on Monday
               and was extremely upset telling her that the content of the
               email was not true. Bean recommended that Cloud go report the
               situation to the police department. Cloud contact the Pullman
               Police Department at about 1245hrs on 092214. Cloud seems to
               think that the email is written by a student named Michael
               Alfredson and not someone named Dom Fossedal. The email
               insuates that Cloud was involved in a burglary of an apartment
               and allegedly stole some marijuana. The email also suggests
               that he is driving around with an unregistered vehicle.
               According to the Pullman Police case report (14-P08396) Cloud
               indicates that he used to live in the Grove Apartments next to

               someone named Michael Alfredson (Alfredson is in the Math 103
               class with Cloud). Cloud says that Alfredson has accused him of
               breaking into his (Alfredson's) apartment and stealing 2 pound
               of marijuana. Cloud denies this but says Alfredson has harassed
               him with emails and supposedly has threatened him. Although I
               have not seen any emails with a threat. Officer Breshears of
               the Pullman Police Department is investigating the harassment.
               Cloud and Alfredson live in Pullman PD's jurisdiction. I
               mentioned to the instructor that she should work with the Dean
               Of Students to try and get one of the students switched out of
               the math section. MFL/313 I certify and declare under penalty

               hours I was dispatched to a report of a group people writing on
               buildings and sidewalks in the mall area. It was the Sig Eps
               showing support to the Kappa Delta house. The writing was in

               Mall area. I arrived and saw numerous chalk writings on the
               sidewalk and retaining walls. The writings were messages from

               15 males, whom I did not identify but said they were Sig Eps,
               admitted to writing the messages. I asked if they would clean
               up the writings and the mall and they asked why. I told it
               needed to be cleaned up due to the volume of writing and they
               could clean it up or facilities services could clean but
               facilities would charge them. They agreed to go clean up the
               writings. They asked for and I gave them permission to drive a
               vehicle with water and brushes on the mall to help with the
               clean up. nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
