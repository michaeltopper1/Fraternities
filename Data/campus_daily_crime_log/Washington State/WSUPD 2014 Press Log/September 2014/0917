               0716 hours I was dispatched to a found property report at the
               WSU Police Department. I contacted James R. Sharp (02/02/65) at
               the police department. He works for WSU Facilities Operations
               and found the purse as he drove on Veteran's Way near Morrill
               Hall. The black purse contained a Slovakian passport and other
               identification for Karin Pernat (11/04/92). The contents of the
               purse looked undisturbed. There was no contact information in

               morning I spoke with WSUPD front office personnel. Pernat had
               called about her purse. I called her back and arranged to
               return it. I returned it to her in front of Morrill Hall at
               about 0836 hours. She said everything was in the purse. It fell
               out of her car as she was dropping someone off. No further
               investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing

               alarm activation at Greenhouse 109. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On September 17, 2014 at about
               0953 hours Pullman Fire and WSU Police were dispatched to an
               audible alarm at Greenhouse 109. I responded to the building,
               there was no alarm sounding at that time. The actual address is
               2245 NE Wilson Rd. The building was locked with a note that
               said "Gone Fishing Sept 17". Whitcom did not have premise
               contact information for this facility. The Knox box is empty. I
               contacted Julie R. Thayer (07/28/77) who has an office in the
               trailer next door. She told me Dave Stout is the only person
               responsible for the building. She provided me with his office
               number and email. Thayer walked over to the building with me.
               She said everything looked normal from the outside looking in.
               She does not have the code or access to the alarm. Thayer told
               me the lower portion of the building is referred to as the
               "Seed Storage" and the upper part is Greenhouse 109. When I
               returned to the station I found a home telephone and cell phone
               number for Stout. I called both numbers, nobody answered and I
               was unable to leave a message at either number. I will email
               Stout a new premise contact form. No further investigation. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 17th day of September, 2014, in Pullman,

               were on the west side of Stadium Way at the intersection of
               Ferdinand Lane waiting to cross Stadium Way. There were three
               or four vehicles in the south bound lanes of Stadium Way

               charges on his credit card statement that were listed as
               pending as of 091714 that he didn't make to his card. Deleon
               told me that one charge was to Walmart in the amount of $231.00
               and the other charge was to Wendy's in the amout of $21.00.
               Deleon told me that he was unable to determine a specific time
               for the charges, but he did know that they were made in
               Lynnwood, WA. He stated that he has cancelled the credit card
               and his bank was going to remove the charges from his account.
               I asked Deleon if he still had his credit card in his
               possession and he told me he did. I asked him what bank the
               card was through and he told me it was a Bank of America Visa
               credit card. Deleon told me he has no idea how his credit card
               was compromized, and has no idea who may have charged his
               credit card. Case inactive pending further leads. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               18th day of September, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               report of a female who had a seizure and fell out of bed
               striking her head on a cabinet. I arrived and found the female

               still coming out of the seizure and had some confusion, but was
               able to answer questions. By the time the medics arrived, she
               was able to fully answer their questions. She had a seizure
               plan printed on a piece of paper which listed her parents phone
               numbers as she is epileptic. I asked her if she wanted me to
               call them and she said yes. The roommate allowed me to use her
               phone as the patients was close to not having any battery left.
               I called and left a message as they didn't answer. The patient
               said she would call them later. I did not identify the patient
               or roommate as Hall Staff were on scene. They stated they would
               look into getting a railing possibly for the bed to prevent her
               from falling out of bed in the event of another seizure. She
               refused transport and I cleared. I certify and declare under
