               came to the WSU Police Department to report he had been
               receiving harassing treatment and text messages since the
               beginning of the school year. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: Derek Thompson (12-06-94) came to
               the WSU Police Department, along with two advocates from
               Alternatives to Violence of the Palouse, to report he had been
               receiving harassing treatment and text messages since the
               beginning of the school year. Thompson said he has been
               receiving several texts regarding a game he called "Fuck the
               slut". He said he has been deemed the "Slut" in the game. He
               said there are several people involved in this game. The
               apparent goal is to have sex with Thompson ("Fuck the slut").
               If a person who is playing the game is able to "Fuck the slut"
               they receive a monetary prize. Thompson does not know anyone
               who is playing the game by name. He only has the phone numbers
               the harassing texts have been sent from. He is going to the
               Verizon store after leaving the department to try to get
               printouts of his incoming and outgoing text messages. He says
               he has several screen shots he will e-mail to me in case he
               cannot get the text printouts from Verizon. The text messages
               have been received at Thompson's phone number of (208) 310-
               5498. He said he is going to have his phone number changed
               today (09-29-14). I asked Thompson if he is safe and he said "I
               think so". He feels like he is being watched by some of the
               text messages, but says he has not been physically assaulted.
               He has been staying with a friend for the last couple of days
               and says he will probably continue to do so. I told him as soon

               Exhibiting NARRATIVE: On 09/29/14 at approximately 2226 hours I
               was driving westbound on Cougar Way when I noticed 3 females
               walking eastbound on Cougar Way near Smith Gym. The three
               females were walking a breast and the middle female had her
               arms around the shoulders of the two outside females. The
               middle female, later identified as Amanda Kay Nelson 01/27/96,
               was stumbling side to side as she walked even though the other
               two females were helping her. Due to Nelson's in ability to
               walk straight, it was causing the whole group to move side to
               side as they walked. As I neared the three females, I noticed
               all three appeared to be under the age of 21. I passed the
               group and turned around to contact them. As I caught up to the
               group they were crossing Cougar Way in a crosswalk. I pulled
               next to the group and exited my patrol car. I told the group I
               needed to talk with them. Some one of in the group said they
               were fine and I told them they were not. The three stopped and
               I informed them they were being recorded. I told the three that
               the reason I was stopping to talk with them was because Nelson
               was very intoxicated. Nelson asked, "who?" I told Nelson that
               it was her. I told Nelson what I had observed when she was
               walking. I asked the three if any of them were roommates.
               Nelson said her and Mckenzie Biderbost Gillies 09/15/95 were.
               Gillies was standing to Nelson's left. I asked if everybody had
               their ID's with them and all three provided me with their WSU
               Cougar Cards. As Nelson was standing in the group she was still
               swaying in all directions. Nelson and Gillies were giggling
               back and forth which I found odd since they were being
               contacted by the Police. I noticed Gillies was also swaying
               side to side as she stood but not as much as Nelson was. I
               asked Nelson a series of questions to determine her mental
               status. Nelson answered all of my questions correctly but she
               was still laughing and giggling while she provided her answers.
               Nelson's movements were very exaggerated as if she was having
               difficulty controlling her movements. Gillies and Nelson kept
               giggling throughout my questions. I asked Nelson to come stand
               on the concrete since she was in a gravel patch. Nelson
               attempted to do so but she kept stumbling back and forth.

               Nelson almost fell over twice. I asked Nelson if I could look
               at her eyes and she said I could. I told Nelson to keep her
               head still and follow the tip of my pen with her eyes only.
               Nelson said she understood. As soon as I moved the pen, Nelson
               moved her head to follow the pen. I had to remind Nelson to
               keep her head still. Throughout the test, Nelson kept moving
               her head. I observed equal tracking, lack of smooth pursuit,
               and distinct and sustained nystagmus in both of Nelson's eyes.
               Nelson's eyes were bloodshot and watery. As Nelson stood before
               me I could clearly smell the overpowering odor of intoxicants
               coming from her breath. I asked Nelson how much she had to
               drink tonight. Nelson said she had three drinks. I asked if
               they were mixed drinks and she said yes. I asked Nelson if she
               mixed her drinks herself and she said no. Nelson said she
               started drinking at 2100 hours and had all three drinks by 2200
               hours. I asked Nelson if she was willing to provide a PBT
               sample. Nelson said she would. I found my PBT (Alco-Sensor FST
               #16805) in working condition. Nelson provided a sample and as
               the PBT was reading the sample, Nelson flung her arms
               downwards, striking my right hand that was holding the PBT. The
               PBT hit the ground causing it to turn off. I was unable to see
               what Nelson's PBT reading was. I told Nelson that she was under
               arrest for MIP Exhibiting and handcuffed (D/L) her. I advised
               Nelson of her right to counsel. Nelson was searched incident to
               arrest. Nothing of evidentiary value was found. Nelson was
               placed in the backseat of my patrol car. I next spoke with
               Gillies. I asked Gillies a series of questions to determine her
               mental status. Gillies was able to answer all my questions
               correctly. I asked Gillies how much she had to drink tonight
               and Gillies said one drink. I asked what kind of drink it was
               and she said it was as shot. Gillies then changed her mind and
               said two shots. I could smell the odor of intoxicants coming
               from her breath as Gillies stood before me. I asked Gillies if
               I could check her eyes and she said I could. I told Gillies to
               follow the tip of my pen and not to move her head. As soon as I
               moved the pen, Gillies moved her head to follow it. During the
               HGN test I observed, equal tracking, lack of smooth pursuit,
               and distinct and sustained nystagmus in both eyes. Gillies eyes
               were bloodshot and watery. Gillies was swaying in a side to
               side motion during the test. I told Gillies that based on the
               test I believed that she had drank much more than two shots.
               Gillies said she had two beers and three shots. I asked Gillies
               if she was willing to provide a PBT sample. Gillies asked what
               the results would do. I told Gillies that it would not effect
               anything that was going to happen. Gillies asked what was going
               to happen and I told her that she was going to be arrested for
               MIP Exhibiting. Gillies replied, "awesome, give it to me." I
               checked my PBT and found it was working correctly after Nelson
               had knocked it to the ground. Gillies provided a PBT sample of
               .216. I told Gillies that she was under arrest for MIP
               Exhibiting and handcuffed (D/L) her. I advised Gillies of her
               right to counsel. I handed Gillies over to Intern Roberts for
               searching. Gillies was stumbling back and forth as I handed her
               over. Gillies started to pull away from Intern Roberts and told
               him to just put her in the car. I walked over to Gillies and

               took control of her. I placed Gillies in the backseat as she
               became more argumentative. I lastly spoke with Molly Marilyn
               Holt 06/08/95. To this point Holt had stood out from Nelson and
               Gillies because she did not appear to be intoxicated like the
               other two. I asked Holt how much she had to drink tonight. Holt
               said she one beer. I asked Holt if I could check her eyes and
               she said I could. During the HGN test I did not observe any
               signs of HGN. I told Holt that I would not be arresting her for
               MIP Exhibiting however she would be referred to student
               conduct. Holt said she understood. I researched Nelson and
               Gillies and found they have not been contacted for drugs or
               alcohol. I pulled Nelson and Gillies out of the car one by one.
               I explained to each that I would be forwarding charges to the
               Prosecutor for MIP Exhibiting. I also explained they would be
               referred to student conduct. Both stated they understood.
               Nelson and Gillies were released from custody and handed over
               to Holt. Holt walked them into their dorm and I cleared.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 30th day of September, 2014, in

               09/29/14 at approximately 2332 hours I was pulling into the
               Regent's Parking lot when I noticed a female who was bent at
               the waist and resting her head on a parking sign pole. I
               stopped my patrol car next to the female, later identified as
               Alexis Nicole Cartwright 11/03/95, and walked up to her.
               Cartwright did not notice my patrol car or me. Cartwright was
               swaying side to side as she had her forehead on the pole. I
               asked Cartwright if she was ok. Cartwright said she was ok and
               her boyfriend was not here. Cartwright's response did not make
               sense. I noticed that Cartwright's eyes were only halfway open
               when she looked at me. Cartwright appeared to be under the age
               of 21. Cartwright appeared to be only wearing a men's dress
               shirt on. I asked Cartwright if she had pants on and she said
               she was at a "Risky Business" party. Cartwright said she had
               shorts on. As Cartwright spoke I could clearly smell the odor
               of intoxicants coming from her breath. I told Cartwright what I
               had observed and asked her a series of questions to determine
               her mental status. Cartwright was able to answer all of my
               questions correctly. I asked Cartwright how much she had to
               drink tonight. Cartwright said she had two beers. I asked
               Cartwright if she had her ID with and she provided her WSU
               Cougar Card. I asked Cartwright how old she was and Cartwright
               said she was 18 years old. I asked Cartwright if I could check
               her eyes. Carwright said I could. During the HGN test I
               observed, equal tracking, lack of smooth pursuit, and distinct
               and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes.
               Cartwright was swaying side to side during the test. I told
               Cartwright, based on my observations that I believed that she
               had much more than two beers to drink. I again asked Cartwright
               how much she had to drink. Cartwright said she had one beer and
               two glasses of wine. I asked Cartwright if she was willing to
               provide a PBT sample. Cartwright said she would. I found my PBT
               (Alco-Sensor FST #16805) in working condition. Cartwright
               provided a PBT sample of .215. I told Cartwright that she was
               under arrest for MIP Exhibiting and handcuffed (D/L) her.
               Cartwright was searched incident to arrest and nothing of
               evidentiary value was found. I placed Cartwright in the
               backseat of my patrol car while I researched her name. I found
               that Ofc. Petlovany had contacted Cartwright just 3 days

               earlier for MIP. At that time Cartwright provided a PBT sample
               of .134. Cartwright was warned for MIP at that time. I drove
               Cartwright the rest of the way to Cartwright's dorm, Perham
               Hall. I issued Cartwright Sector citation 4Z0871332 for RCW
               66.44.270.2B MIP Exhibiting. I explained the citation to
               Cartwright and provided her with her copy. Cartwright was
               released from custody and I cleared. Nothing further. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.
               Dated this 30th day of September, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.
