               approximately 0709 hours, I responded to the WSU blue 1 parking
               lot for a Vehicle Prowl call. Upon my arrival I contacted
               Nicholas T. Q. Nguyen (03-17-93). He showed me his 2004 Ford
               Taurus (WA/AKX2522), which had it's passenger side rear window
               busted out. There was glass on the ground as well as in the
               back seat of the vehicle. I also saw a die and some game pieces
               on the ground next to the vehicle. Nguyen said he parked his
               vehicle in the lot at approximately 0245 hours on 09-15-14. He
               said he came out to his vehicle at approximately 0700 hours on
               the same day. Nguyen said the only thing missing from his
               vehicle was a small vacuum. He said he did not know the name
               brand of the vacuum and said he had the charger and battery in
               the trunk of his vehicle. He said the vacuum was given to him
               so he has no idea of its value. He said he has no idea of who
               could have done this to his car. I took photographs of the
               damage to the vehicle and downloaded them to the WSU Police
               Computer System once back at the WSU Police Department. I did
               not find any finger prints on the vehicle. I gave Nguyen my
               business card with his Police Case number on it and cleared.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 15th day of September, 2014, in

               ON 09-13-14 I was on foot patrol in Martin Stadium during the
               WSU Football Game. While on patrol I heard that there was a
               unconscious female in the women's bathroom under section 32. I
               responded to the area and found a female, later identified as
               Sophia Brusasco, lying in the arms of an unidentified female.
               Brusasco was unconscious. I checked her for a pulse on her
               wrist and got about 80 beats per minute. I advised Stadium
               Command of the situation. They advised they were sending medics
               to the area. As I was sitting there I could smell a strong odor
               of intoxicating beverages coming from her persons. She was
               foaming at the mouth. I had the other female leave Brusasco's
               side so we could place her on her side and keep her airway
               open. As we were waiting I saw Pullman Fire Captain Tony
               Nuttman walk by. I asked him if he would come help and he did.
               He was checking on the progress of the medics and was
               monitoring her vitals. About 10 minutes later the ambulance
               crew arrived and transported her to the hospital to be detoxed.

               ON 09-13-14 I was on patrol in Martin Stadium for the WSU
               Football Game. I was working on the north concourse when I saw
               two males carrying a male, later identified as Robert C.
               Kendrick, between them. The male between them was barely able
               to walk. He appeared to be under 21 years of age. Concerned for
               Kendrick's welfare I contacted the three. I asked them to step
               out of the crowd and by the fence. Kendrick was swaying back
               and forth. I asked him if he was all right and he said "A
               little drunk." I asked him for his identification. He provided
               me his High School ASB Card. The name and picture matched him.
               As he spoke his speech was slurred as he spoke and I could
               smell a very strong odor of intoxicating beverages coming from
               his breath. I told him I would be sending him to student
               conduct for MIP-Exhibiting. I asked his two friends if they
               would be willing to get him home and they said they were on
               their way home with him. Due to our call volume and large
               amount of radio traffic I didn't identify the two friends. They
               had not been drinking. Refer to student conduct. I certify and

               Bustad Hall when its driver side mirror was struck by the
               mirror of a UPS delivery truck. I spoke with the bus driver,
               Gretchen M. Pesho (12-28-55), who said she believes the UPS
               driver may not have even realized he collided with her bus. She
               said the driver continued North on Stadium Way and then turned
               East on Grimes Way after striking her bus. She said there were
               no injuries to people, just damage to the mirror. The mirror
               was un operable and took the bus out of service. I took photos
               of the damage to the mirror, which I downloaded onto the WSU
               Police Computer System when I got back to the station, and gave
               Pesho my business card with her case number on it. I asked her
               to contact me when she determined how much it cost to repair
               the mirror. Just as I was about to clear to go to the UPS
               office in Pullman for follow up, another Pullman Transit bus
               pulled up to the bus stop area. As it was pulling up along side
               the "Out of service" bus it struck the "Out of service" bus
               driver side mirror on its passenger side. I created a separate
               case number for this non-injury accident (14-W3500). I
               responded to the UPS office and spoke with the supervisor,
               Mekaela D. Mckanna (05-22-88). I explained the situation to
               Mckanna and she said there are two drivers who could have been
               the driver involved in the accident. She said she would not
               know who it was until after 1800 hours, when they came back in
               to the office from their delivery day. I left my business card
               with her and asked her to call the non-emergency dispatch phone
               number when the drivers returned for the day so one of our
               Officers could come down to interview them and take photos of
               the vehicle. She said she would do so. I informed Sgt. Griffin
               and Officer Stewart of the situation and asked if one of them
               would conduct the follow up for me. More to follow. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.

               run accident involving a Pullman Transit bus and a UPS delivery
               vehicle on Stadium Way at the Bustad Hall bus stop. This bus
               had been taken "Out of Service" due to a damaged driver side
               mirror. As the replacement bus was pulling along side the "Out
               of Service" bus, its passenger side collided with its driver
               side mirror. I took photographs of the damage to the
               replacement bus (WA/52510D) and identified the driver. There
               was only scrapes to the Cougar decals on the passenger side of
               the replacement bus. The driver was identified as Shaun P.

               Upon contact, Makaylin M. Askevold told me the following. On
               091314 at approximately 1600 hours, she tried to get into the
               WSU vs. Portland State football game but she was stopped at the
               student gate and subsequently taken to the hospital for an
               alcohol detox. She told me that when she was contacted by
               Pullman Fire Medics, she had her purse, ID and cell phone. At
               approximately 2000 hours, shortly after she was released from
               the hospital, she noticed her purse was missing but she still
               had her ID and phone. She stated that she contacted Pullman
               Fire Department and the Pullman Regional Hospital ER department
               and neither location had her purse. I asked Askevold to
               describe her purse and she told me it was a black foux leather
               sachel style purse valued at $10.00. She stated there was
               approximately $10.00 in US Currency, her cougar card, a debit
               card (that she already cancelled), and a I phone charger valued
               at $30.00. I advised her to contact WSU Athletics to see if her
               purse was turned in to their department during the game. I
               provided Askevold with the case number and advised her to call
               back if she locates her purse. Case inactive pending further

               Suspect contacted and she admitted to causing the collision and

               C. Santos Hernandez (081595) Cited Hit and Run Unattended
               4Z0156167 2. NARRATIVE: On 091514 at approximately 1823 hours,
               I was dispatched to a report of a hit and run collision in the
               old ER entrance to the WSU Health and Wellness center parking
               lot. Upon arrival, I contacted Aurora A. Horstkamp who told me
               the following. At approximately 1815 hours, an unknown male
               approached her in her office and told her that a girl driving a
               Red Hyundai Sonota WA/APL3930 backed into her white Ford
               Explorer (WA/467UHX) at approximately 1745 hours in the old ER
               entrance to Health and Wellness parking lot. She stated that
               the witness told her he saw the collision and then headed to
               the Pets are People Too store and saw the suspect vehicle park
               in the tanning salon parking lot near Pets are People Too. He
               stated he took pictures of the vehicle and would email her the
               pictures. I asked Aurora if she knew the male and she told me
               she didn't. She stated that he asked a coworker of hers if they
               knew who owned her vehicle and they identified her. Aurora
               showed me where the vehicle struck hers. I noticed her car was
               parked in the parking spaces along the south curb and was
               perpendicular to the parking spaces on the north side of the
               parking lot. Aurora stated that the suspect, later identified
               as Sandra C. Santos Hernandez, backed out of one of the north
               parking spaces and hit the rear bumper of her car. In looking
               at the rear passenger side corner of the bumper, I noticed
               several paint transfer marks one of which was burgundy in
               color. I saw that the rear bumper was pushed approximately one
               to two inches in the direction of the driver's side of the
               vehicle. It appeared that the bumper was also pushed in
               slightly causing a dent in the under carriage of the passenger
               side rear quarter panel. I estimated the damage to Aurora's
               vehicle at approximately $1000.00. I took photographs of the
               damage to her car and provided her with the case number. I
               advised her I would call if I was able to locate Sandra's
               vehicle. I responded to the area of Pets are People Too and
               noticed a burgundy Hyundai Sonota with a matching license
               plate. As I pulled up to the vehicle, Sandra and her friend
               Sarah Al Baidi walked out of the salon and contacted me. I
               asked Sandra if she knew why I was there and she stated, "Is it

               because I bumped that car." I told her it was. I asked her if
               she was driving the Sonota at the time of the collision and she
               told me that she was. I asked her why she left the scene and
               she told me that she just bumped it and that's what she always
               does when she bumped cars back in Vancouver. I explained to her
               that what she did was hit and run which is a criminal offense.
               She stated that she didn't know. I asked her for her driver's
               license, registration and proof of insurance which she
               provided. I checked the rear bumper of her car and noticed an
               approximate two to three inch crack in the bumper and a
               circular impact point where she collided with the bumper of
               Aurora's vehicle. I asked her if the damage to her car was the
               damage from the collision with Aurora's vehicle and she told me
               it was. I took photographs of the damage and estimated the
               value at approximately $800.00. I explained to Sandra that I
               was going to issue her a criminal citation for hit and run
               unattended. She told me she understood. I completed a Sector
               citation (4Z0156167) and issued it to her. I explained the
               citation to her and released her from the contact. I returned
               to the WSU Police Department and contacted Aurora's husband
               John Horstkamp. I explained to John that I contacted Sandra and
               issued her a citation for Hit and Run Unattended. John told me
               that he had already contacted Sandra in the parking lot and had
               obtained her insurance information and contact information
               prior to me contacting her. I advised him to provide that
               information to his insurance and they will sort out the civil
               issues. He thanked me for my time and we ended the call.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 15th day of September, 2014, in
