    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: JAK/333 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W3318 SYNOPSIS: While on routine patrol,
               I found someone had spray painted the words "Go Huskies" on the
               WSU Arch, located near Allbrook Hall. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 09-07-14, at approximately
               0702 hours, I was on routine patrol when I observed white spray
               paint on the WSU Arch, which is located near Allbrook Hall.
               Upon further investigation, I saw someone had painted the words
               "Go Huskies" in white spray paint on the inside sections of the
               WSU Arch. I contacted Officer Boyd (335) via radio and asked
               him if the paint had been reported. He said he did not believe
               so; therefore, I had Whitcom create a case for Malicious
               Mischief. I took photographs of the paint, which were
               downloaded onto the WSU Police Computer system when I returned
               to the station. I contacted WSU Facilities Operations and
               notified them they could have the spray paint cleaned off as we
               were done with the case. I have no suspects, leads, or idea of
               when this occurred. Nothing further. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               7th day of September, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               09/08/14 at approximately 0035 hours I was dispatched to a
               drugs call at Stephenson East room 419. Upon arrival the
               reporting party, Ross A. Mcclure 12/30/86 said he could smell
               the faint odor of marijuana coming from the room. I walked up
               to room 419 and smelled the crack of the door. I could not
               smell any odor of marijuana or masking agents. I knocked on the
               door and two females answered. The females were identified as,
               Alexis A. Ary 03/01/96 and Emily E. Durka 04/13/96. When the

               told the two why I had been called and both Ary and Durka
               stated they did not have any marijuana. I asked if they had a
               friend over that could have recently smoked and could have
               smelled of marijuana. Both said no. While I was talking to the
               two I believed their answers to be genuine and truthful. I
               asked Ofc. Stewart if he could smell any burnt or fresh
               marijuana and he said no. Having no evidence of marijuana or
               marijuana usage I apologized for waking them up and cleared.
               There is no evidence that a crime occurred. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 8th day of September, 2014, in Pullman,
