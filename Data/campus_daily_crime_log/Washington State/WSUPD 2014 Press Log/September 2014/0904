    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC:MTK/336 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #:14-W3254 SYNOPSIS: Report of a sex offense
               which occurred in 2013. Information forwarded to Title IX
               compliance. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 09/04/14 I was provided with a "Crime Statistic
               Report Form" that was received by the WSUPD on 09/03/14. The
               report form was completed by Corrinna McGrath and states that a
               student informed her of a rape that occurred in the Spring of
               2013 in a residence hall. The report states that the student
               did not want to press charges or seek counseling/guidance. I
               called McGrath and explained to her how I came about the
               report. I asked McGrath if she had reported the incident to OEO
               for Title IX compliance investigation and she said that she had
               not. I told McGrath that I would handle that for her. I asked
               McGrath if she wanted to provide me with any other information
               and she said the only information she had is what was in the
               report she submitted. I asked McGrath where she got the report
               form and she said Athletic's Department provided her with it.
               McGrath added that she could narrow the time it occurred to
               between January and April of 2013. I called OEO and spoke with
               Dan and Holly. I explained the report to them and they said
               they would contact McGrath to complete the investigation. At
               this time I do not have a name of a suspect or victim. There is
               no criminal investigation at this time. If the victim comes
               forward the case can be re-opened. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 4th day of
               September, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               Victim 2. NARRATIVE: On 09/04/14 at approximately 1045 hours,
               Devron Gray reported his laptop as stolen. I called Gray and
               asked him what happened. Gray said that on 09/02/04 at
               approximately 2100 hours his laptop was taken from Cleveland
               Hall MLC room 130. Gray said the computer lab was closing at
               that time and only a few students and staff were around. Gray
               described the laptop as a black and red HP Envy Ultrabook. Gray
               said the laptop was worth $600.00. Gray said he contacted the
               "manager" of the lab who told him the laptop was not turned
               into the lost and found. I asked Gray for the serial number and
               he said he did not have it, but would check with his mom to see
               if she could find it. Gray provided me with his Network ID
               number, which I passed along to IT securities group. I sent
               Gray an email with the case number and my contact information.
               At this time there are no suspects or leads. If Gray provides
               me with the serial number I will re-activate the case and enter
               it into NCIC. IT securities notified me that they will keep an
               eye out for the laptop being used on the WSU network. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.

               a protection order. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               Carver, Alfred J (060992) Info Only Violation of Order 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 090414 around 1225 hrs I was dispatched to a
               report of a possible violation of a protection order. I was
               asked to call the reporting party, later identified as Janae J
               Costa (073194), and was told the following. Costa explained she
               believed she had received an instant message over facebook from
               Alfred J Carver (060992). She went on to tell me there is a
               protection order in place against Carver and he is not allowed
               to contact her. As we continued to speak about this she went on
               to tell me she believed Carver had used his mothers Facebook
               account to send the message. When I asked her about the message
               and why she believed it had been Alfred she explained it was an
               apology letter for incidents from the past. I asked Costa if
               she had a contact number for Carver and was told she did not,
               but she was able to provide one for Mona T Carver (021693), who
               is Alfred's mother. I asked Costa if she could email me the
               screen shots of the message she received from Carver and after
               providing her with my email address was told she would. Prior
               to concluding my conversation with her she told me several
               times she just wanted Carver to not contact her and did not
               want him to get into any further trouble over this incident. I
               explained that I would try and contact him and convey her
               wishes. After speaking with Costa I contacted Mona and was told
               the following. Mona, when asked, admitted to having instant
               messaged Costa. When asked why she explained she had received a
               letter, as had everyone else in the family, making amends for
               his actions and asking for forgiveness. She went on to say she
               received a letter from Alfred asking her to contact Costa and
               pass along his amends letter to her. I asked if she was aware
               of Alfred's restraining order she told me she was aware of it,
               but not familiar with it. I explained he was restrained from
               contacting Costa, at which point she told me as a part of his
               program he was attending in jail she believed her contacting
               Costa was ok. I looked at the return and noticed third party
               contact was not listed and told Mona that I would contact
               Thurston County to ask about the order and call her back. A
               short time later I contacted the Thurston County Sheriff's
               Office and asked about the order. A short time later I received
               a copy of the order, which I later attached to this case. In
               the order it specifies Carver is not allowed to have contact
               with Costa, including by third party. At seeing this I

               contacted Mona again. Upon reaching her I explained what I had
               learned about the order. Mona was upset and told me she had no
               idea this would have resulted in Alfred getting into trouble
               and believed it had been sanctioned by the court since Alfred
               was still incarcerated. She went on to tell me had she known
               about the possible trouble this would have caused she would
               never have sent the message to Costa. I explained Costa did not
               wish for Alfred to get into any further trouble but did not
               wish to have any contact with him. Mona told me she understood
               and asked me to apologize to Costa if I spoke with her again.
               We spoke for a few minutes more before I concluded my call with
               her and contacted Merritt Decker of the Whitman County
               Prosecuting Attorney's Office regarding this case. Upon
               reaching Decker I explained the case to him and asked him if he
               would like me to forward the case to him requesting charges and
               after a brief conversation he asked me to send it over as
               informational only so they could look at it and keep it on file
               in the event other violations occur. I told him I would do that
               and contacted Mona to explain what I had been told. We spoke
               for a short time longer on this issue before we concluded our
               conversation and I attempted to contact Costa again. I left her
               a message asking her to contact me and as of 1454 hrs I have
               still not received the email of the text message she had
               received from Mona. I will attempt to contact her again to
               update her and request the email of the message she received.
               At 1510 hrs I was contacted by Costa. I explained what I had
               learned and she again told me she did not wish to pursue any
               criminal charges against Carver. She went on to tell me she
               would email me the message she had received for the case file
               and I thanked her. I will attach the email upon receiving it.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 4th day of September, 2014, in

               hours, I responded to a non injury accident in the Green
               parking lot at the corner of Washington St and Idaho St. I
               contacted both parties who confirmed there were no injuries.
               The drivers were identified by WA Driver's Licenses. They
               stated Chandra was parked in the middle of the parking lot
               waiting for a space and Foit backed out of his space striking
               Chandra's vehicle. Chandra's vehicle had been moved prior to my
               arrival. I took photographs of both vehicles and help them
               exchange information with each other. I provided them with a
               business card and case number and answered their questions. I
               cleared. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 4th day of September, 2014 in Pullman,

               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Jade S. Wong Protective Custody 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 09-04-14 at approximately 1526 hours, Ofc. Welter
               and I responded to Thompson Hall to try and locate Jade Wong.
               The RP, Samuel Diedesch, stated he had broken up with Jade and
               she had been upset about it. Around 1300 hours, she began
               texting him and around 1330 hours made a comment, "I don't want
               to be here anymore". He stated she had threatened to take pills
               and at approximately 1440 hours, he contacted her at her room.
               He stated he talked her into giving the pills, a large bag of
               Tylenol, by stating he would walk her to class and they could
               talk after her class. Sam said at first she stated she had
               taken some of the pills, but after he threatened to call the
               police she stated she had lied to him and had not taken any of
               the pills. Sam walked her to her class at Thompson Hall and
               then called us. He also stated she has threatened to harm
               herself three times in the previously. At Thompson Hall I
               stepped into the classroom and asked if Jade was in the class.
               She said yes and I asked her if she would speak to me in the
               hallway. She came out and put her head down, not making eye
               contact. I asked her what was going on today and she stated she
               had said something stupid. She stated she was tired and was
               upset about the break up. I asked her if she had stated she was
               going to hurt herself and she said yes. She stated it was
               stupid and she was sorry. She was asked how she was going to do
               it and she said by taking some pills. She admitted to making
               the statement about not wanting to be here anymore. I asked her
               if she was currently seeking counseling and she said no. I
               asked her if she had taken any of the pills and she said no. I
               asked her if she currently takes medications and she said no. I
               advised her she need to be taken to PRH for evaluation based on
               the statements she made. I advised her she could go voluntarily
               if she wanted and she said she would. I had her collect her
               things from the class and Ofc. Welter spoke briefly to the
               Professor. As I walked her out to my vehicle, she began to cry
               stating this whole thing was embarrassing and didn't understand
               why she couldn't finish her class. While en route to the PRH,
               she began crying more and was upset stating she couldn't afford
               to pay a hospital bill. When we arrived she began to say she
               didn't want to be there. At this time I advised her she was in
               Protective Custody and she stated she understood. I escorted

               the back of the form. A copy of the form has been entered into
               Files in Spillman. Dr. Jones asked me to call Sam and verify
               with him the times Jade may have taken the pills. I called him
               and he provided the times listed in the report. Sam was clearly
               upset and I made sure he was aware of the resources available
               to him. He stated he had made an appointment with Counseling
               Services for tomorrow morning. I advised him to call if he had
               any further questions. I provided Jade a business card with the
               Dean of Students phone number as she requested. I cleared. I
               later sent WSU Counseling Services and Dean of Students Office
               an email regarding this case. The email was attached in Files.

               he had his wallet was on 09-02-14, at approximately 0900 hours.
               He said he believes it was in his pocket when he was leaving
               his room (Northside Hall, room 244). He didn't realize it was

               the wallet. He said the only items in the wallet at the time it
               went missing were his Ohio state driver's license, his debit
               card from Hunnington Bank, and his WSU Cougar Card. He said he

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Boyd/335 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W3269 SYNOPSIS: Report of the odor of
               marijuana coming from room 507 Goldsworthy. Two subjects were
               contacted and admitted smoking marijuana in the room. Incident
               forwarded to Student Conduct. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Kyle E. Peterson/041596 Warned Poss Marijuana
               2. Madeline L. Newell/050996 Warned Poss Marijuana NARRATIVE:
               On 09/04/14 at about 2135 hrs Dispatch advised of a report of
               the odor of marijuana coming from room 507 Goldsworthy Hall. I
               responded and upon my arrival could smell a faint odor of
               marijuana coming from room 507 Goldsworthy. I knocked on the
               door and a male, later identified as Kyle E. Peterson (041596),
               answered the door. I asked if he lived there and he said he
               did. I asked for everyone who was in the room to step out and a
               female, later identified as Madeline L. Newell (050996), exited
               the room with Peterson. I could smell a stronger odor of burnt
               marijuana coming from the room with the door open. I told them
               I received a report of the odor of marijuana coming from the
               room and I could smell the odor of marijuana coming from the
               room. I asked if they had been smoking marijuana in the room
               and Peterson admitted they had been smoking marijuana. I told
               him I was going to provide him with two options. The first was
               to retrieve any marijuana and drug paraphernalia he had in the
               room and we would go destroy them. I told him the incident
               would then be forwarded to WSU Student Conduct. I told him the
               other option was to require I obtain a search warrant. I told
               him I would seize his room as evidence and they would be free
               to go. I told him I would apply for a search warrant and should
               the search warrant be granted I would search his room and
               anything found would be sent to student conduct and the court.
               I told Peterson to think about it for a minute. I asked him to
               get his driver's license while he was thinking. He provided me
               with a military ID and Newell provided me her WSU student ID
               and date of birth. I confirmed the information provided through
               Dispatch. I asked Peterson how he would like to handle the
               situation. He said he would get the marijuana from his room. He
               retrieved a glass bong, pipe, grinder, and plastic canister
               containing a small amount of marijuana. I walked with Peterson
               outside where I had him destroy all of the items at the
               dumpster. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 05 day of September,
               2014, in Pullman, Washington.
