               reported that they had located a lost permit inside a parked
               vehicle. Mariama N. Chavis (DOB 03-20-1995) was contacted and
               criminal charges will be forwarded to the Whitman County

               Forwarded Theft 2. NARRATIVE: On 09-30-2014 at about 1040 hrs I
               was dispatched to a report of a theft. I contacted the
               complainant, Melissia M. Reisenauer (DOB 08-08-1968), on the
               telephone. Reisenauer works for WSU Parking Services.
               Reisenauer reported that parking enforcement personnel had
               located a WSU parking permit, that had been reported as lost,
               in an unoccupied vehicle parked in a parking lot. The parking
               lot was identified as the yellow lot located southwest of the
               intersection of Spokane Street and Columbia Street. Reisenauer
               identified the lost parking permit as #YE10160. According to
               parking services records, the owner of this permit was
               identified as Yinan Zhou (DOB 06-01-1992). Zhou resides at 910
               NE Providence Court #D202 in Pullman, Washington. Reisenauer
               stated that the permit was mailed to Zhou, but Zhou reported
               that her permit never showed up in the mail. Reisenauer said
               that WSU Parking Services issued a new parking permit to Zhou
               after she reported her original permit as lost. Reisenauer
               stated that the value of the permit at the beginning of the
               school year was $293.04, and the current value of the permit
               was $280.83. I responded to the parking lot and located the
               vehicle, which had been ticketed and wheel-locked by WSU
               Parking Services. The vehicle did not have any license plates
               but had a temporary permit taped to the rear window. The
               vehicle was identified as a black, 2014 Nissan Juke (VIN:
               JN8AF5MV7ET355151). According to the information on the
               temporary permit, the vehicle had been recently purchased from
               a dealership in Lewiston, Idaho. I saw that parking permit
               #YE10160 was displayed in the driver's side corner of the
               windshield. I photographed the vehicle and the permit, and the
               photographs were downloaded into Spillman. While I was in the
               parking lot, an adult female, who was later identified as
               Mariama M. Chavis (DOB 03-20-1995), arrived on scene. Chavis
               said the vehicle belonged to her, and stated that she had
               parked it in the parking lot earlier this day. I explained the
               situation to Chavis and questioned her about the parking
               permit. sign say yellow parking permit required mon to fri 0700

               at Terrace Apartments. DRIVER 1: SUA-KALIO, Emmittwally L.
               (11/17/94) VEHICLE 1: 1LD1626/ID, 1985 Ford Ranger red in color

               DAMAGE: Chain link fence and post Estimated at $######
               WITNESS(ES): None NARRATIVE: On September 30, 2014 at about
               1100 hours I was dispatched to a non injury vehicle versus
               fence collision at the Terrace Apartments. I responded to the
               area and located the vehicle on Garden Ave near Merman Drive
               across from the Park and Ride Lot. Sua-Kalio told me he was
               turning left from Merman onto Garden Ave. He went on to say it
               was "hard to turn the wheel." He said as he braked the wheel
               didn't turn. Sua-Kalio ran into the Garden Ave curb with the
               front passenger wheel. The front passenger side of the truck
               collided with a four (4) foot tall chain link fence. A fence
               pole was knocked over. The truck came to rest back on Garden
               Ave next to the fence. Sua-Kalio said he was going 20 to 25
               MPH. The speed limit on Merman and Valley Roads is 25 MPH.
               There were striated tire marks on the ground where the vehicle
               turned from Merman onto Garden Ave. It appears that he was
               traveling faster than the posted speeded limit. I checked the
               tread depth on the front passenger tire. It was barely 2/32 of
               an inch. The rubber was cracked and checked. The tire was in
               overall poor condition. I checked the front driver's side tire.
               It was also in poor condition. The tire pressure on the
               driver's side tire was 10 PSI. Looking at the truck it was not
               in good condition. It did not look or sound like maintenance
               was routinely performed on this vehicle. Sua-Kalio provided me
               with the vehicle registration and his American Samoa driver's
               license. He did not have any proof of insurance. I was provided
               the contact information for the owner of the vehicle Caleb D.
               Jones. I called Jones and left a message for him on September
               30, 2014 at about 1331 hours. With the assistance of WSU
               Housing Grounds personnel Sua-Kalio was able to change the
               truck tire and move the vehicle. In addition I learned he was
               trespassed from the WSU Campus. I told him about the trespass.
               He said he did not know that the Terrace Apartments were part
               of the campus. I provided him with education about where the
               boundaries of campus are. I gave him a warning regarding the
               trespass. Damage to the fence is estimated at $####. Digital
               photos of the scene were taken. WSU Housing personnel were on

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: JAK/333 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W3840 SYNOPSIS: Madeleine B. Jerome (02-
               06-96) came in to the WSU Police to report she has been being
               harassed by her ex-boyfriend, Christopher J. Neil (01-31-96).
               As of 1040 hours on 09-30-14, the harassment has stopped.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 09-30-
               14, Madeleine B. Jerome (02-06-96) came in to the WSU Police
               Department to report she has been being harassed by her ex-
               boyfriend, Christopher J. Neil (01-31-96). Jerome said she
               broke up with Neil on Wednesday, 09-24-14. She said Neil had
               been diagnosed as being bi-polar and had been making irrational
               decisions lately. She had grown increasingly uncomfortable with
               the way Neil was acting and decided to break up with him.
               Jerome said Neil is very technology savvy and began texting her
               using a phone number that was not his. She said Neil used a
               computer to text her using a 208 area coded phone number. She
               said Neil sent her several text messages stating reasons she
               should not have broke up with her boyfriend. She became
               suspicious the text messages were coming from Neil and asked
               several times if it was him texting her. The "Secret admirer"
               kept saying he was not Neil. Jerome said Neil went home over
               the weekend of 09-26-14 to 09-28-14 and contacted her when he
               returned to Pullman. He asked to meet with her and advised her
               to wear walking shoes, a jacket, and not to eat prior to
               meeting him. She said they walked around the south side of
               campus and he kept trying to hold her hand and hug her as they
               walked. She continued denying him. She said she has never been
               afraid of Neil, but said he kept alternating between asking her
               to get back together with him and being very angry about the
               break up. After they separated for the night Neil called Jerome
               and apologized for how he had acted. Jerome told Neil she was
               planning on going to the Police regarding the "Secret Admirer"
               the next day and he admitted to it having been him who had been
               texting her from a fake phone number on his computer. Jerome
               told Neil to stop contacting her and to stay away from her.
               Neil texted her around 0400 hours on 09-30-14 stating he had
               checked himself into the Emergency Room as he believes he had a
               psychotic episode. He sent Jerome a facebook message with a
               picture of his hospital bracelet and at approximately 1036
               hours Jerome replied with the message "Stop contacting me".
               Jerome's facebook app indicated Neil had read the message at
               approximately 1040 hours. As of the time Jerome left the Police
               department (1202 hours) Neil had not attempted to contact her.
               I gave Jerome my business card with her case number on it and

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
               asked her what else I could do for her. She said she did not
               want to get Neil in trouble, but wanted him to stop contacting
               her. I advised her of her option to file for an anti-harassment
               order and she said she did not feel she needed one. I asked her
               to please contact me if Neil tried contacting her again and
               told her to call 911 if she felt she was not safe at any point.
               Nothing further at this time. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 30th day of

               Quinn had not answered his telephone today and was not
               responding to email and Facebook messages. Beth told me that
               this was unusual for Quinn, and she requested that I attempt to
               locate him and check his welfare. I responded to Honors Hall
               and located Quinn in his room, #245B. Quinn was asleep when I
               arrived, but after waking him up, he stated that he was fine
               and did not need any medical attention. I cleared the scene. I
               called Beth and advised her that Quinn had been located and
               appeared to be fine. No further action at this time.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W3848 SYNOPSIS: Report of the odor of
               marijuana coming from room 803 Stephenson North. Subject was
               contacted and warned for possession of marijuana. Incident sent
               to student conduct. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Amy
               T. Strickland/072596 Warned poss Marijuana 2. Summer N.
               Spencer/041996 Warned poss Marijuana NARRATIVE: On 10/01/14 at
               about 0101 hrs Dispatch advised of a resident in Stephenson
               North reporting the odor of marijuana coming from room 803.
               Officer Westerman and I responded. Upon arriving at room 803 I
               could smell a strong odor of marijuana emitting from the room.
               I knocked on the door and a female, later identified as Amy T.
               Strickland (072596), answered the door. I asked Strickland to
               step out of the room and she did so. Another female, later
               identified as Summer N. Spencer (041996), also exited the room.
               I explained to Strickland she had two options. She could either
               retrieve all her marijuana and paraphernalia from the room and
               we would destroy it and I would send the incident to student
               conduct. I told her the other option was for me to seize her
               room and apply for a search warrant which may or may not be
               granted. I told her if the search warrant was granted I would
               search the room and anything found would be dealt with through
               student conduct and the court. I had Strickland retrieve her ID
               while she thought about the choices. She provided me with her
               Washington Driver's license. Strickland chose to retrieve the
               items from her room. She produced a small jar with marijuana in
               it and two glass pipes. I walked out to the dumpster with her
               where I watched her destroy the items. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 01 day of October, 2014, in Pullman,
