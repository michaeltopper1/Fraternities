    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Olmstead/339 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W3212 SYNOPSIS: Joshua B. McPhatter (DOB
               06-24-1989) reported the odor of marijuana originating from
               Rogers Hall #1019. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               Nicholas T. Salle / 11-26-1995 Warned Possession Marijuana 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 09-01-2014 at about 1239 hrs I was dispatched to
               a report of the odor of marijuana in Rogers Hall, located at
               1355 SE Olympia Avenue. I contacted the complainant, Joshua B.
               McPhatter (DOB 06-24-1989), on the telephone. McPhatter is the
               hall director for Stephenson East. McPhatter reported that he
               had detected the odor of marijuana originating from room #1019.
               After reviewing the circumstances of the incident with
               McPhatter, I determined that the situation did not meet my
               criteria for a search warrant application. I explained to
               McPhatter that I would not be applying for a search warrant and
               would respond to Rogers Hall. Officer Jones and I arrived on
               the 10th floor of Rogers Hall and contacted McPhatter and two
               other hall staff members. While standing in the hallway, one of
               the hall staff members pointed out a male who was walking out
               of the nearby study lounge and told me that the male was a
               resident of room #1019. I contacted the male, who was later
               identified as Nicholas T. Salle (DOB 11-26-1995). Salle was 18
               years old. I explained the situation to Salle and questioned
               him about marijuana usage in his room. Salle told me that no
               one had been smoking marijuana in his room today. Salle stated
               that some individuals had been smoking marijuana outside the
               building and had walked back into Rogers Hall and his room.
               Salle would not clarify if he had been in this group and would
               not tell me who was involved. Salle said there was no marijuana
               or other illegal drugs in his room. I asked Salle if he would
               grant me consent to search his room, and he said no. I warned
               Salle about marijuana usage and possession. I told Salle that
               it had been brought to my attention that this was the third
               time officers and hall staff had responded to his room for
               marijuana related issues. Salle's roommate was identified as
               Kellen J. O'Connor (DOB 08-08-1995). O'Connor is 19 years old.
               Salle stated that O'Connor was not around and had left about
               three hours ago. I told Salle that this case would be reviewed
               by WSU Student Conduct. Officer Jones and I cleared the scene.
               No further action at this time. Olmstead/339 I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               smoking marijuana in a vehicle near Stephenson Hall. Subjects
               were contacted, charges forwarded for possession of marijuana.

               Forward Charges Poss Marijuana 2. Neil E. Druliner/022596
               Forward Charges Poss Marijuana NARRATIVE: On 09/01/14 at about
               2135 hrs I heard two WSU Police Interns who were on foot patrol
               advise of two subjects who were smoking marijuana in a car near
               Stephenson Hall. Officer Stewart and I responded and located
               the subjects, sitting in a vehicle (WA ALL7945), at the east
               end of the grey parking lot at Stephenson Hall. As we
               approached the vehicle I could hear glass clink and it sounded
               like they were trying to hide something. I walked up the
               driver's side of the vehicle and could see a male, later
               identified as Neil E. Druliner (022596), sitting in the
               driver's seat. I could see what I recognized, based on my
               training and experience, to be a bong bowl which was full of
               burnt marijuana. There was a very strong odor of burnt
               marijuana emitting from the vehicle. Officer Stewart contacted
               a female who was sitting in the passenger seat, later
               identified as Antonia A. Tandy, and asked what they were doing.
               She said "good". He said, no what are you doing and they did
               not respond. He asked what Druliner had in his right hand and
               again they did not respond. We directed them to exit the
               vehicle and they did so. I had Druliner place the bong
               stem/bowl on top of the car. I asked them for ID and Druliner
               provided me with his driver's license. Tandy provided Officer
               Stewart with her name and date of birth, which was confirmed
               through Dispatch. Druliner told us the vehicle belonged to his
               roommate, who was letting him use it. I had Druliner call his
               roommate so we could speak with him. While we were waiting we
               asked Tandy to retrieve the marijuana from the car. I could see
               a glass bong under the passenger seat as well as a small
               plastic bag with marijuana inside. Tandy removed the bong and
               two plastic bags containing marijuana from the vehicle. She
               also provided me with an empty film canister which appeared to
               have been used previously to store marijuana. Officer Stewart
               asked who's marijuana it was and Tandy said it was hers, as
               well as the bong. Druliner admitted to smoking marijuana with
               Tandy. I spoke with the vehicle owner, Brandon T. Gundersen
               (101395), and told him what was going on. He told me he did now
               know Druliner was smoking in his vehicle. Gundersen said he let
               Druliner use his vehicle to meet up with a girl but did not

               know they would be smoking in the vehicle. I asked Gundersen if
               I could search his car to make sure there was no more marijuana
               inside and he said that was fine. I searched the vehicle and
               found no additional evidence. Officer Stewart spoke with
               Tandy's legal guardian, James R. Tandy (041852), because she
               was under 18. He told James what was going on and that charges
               would be forwarded to the prosecutor for possession of
               marijuana. I also explained I would be forwarding charges to
               the prosecutor to Tandy and Druliner. I collected the bags of
               marijuana and bong as evidence. Nothing further. I certify and

               a subject who had been drinking in the bar at the Residence Inn
               who went out to his car and was now passed out in the driver's
               seat. Officer Stewart and I responded. I located the subject,
               later identified as Scott M. Wallace (122963), who appeared to
               be passed out in the driver's seat of his vehicle. The vehicle
               was not running but the keys were in the ignition and the
               vehicle's accessory power was activated. I opened the door and
               woke Wallace, who was clearly intoxicated. He spoke with
               slurred speech and smelled strongly of intoxicants. Wallace
               said he came to his car to get some things to take up to his
               room. He was able to answer my questions and tell me where he
               was and what room he was staying in. We had the medics cancel
               their response because Wallace was not in need of any medical
               attention. Hotel staff made sure Wallace returned to his room

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W3218 SYNOPSIS: Drugs call in Rogers Hall
               335. Subject was contacted and she destroyed her marijuana and
               paraphernalia. Student Conduct only. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Siena C. Williams (032796) Warned Possession
               Marijuana 2. NARRATIVE: On 090214 at approximately 0013 hours,
               I was dispatched to a report of marijuana emanating from room
               335 in Rogers Hall. Upon arrival, I could smell a faint odor of
               marijuana coming from the room. I knocked on the door and
               contacted both occupants of the room who identified themselves
               as Siena C. Williams and Saleam S. Solomon. I asked both to
               come out in the hallway and talk to me and they did. I
               explained to both of them that we could handle this through WSU
               Student Standards and Accountability and they could voluntarily
               destroy their marijuana and paraphernalia, or they could refuse
               and I may complete a search warrant and go from there. Williams
               told me that she wanted to go through Student Conduct and
               retrieved her marijuana and paraphernalia. Solomon told me that
               she was not involved. She stated that she didn't smoke any
               marijuana and she doesn't have any. Williams confirmed that
               Solomon had nothing to do with the odor of marijuana coming
               from their room. I escorted Williams to the dumpster area of
               Rogers Hall where she dumped her marijuana down a storm drain
               and she destroyed her pipe in the dumpster. I explained the
               student conduct process to her and she told me she understood.
               I returned to WSUPD and downloaded my Vievu camera video of the
               contact. Forward to WSU Student Conduct. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               2nd day of September, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.
