               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W3682 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched to the
               Southside Cafe for a report of a theft. Leo J. Gonzales (DOB
               02-15-1996) was contacted and warned for theft. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Leo J. Gonzales / 02-15-1996 Warned
               Theft 2. NARRATIVE: On 09-22-2014 at about 1133 hrs I was
               dispatched to a report of a theft at the Southside Cafe,
               located at 1395 SE Stadium Way. Dispatch advised that an
               individual had been detained at the cafe for attempting to
               steal food. Sergeant Larsen and I arrived on scene and
               contacted the complainant, Brian L. Keithley (DOB 03-05-1960).
               Keithley is the general manager for the Southside Cafe.
               Keithley was with another individual, who was later identified
               as Leo J. Gonzales (DOB 02-15-1996). Keithley stated that at
               about 1115 hrs he was working in the food service area of the
               cafe and observed Gonzales pick up a package containing a
               burger and noodles. Keithley said Gonzales made no attempt to
               pay for the item and began walking out the front doors.
               Keithley said he contacted Gonzales and asked him to come back
               inside to his office, which he did. Keithley said he attempted
               to speak with Gonzales about the situation, but Gonzales would
               not answer his questions. Keithley decided to call the police.
               I asked Gonzales to tell me what happened. Gonzales said he was
               in the cafe and realized he had forgotten to bring his Cougar
               Card. Gonzales said he took the burger and attempted to leave
               without paying for it. Gonzales said he was scared when he was
               contacted by Keithley so he lied. Gonzales said he is a WSU
               student and has an active dining account. Keithley confirmed
               that Gonzales is a WSU student and does have an active dining
               account, which he recently used yesterday evening. Keithley
               considered the circumstances and stated that he did not wish to
               pursue criminal charges against Gonzales. Keithley said he
               would charge Gonzales' dining account for the food he had
               attempted to take. Keithley stated that the value of the burger
               and noodles was $12.00. Keithley said Gonzales was allowed to
               return to the cafe and did not wish to trespass him from the
               premises. Keithley requested that my report be sent to WSU
               Student Conduct. Gonzales was released, and I warned him about
               his behavior. I photographed the burger and noodles, and the
               photograph was downloaded into Spillman I request that this
               report be forwarded to WSU Student Conduct. No further action
               at this time. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the

               2014 at about 1339 hrs I was dispatched to a chemical spill at
               the Animal Disease Biotechnology Facility (ADBF), located at
               1855 NE Grimes Way. Dispatch advised that an unknown liquid had
               leaked onto the ground in room #2048T. I arrived on scene and
               contacted custodial staff members. I saw that room #2048T was a
               storage room, and I observed an amber colored liquid on the
               floor of the room. I told custodial staff to close the door to
               the room, which they did, and to wait for fire department and
               Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) to arrive. Personnel from
               the Pullman Fire Department and EHS arrived on scene and
               evaluated the situation. Their initial assessment was that the
               spilled liquid was not exceptionally hazardous but would need
               to be cleaned up. They advised that an evacuation of the
               building was not necessary and further law enforcement
               assistance was not needed. I cleared the scene. No further
               action at this time. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under

               contacted the complainant, Brittany A. Griffin (DOB 07-26-
               1989). Griffin is the hall director for Stephenson South.
               Griffin said a few minutes ago, she had detected the odor of
               burning marijuana originating from this room. While I was
               speaking with Griffin in the hallway, she pointed out a male
               who was walking towards room #1031. Griffin told me that the
               male was a resident of the room. I contacted the male, who was
               identified as Michael J. Beauchamp (DOB 08-06-1996). I told
               Beauchamp why I had been called to the residence hall and asked
               him if he had been smoking marijuana inside his room. Beauchamp
               said he had just returned to his room about 15 minutes ago and
               had not been smoking marijuana inside his room. Beauchamp said
               that his roommate, later identified as Jann J. Zeta (DOB 08-30-
               1996), was not around. Beauchamp was somewhat uncooperative and
               argumentative and was adamant that he had not been smoking
               marijuana inside his room. Beauchamp made some statement about
               not smoking around here anymore. Beauchamp stated that he had
               just returned to his room, however, Griffin stated that
               Beauchamp had been observed in the building and around his room
               for longer than he was acknowledging. Beauchamp granted me
               consent to enter his room and to search the portions of the
               room under his control. Beauchamp opened the door to his room,
               and I could immediately detect the obvious odor of burning or
               burnt marijuana coming from inside. Beauchamp vigorously denied
               that the odor was that of marijuana. I observed that desk fans
               in the room were turned on, and the window was open. I located
               a blow tube on the shelf above Beauchamp's desk filled with
               dryer sheets. Beauchamp admitted that he had used the tube in
               the past while smoking marijuana. I observed a package of "zig
               zag" papers on Beauchamp's desk. Based on my training and
               experience, all of these observations are consistent with
               someone possessing and/or frequently using marijuana. While
               searching the room, I detected the odor of marijuana

               originating from near the corner of Beauchamp's desk and the
               refrigerator. I continued to search but could not locate the
               source of the odor. Beauchamp stated that there was no
               marijuana inside his room and again stated that he had not
               smoked any marijuana in his room today. At about this time,
               Zeta arrived back at the room. Zeta said he just returned and
               did not have any knowledge of anyone smoking marijuana inside
               the room. This was the third marijuana related incident the
               police department recently handled that involved Beauchamp and
               Zeta. For more information see case numbers 14-W3360 and 14-
               W3382. I warned Beauchamp for his behavior involving marijuana
               and told him that my report would be forwarded to WSU Student
               Conduct. Beauchamp and Zeta are both 18 years old. I cleared
               the scene. I request that this case be forwarded to WSU Student
               Conduct. No further action at this time. Olmstead/339 I certify

               sign. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               09-22-14 I was dispatched to a malicious mischief at the golf
               course. The R/P stated that they had found graffiti on the
               Palouse Ridge Golf Course sign. I responded to the area, but
               found no damage to any of the signs. I contacted the Facilities
               Operations dispatcher for a location and they gave me the same
               sign. I told her that when the maintenance workers go out and
               find the damage to call the police so we can take photos of it.
               She said she would add it to the call. Close this case out as
