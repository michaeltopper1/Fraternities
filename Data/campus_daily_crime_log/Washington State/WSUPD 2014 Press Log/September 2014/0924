               On 9/24/14 at about 0726 hours a burglary alarm for room 19 of
               Beasley Coliseum was received. Sgt Larsen and I responded and
               found the back door of room 19 to be open. The door knob was
               locked on the outside so it is believed the door may have been
               shut but not latched. Nothing in the room appeared to be
               disturbed. The responsible, Leo Udy, was contacted and informed
               of the situation. Udy provided the code to shut off the alarm.
               Udy will notify police if anything is found missing. Nothing
               further at this time. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this ____ day of

               sitting in a chair near the window and was alert, but a little
               quiet. She had two friends with her, Jack Cuneo and Vayda
               Moore. She said that she had taken about five Xanax (for
               anxiety) pills around 1300hrs and two Xanax pills around
               0900hrs. She also said that she had two "gulps" of alcohol
               (possibly Crown) a few hours before our contact. Simmons said
               that she was feeling dizzy and was stumbling a little. Simmons
               indicated that she was sexually assaulted about one week ago
               and wanted to feel less stress and was still dealing with it.
               She told the Pullman Fire Department Medics that she wanted to
               hurt herself. She voluntarily went to PRH to be examined.
               Simmons indicated that she has been seeing a WSU Counselor
               named Kate and that Melynda Huskey was aware of the sexual
               assault. We will have a WSU officer contact Simmons about the
               sexual assault in a few days. MFL/313 I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W3721 SYNOPSIS: Vehicle verses Pedestrian
               accident on Spokane St. at the Campus St. intersection.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               09/24/14 at about 1618 hours Sgt Larsen and I responded to the
               intersection of Spokane St. and Campus St. for a Vehicle verses
               Pedestrian accident. On arrival I found pedestrian, Yujue Wang,
               sitting in the Spokane St. south bound lane near the cross walk
               at the Campus St. intersection. Wa/ALA4142 was parked beside
               Wang in the same south bound lane. Checking on Wang first, he
               tells me he is fine, other than his back was a little sore.
               Wang wanted to get up, but I asked him to stay seated until the
               Medics arrived and checked him out. Wang appeared fine and I
               could not observe any apparent injuries. About this time Sgt.
               Larsen arrived and I asked him to talk to witness Jamie
               Callison, and to take photos of the scene. I asked Wang what
               happened, and he indicated he was crossing Spokane St. in the
               cross walk from west to east when he was struck by the car.
               Wang said he saw the car at the last moment and turned, so the
               front of the vehicle struck his back side pushing him to the
               ground. Wang said the vehicle was not traveling very fast when
               he was struck. The driver of the vehicle was identified as
               Moath Ibrahim A. Aljeraisy, 12/28/95. Moath said as he turned
               left off of Campus St. onto Spokane St. he did not see Wang in
               the cross walk. He then added he believed Wang moved into the
               intersection at a fast speed. Moath also said he was traveling
               at a slow speed when he struck Wang with the front of his
               vehicle. There was no damage to the vehicle Moath was driving.
               Moath provided a Insurance card from State Farm that was water
               stained and the policy number appeared to be 4T1BE30K06U664826.
               Wang was checked by the medics and found to have no apparent
               injuries. Wang was informed if he started to have pains, or
               other symptoms, to seek medical aid right away. Wang said he
               would. Wang was provided the case number and Moath's
               information. Moath was informed that the accident was his fault
               since he failed to yield to a Pedestrian in a crosswalk. Moath
               was told at this time he was only receiving a verbal warning
               and not a citation. He was instructed to obtain a readable
               proof of insurance, and to be more careful when driving. No
               further at this time. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this ____ day of

               hours I contacted Sean A Lebouef because he was having a
               difficult time keeping his balance while walking on the
               sidewalk on Merman dr. He was under 21, had odor of alcohol on
               his breath as he spoke, could not maintain his balance and
               admitted to having been drinking. He was told the case would be
               referred to the PA's office and student conduct and released.

               referred to PA's office MIP 2. NARRATIVE: On 09-24-14 at about
               2025 hours I was on patrol on Merman Dr heading towards Terre
               View from Orchard approaching Chief Joe when the suspect caught
               my attention because his head was down, he was taking unusually
               long strides to maintain his balance as he walked across the
               entrance to the Chief Joe parking lot and he did not appear to
               be over 21 yoa. At the same time was going from one side to the
               other of the sidewalk has he walked. I pulled in behind Terrace
               apartments and drove the intersection of Merman Dr and Garden
               Ave. From this vantage point I saw the suspect still walking
               side to side using the entire width of the sidewalk as he
               walked and he almost bumped into two females as he walked. I
               pulled into the entrance to the Valley Rd Playfields and exited
               my vehicle. I was in full uniform and asked the suspect if I
               could talk to him for a second. He said for a second, and I
               said yes. I told the suspect why I was talking to him and
               explained what I had observed and told him it appeared he was
               under the influence of something. He said, "under the
               influence" and I said yes. As he spoke I could smell the strong
               odor of intoxicants coming from his breath. I asked him how old
               he was and he said 19, then 20. I asked which it was and he
               said 20. I asked if he had any ID and he said no. He identified
               himself as Sean A Lebouef 08-08-1994 and said he had a
               California license. I asked how much he had to drink and he
               said 2 drinks. It was clear he had more than two drinks because
               he was swaying in a circular motion in an attempted to maintain
               he balance, his eyes were droopy and the odor of intoxicants
               was very strong. I told him I didn't believe him and asked him
               to put his feet together, close his eyes and tilt his head
               back. He had to open his eyes, lift one leg and use my car to
               catch himself from falling and I told him that is why I didn't
               believe him. His Id was confirmed through CA. I told him I
               would be forwarding the case to the PA's office and student

               09-24-14 at about 2353 hours I was dispatched to room 116
               Goldsworthy Hall for the report of marijuana in that room.
               According to dispatch, the RP (Jenafer Doolittle) said the
               occupants had marijuana in the room when they were contacted
               for a noise complaint. I met Doolittle in the lobby and she
               said the occupants were aware I was on my way. I arrived at
               room 116 and there were two other hall staff persons in the
               hall whom I did not identify. The door was opened and I stepped
               into the doorway, not crossing the threshold, and introduced
               myself. I was wearing my uniform at the time. I asked them if
               they knew why I was there and they said yes. I could smell the
               odor of burnt marijuana coming from the room. I asked if it was
               okay if I entered the room and each person said yes. Shenk said
               it wasn't his room and I told him he could still say no and he
               said it was okay to come in. I asked how much marijuana was in
               the room and they all indicated a small amount. I asked where
               it was and Mitalas handed me a small container with a trace
               amount of marijuana in it. I asked what they used to smoke it
               and again Mitalas handed me a small clear glass bong. I asked
               if anyone was 21 and they all said no, I asked if anyone had a
               medical marijuana card and they all said no I asked if they had
               been smoking marijuana and they each said yes. I identified
               each of them by their WA drivers license. Each of them said
               they had not been trouble before this contact. I told them the
               plan was to refer each of them to student conduct if they were
               willing to destroy the bong and marijuana. Each agreed to that
               plan. The bong and marijuana were placed in the black plastic
               garbage bag and I walked out with Castro Talavera to the
