               which had 3 credit cards and several purchase receipts clipped

               John R. Morse (10-22-52). I asked Morse to tell me what
               happened. He said his department (USDA Agricultural Research
               Services) is missing a clip board which had 3 credit cards and
               several purchase receipts clipped to it. He said he is still
               gathering details of the events leading to the loss of the clip
               board. I told him I would e-mail the information I needed from
               him to begin my investigation since he didn't have much to go
               on as of the time we spoke. He did say he has already cancelled
               the credit cards and new ones will be issued. He does not know
               if any un-authorized transactions or attempted un-authorized
               transactions were made. I sent to following e-mail to the e-
               mail address Morse provided me (john.morse@ars.usda.gov): Good

               person who was involved. 5. License plate numbers for each
               vehicle involved. 6. Types of Credit Card and Card number for
               each missing card. 7. Details surrounding authorized purchases
               on each card to include date, time, location, amount, and
               description of purchased items. 8. Details surrounding any un-
               authorized purchases or un-authorized attempted purchases to
               include date, time location, amount, description of items. 9.
               Person who was "In Charge" of everything I know it seems like a
               lot of information, but it will all help to try to solve our
               mystery. Please get this information to me as soon as you can.
               As we discussed, I realize some of this may take some time.
               Please filter items to me as soon as they become available and
               do not wait until you have everything together to give me at
               one time. I will add items to the case as I receive them. Thank

               about 1152 hours Pullman Fire and WSU Police were dispatched to
               a fire alarm at Kruegel Hall. I responded to the building.
               Pullman Fire personnel and I were contacted by contract
               construction workers inside the building. They failed to
               evacuate when the alarm sounded. The workers said they caused
               the alarm to activate due to dust. They went on to say someone
               from WSU Capital Planning told them to remove the dust covers
               from the smoke detectors in the areas they were working in.
               Pullman Fire determined there was no fire emergency and the
               alarm was reset. I spoke with WSU Fire Marshal Holmes about the
               incident. No further investigation. I certify and declare under

               that occurred 2-3 weeks ago. Subject was arrested and booked
               into the Whitman County Jail for indecent liberties. Incident
               sent to student conduct and title IX. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Chandler Tran/102495 Arrested Indecent
               Liberties 2. NARRATIVE: On 09/25/14 at about 2049 hrs Dispatch
               advised of a subject reporting a sexual offense that occurred
               approximately 2-3 weeks prior. I contacted the victim, Edilajda
               Cordic (042995), in her RA's room. Cordic told me approximately
               2-3 weeks prior she was going down to the laundry room in
               Streit Hall and as she walked through the lounge area there was
               a male, later identified as Chandler Tran (102495), sitting
               working on homework. Tran asked for assistance on a problem and
               Cordic helped him. Tran asked for her phone number in case he
               had any further questions and she gave it to him. Cordic
               continued on to the laundry room and a short time later Tran
               came in. He asked if she wanted to have sex in the laundry room
               and she initially thought he was joking. She laughed and said
               no. He asked again and she again said no. She asked if he was
               drunk and he said no. Tran closed the door to the laundry room
               and approached Cordic. He grabbed her by the waist and rubbed
               his penis up against her through both their clothing. He asked
               Cordic to give him oral sex and she said no. He asked multiple
               times and she said no each time. Tran walked toward the door as
               if he was going to leave but turned around and pulled his penis
               out of his pants. He tried to get Cordic to look at it but she
               refused. He asked for oral sex again and she refused. He told
               her to just "kiss the tip". She again refused. He approached
               Cordic again and took her by the waist with both hands, backing
               her toward the dryers, while pulling her toward himself. She
               again verbalized no and pushed his hands off her. He again
               grabbed her by the waist and began rubbing his penis on her
               shirt/pants. They were standing face to face at this point and
               Cordic indicated he was rubbing his penis near her stomach. I
               asked if his penis was flaccid or erect and she said somewhere
               in between. She could feel it rubbing on her through her
               clothing. Tran tried to grab Cordic's hand and direct it down
               toward his penis but she pulled her hand away from him. Tran
               told Cordic if she kissed him on the cheek he would leave. She
               did so just to get him to leave. Cordic and Tran both left the
               laundry room at about the same time. Tran told Cordic not to
               tell anyone. This concerned Cordic and made her think he either
               had done it before or might do it again to someone. Cordic told

               me Tran was not violent and did not make any specific threats
               to her. She was in shock as to what was actually occurring so
               the only physical resistance was her pushing him away when he
               grabbed her waist. He was able to overcome that resistance and
               grab her again in the same manner. She was clear that she
               verbalized no several times throughout the encounter. Initially
               Cordic did not know exactly who the suspect was but thought he
               said his name was Christian, or something similar. The RA,
               Maria D. Zuniga Ruiz (051595), was trying to see if there was
               anyone named Christian in Streit/Perham but there was no one by
               that name. As I was speaking with Cordic Zuniga Ruiz was on the
               phone with another hall staff member asking if they knew anyone
               who matched the description of the suspect. She pulled up a
               Facebook profile for a Chandler Tran on her laptop. As soon as
               Cordic saw the picture she said, "that's him" without being
               asked to identify the subject. I asked how sure she was and she
               said 100%. Cordic said she has seen him several times in
               passing in the dorm since the incident and he has tried to
               speak with her but she has tried to avoid him. She said he was
               not threatening and she did not think he was following her and
               the meetings were by chance. I contacted Tran on the phone and
               asked to meet him at his room, 233 Streit. I met with him and
               asked if I could come in to speak with him and he said yes. I
               spoke with him inside his room. I asked Tran if he remembered
               an incident with a girl in the laundry room that occurred 2-3
               weeks prior. He said he was downstairs studying and was quite
               high on marijuana. He said he "probably" asked if she wanted to
               have sex and she said no. I asked if he remembered anything
               else and he said he was pretty high and did not remember
               anything else. I asked if he took his penis out at any time in
               the laundry room and he sighed before saying "probably, I don't
               remember". I told him I was told he took his penis out and
               rubbed it on Cordic. He told me he could not remember "but if
               that's what she said it probably happened". I asked how high he
               was that night on a scale of 1-10 with 10 being the highest hes
               ever been. He said an 8. I asked him again if he could remember
               anything else about what happened and he said no but whatever
               Cordic said was probably what happened. I made it clear to Tran
               that Cordic did not want to speak with him or be contacted by
               him in any way and he said he understood. I told Tran he was
               under arrest for indecent liberties and placed him in handcuffs
               (double locked). I advised him of his right to remain silent
               and his right to an attorney. Once we were out of the residence
               I activated my body camera and advised Tran he was being
               recorded. I transported him to the Pullman Police Department
               holding facility. I later returned to transport Tran to the
               Whitman County Jail. As I was putting Tran in the transport
               belt he began making comments regarding how high he was that
               night. I stopped him, made sure he was aware he was being
               recorded, and read him his Constitutional Rights from a pre
               printed card. He said he understood his rights and verbally
               waived his rights. Tran told me he met some guys he didn't know
               the night of the incident. He said they asked if he wanted to
               get high with them so they went to smoke marijuana. He said the
               high he got from the marijuana was weird. He could not describe

               it other than to say it was strange and unlike any marijuana he
               smoked before. He said he could remember meeting Cordic at the
               laundry room but did not remember what happened. He said the
               next morning he woke up his his room and had a feeling
               something happened but he didn't know what. He said he
               contacted Cordic and apologized because he was not sure what
               happened. I transported Tran to the Whitman County for booking.
