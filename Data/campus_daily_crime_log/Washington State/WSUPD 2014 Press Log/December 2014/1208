    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Olmstead/339 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W5162 SYNOPSIS: Matthew H. Reynolds (DOB
               07-19-1996) reported a parking problem. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 12-08-2014 at about 1022 hrs I
               was dispatched to a report of a parking problem in the Blue Lot
               #1, located near the Chinook Apartments. I contacted the
               complainant, Matthew H. Reynolds (DOB 07-19-1996), on the
               telephone. Reynolds reported that on 12-04-2014 he parked his
               white, 2007 Chrysler PT Cruiser (WA Lic. 791XCD) in the Blue
               Lot #1 parking lot. He later returned to his vehicle and
               discovered that it had slid on the ice. Reynolds stated that no
               damage was caused by the movement of his vehicle, and it did
               not make contact with any other vehicle in the parking lot,
               however, his vehicle was now positioned in a manner that he
               could not move it. Reynolds stated that if a neighboring
               vehicle was moved, then he would be able to move his vehicle.
               The neighboring vehicle was identified as a orange, 2008 Suzuki
               SX4 (WA Lic. ACN0884). Reynolds requested assistance in
               contacting the owner of the neighboring vehicle so that they
               could be asked to move their vehicle. Reynolds advised that
               prior to me contacting him, he had contacted WSU Parking
               Services. WSU Parking Services had already contacted the owner
               of the other vehicle and requested that it be moved. Reynolds
               advised that no further police assistance was needed. No
               further action at this time. Olmtead/339 I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of

               broken and stolen from complainants room while she was out of
               town. Investigation continues. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: ON 12-08-14 at about 1240 hours I
               was dispatched to the report of a civil issue. Emma L.
               Straazaldson was requesting phone contact regarding issues she
               was having with her roommate, Alexandra Croney. I called
               Straazaldson and asked her what was going on. She explained to
               me that she had gone home over the weekend and while she was
               away her roommate, Croney, held a party at their apartment. She
               said that when she got home last night she found her room
               trashed. Straazaldson told me that her desk chair was flipped
               over, her bed was messed up, the closet door was broken, two
               posters were ripped, a handmade Advent calendar was damaged as
               well as items missing from it, her hair towel and soap were
               missing from her bathroom and some of her laundry money was
               missing from her desk drawer. She told me she did not know how
               much money was missing because there was just a pile of
               quarters, which are now almost gone. She explained that her
               room was a disaster and that all of her drawers were ransacked.
               She explained that she has lived with Croney since August 2014
               and that since then Croney has had a few parties, which
               Straazaldson does not approve of. She said she tried talked to
               Croney about the condition she found her room and all she will
               say is that it "isn't her problem". Straazaldson told me that
               Croney is now ignoring her. I asked Straazaldson if there would
               be any reason for Croney to treat her like this and she thinks
               it has something to do with Croney's boyfriend, Louis.
               Straazaldson told me that she doesn't really like Louis and she
               thinks that he and his roommates are responsible for the
               damaged and missing items, though she has no proof, just
               speculation. Straazaldson also told me she plans on moving out
               at the end of this semester. She also told me that she has
               cleaned her room but took pictures before she did. I asked
               Straazaldson to email those to me. After ending my call with
               Straazaldson I attempted contact with Croney. She did not
               answer and I was unable to leave a voicemail. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W5175 SYNOPSIS: Dispatched to a
               suspicious call at the Daggy parking garage. Two males lifted a
               concrete bollard off of the metal post it was secured to. I
               responded and there was no one in the area. The bollard was off
               of the metal post and laying on the ground. Facilities was not
               able to respond right away, so we moved the bollard and placed
               a traffic cone on the metal post. No suspects, no leads.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               12/08/14 at about 1658 hours I was dispatched to a suspicious
               call at the Daggy parking garage. Two males reportedly lifted a
               concrete bollard off of the metal post it was secured to the
               ground with. When I arrived there was no one in the area. The
               bollard was off of the metal post and laying on the ground. I
               called the reporting party Tyler M. Strom (DOB 070686) and
               asked him what he saw. He said he saw two males lift the
               bollard off of the metal post. Strom said as they walked away
               down the parking ramp he rolled down his window and asked what
               they were doing. One of the males stopped and talked to him
               while the other continued on. The male that stopped and talked
               told Strom it was the other male that did it. The male that had
               gone ahead yelled to the other calling him "Jose". Both males
               got in a dark SUV parked on College Street and drove away.
               Strom had no further information. Facilities was not able to
               respond right away, so we moved the bollard out of the way near
               the dumpster and placed a traffic cone on the metal post.
