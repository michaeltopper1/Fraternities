    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: JAK/333 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W5420 SYNOPSIS: A person, who only
               identified himself as Brian with Bank Of America Security,
               wanted me to unlock the CUB so a technician could check the
               Bank of America ATM. Brian refused to identify himself so I
               could include it in the report so I told him I would not be
               able to unlock the CUB. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               2. NARRATIVE: On 12-28-14, Whitcom asked me to call them.
               Whitcom advised they had someone named Brian on the phone
               stating he was with the Security department of Bank of America.
               Brian advised the security center had "Lost Connection" with
               their ATM which is located in the Compton Union Building on the
               Washington State University campus in Pullman, Washington. I
               advised Whitcom the CUB was closed and had been since Christmas
               day. Whitcom said she would advise Brian and would have what I
               relayed. A short time later, Whitcom advised Brian would like a
               phone call from me. At 1111 hours, I called 1-800-677-6052,
               then pressed 4 & 2 as instructed by Whitcom. I asked for Brian
               and was placed on hold. When a male answered he said his name
               was Brian. I asked him what I could do for him. He advised the
               Bank of America Security Office "Lost Connection" with their
               ATM which is located in the CUB on 12-27-14 at approximately
               2212 hours. He went on to say the "Lost Connection"
               notification was not like a "Burglary Alarm". He said the "Lost
               Connection" was manually "Dispatched" at approximately 0500
               hours on 12-28-14. I advised him I only became aware of the
               inquiry at approximately 1100 hour 12-28-14. He went on to say
               even though it was manually "Dispatched" at approximately 0500
               hours, the security office likes to take local time into
               account and only informed technician's of the issues during
               "Working hours". I asked Brian what I could do for him. He said
               he would like someone to unlock the CUB to allow his technician
               into the building to inspect their ATM. He said the technician
               is out of Spokane, Washington and was over an hour away. I told
               him as long as I could verify the identity of who I was dealing
               with I would be able to help them out. I asked Brian if he had
               a middle initial of name and he hesitated and said "B". I asked
               him how he spelled his last name. He again hesitated and slowly
               said his last name was Watson. I asked for his date of birth
               and he said something to the effect of "This is a lot of
               information". I explained the reason for the questions was so I
               could "Run" and "Attach" him to the call so I had a record or
               who I was dealing with. He said something to the effect of "I
               don't know who you are and am not comfortable giving you that

               information. I told him I understood, but explained I also
               didn't know him or who I was dealing with. I explained I
               obtained the same information from every person I deal with so
               I have a record of who I have dealt with. I gave him a scenario
               of me allowing someone into the CUB under the guise of him
               being a technician and stealing money. I explained if I did not
               have a record of who I dealt with I could get in a lot of
               trouble. He said he understood, but was still unwilling to
               provide me with the information I requested. I told him since
               he was unwilling to provide me with his identifying
               information, I would not be able to unlock the CUB. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 28th day of December, 2014, in Pullman,

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W5425 SYNOPSIS: Crowley cited and
               released for violation of a TRIP permit. Crowley was also
               issued NOI's for switching a valid license plate onto his
               unregistered truck. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               William Dakota Crowley 04/20/94 Cited/Released TRIP Violation
               4Z1119760 2. NARRATIVE: On 12/28/14 at approximately 2216 hours
               I was driving westbound on Stadium Way near Lybecker Street
               when I noticed a blue Ford pickup truck heading eastbound on
               Stadium Way near Lake Street. The truck appeared to be
               traveling faster than the posted 30 MPH zone. I activated my in
               car radar (vehicle 38) and obtained a reading of 39 MPH. As
               soon as the truck passed me I turned around and initiated a
               traffic stop at Stadium Way and Streit Hall. At the time of the
               stop the roadway was slick due to a thick layer of ice and
               snow. The license plate was unreadable due to snow covering the
               plate. I contacted the driver, William Dakota Crowley 04/20/94,
               informed him I was recording, and explained the reason for the
               stop. I asked Crowley for his driver's license which he
               provided. Crowley said he had just brought up his truck from
               California and he only had a trip permit. I noticed a trip
               permit in the window that had the date of 11/2014 on it. I
               asked Crowley for his insurance and he said he did not have any
               on his truck. Something did not seem right about the situation
               so I ran the truck's VIN number and the license plate that was
               attached to the truck. I also ran Crowley through dispatch.
               Once at my patrol car dispatch stated that Crowley was clear,
               however the license plate and VIN number did not match. The
               license plate returned to a 1997 Chevy Blazer and the VIN
               returned to a 1992 Ford F150. I returned to Crowley and asked
               what was going on with his license plates. Crowley said he
               would be honest with me and provided the following story.
               Crowley had bought the truck in Montana but he was living in
               California. Crowley could not get the truck to pass
               California's emissions test so the truck was not registered.
               Crowley recently moved to Pullman to live with his girlfriend.
               Crowley's girlfriend owns a 1997 Chevy Blazer that is not
               running right now. Crowley and his girlfriend decided to take
               the license plates off her Blazer and put them on Crowley's
               truck so he could drive around. Crowley said his girlfriend was
               on the phone and would verify his story. Crowley handed me his
               cell phone and Crowley's girlfriend identified herself as
               Samantha Nicole Burns 08/03/96. Burns confirmed Crowley's story
               and was able to describe her Blazer and provided me with

               Crowley's full legal name. Burns told me that she had told
               Crowley to take her license plates. After speaking with Burns I
               told Crowley to remain in his truck. I returned to my patrol
               car and started a Sector citation. I filled out a Sector
               criminal citation for RCW 46.16A.320.6 TRIP permit violation. I
               also filled out two NOI's for RCW 46.30.020 no insurance and
               RCW 46.16A.200.7E transfer plate without application. I
               returned to Crowley and explained that he had been technically
               arrested but I was only issuing him a criminal citation as well
               as two traffic citations. I explained the citations and
               provided Crowley with his copies. The license plates were
               removed from the truck and seized so they could be sent to the
               DOL as the statute requires. I told Crowley that he could drive
               his truck to his house where it needed to stay until he
               registered his truck. I followed Crowley to the Blue 1 overflow
               lot where he parked next to the Chevy Blazer. I reminded
               Crowley not to drive the truck until it was registered
               otherwise he could be arrested again. Crowley stated he
               understood. END OF REPORT I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 29th day of December,
               2014, in Pullman, Washington.
