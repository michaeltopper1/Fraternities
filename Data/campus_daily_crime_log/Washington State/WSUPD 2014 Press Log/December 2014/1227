               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Huang, He Yan/062279 Arrested/Booked Violation
               of Anti-Harassment Order 2. NARRATIVE: On 12/27/14 at about
               1606 hours I was dispatched to a possible anti-harassment order
               violation at Sloan Hall. I responded and spoke with the
               reporting party, who was also the petitioner on the order, Eric
               S. Wang (061766). Wang said he was washing vegetables in the
               kitchen in Sloan Hall. He said he returned to his office, 334
               Sloan Hall, from the kitchen and the respondent He Yan Huang
               (062279) was at the door. He told her that she was not supposed
               to be there. He said that Huang backed up away from his office.
               Wang then called dispatch. He said when she saw him get on the
               phone she left. Wang also told me that Huang had contacted him
               by phone on 12/18/14. Wang looked up the call on his phone and
               said it was made at 1254 hours on 12/18/14 from #(408)421-5993.
               This is the phone number listed in Huang's Spillman file. Wang
               said that Huang identified herself and he recognized her voice.
               He told her that he did not want contact from her and told her
               not to call him and then he ended the call. Officer Petlovany
               contacted the Huang, she was at the corner of Spokane St and
               College St. When I finished speaking to Wang I went to Officer
               Petlovany's location. I contacted Pullman Police Department,
               who has the anti-harassment order (AH0117Y13) and confirmed
               that it was still valid and that it was served. The order
               states; Respondent did not appear. The restraint provisions in
               this order are the same as those in the temporary order. The
               court is satisfied that the respondent was personally served
               with the temporary order. Further service is not required. I
               talked to Huang she said that she was at Wang's office. She
               believed that the order had expired. She also confirmed that
               she had called Wang on 12/18/14. Huang confirmed that she was
               served anti-harassment order paperwork by Moscow Police
               Department in early March of 2013. The conditions in the order
               restrain Huang from going within 500 feet of Wang's place of
               employment, or from having any contact with Wang in any way
               including phone calls. I place Huang under arrest for violation
               of an anti-harassment order, handcuffed (DL), advised her she
               was being audio and video recorded, read her Miranda warnings,
               and searched her incident to arrest. Officer Olmstead
               transported her to Whitman County Jail for booking. Nothing
