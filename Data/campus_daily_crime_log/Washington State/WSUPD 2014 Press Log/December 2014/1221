               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W5376 SYNOPSIS: WSUPD assisted PPD with a
               burglary alarm case at Cougs Corner Mart. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 12/22/14 at
               approximately 0147 hours, Ofc. Winegardner requested a WSUPD
               Officer to respond to Cougs Corner Mart where he was
               investigating a burglary alarm. Ofc. Winegardner stated as he
               pulled up to the store a grey Ford F150 left the parking lot.
               Ofc. Winegardner provided the license plate of X279WSU and
               asked if it was found to stop it and identify the driver. A few
               moments later I located the truck on Merman Drive heading
               northbound. The truck pulled into the Cedar Ridge apartment
               complex. When the truck came to a stop I walked up to the
               driver who rolled down his window and asked for directions. I
               asked the driver, later identified as Matthew Patrick Sexton
               12/09/93, why he was at the Cougs Corner Mart. Sexton stated he
               had pulled into the lot to look up directions for a football
               player. Sexton said that he was responsible for taking 3
               football players up to Spokane's airport so they could make
               their flights. I ran Sexton's information and he came back
               clear. I noticed there were several WSU athletics bags in the
               bed of the pickup. I relayed the story that Sexton had provided
               to Ofc. Winegardner and I was informed that Sexton could be let
               go. I returned to Sexton and told him that he was free to
               leave. I cleared shortly there after. END OF REPORT I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.
               Dated this 22nd day of December, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.
