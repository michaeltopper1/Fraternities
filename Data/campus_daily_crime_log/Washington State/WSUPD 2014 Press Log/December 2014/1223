    Narrative: RVWD: 316 / OFC: Edwards/330 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W5389 SYNOPSIS: Report of the traffic
               light not working at the intersection of Stadium Way and
               Nevada. I provided traffic control until temporary stop signs
               were put up. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 12-23-14 at about 0900 hours I noticed on my MDC
               that there was a traffic hazard call at the intersection of
               Stadium Way and Nevada. I look at the call comments and saw
               that FacOps was requesting an officer check the intersection to
               see if the traffic light was operational, since a transformer
               had blown. I responded to the intersection and saw that it was
               not functioning. I provided traffic control until temporary
               stop signs were placed at the intersection. I noticed that
               around 1100 hours the traffic light was functioning properly
               and the stop signs had been removed. Nothing further. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.
               Dated this 23rd day of December, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Edwards/330 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W5392 SYNOPSIS: Report of a fraudulent
               WSU Payroll check. Under investigation. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 12-23-14 at about 1038 hours I
               was dispatched to the report of a bad check. Whitcom advised
               that the RP was in the WSUPD lobby. I contacted WSU Payroll
               employee Robert Wright. R. Wright explained to me that Bank of
               America (BofA) contacted payroll about a suspicious check. R.
               Wright showed a copy of the check to me along with the original
               check information. WSU check number V185765 was issued to Jared
               B. Kavanaugh, 2331 W. Sinto Ave. Spokane, WA 99201 in the
               amount of $478.12 on 12/12/14. I could see that a copy of the
               check from BofA now said that WSU check number V185765 was now
               issued to Amber Wright, 2008 Rowan, Spokane, WA 99207 in the
               amount of $1982.00. R. Wright explained to me that BofA
               contacted Payroll Services because the check was flagged in the
               "positive pay" system. The Positive Pay system is used to cross
               reference the check number, issue date and amount of WSU checks
               as they come in. R. Wright explained that this check was
               flagged because the amount on the check presented to BofA did
               not match what had been reported by WSU. R. Wright explained
               that when a check is flagged in the positive pay system,
               payroll services automatically gets a message with a copy of
               the check presented to the bank so they can look into the
               problem. R. Wright told BofA that the check had been altered
               and to not complete the transaction. He then brought a copy of
               the check to WSUPD. The check was not cashed or deposited into
               anybody's account. WSU has not lost any money at this point. I
               then contacted Jared B. Kavanaugh to ask him about the check,
               which was supposed to be a reimbursement of travel expenses. I
               called him and left a voicemail requesting a call back. At
               about 1300 hours I spoke to Kavanaugh. I asked him if he had
               received his reimbursement check from WSU from his travels to
               Scottsdale, Az in October. He said no, he was still waiting for
               his check. I asked him what the amount should be and he said
               "just under $500.00". I asked Jared if he knows who "Amber
               Wright" is. He said the name sounded familiar but was not sure.
               I asked him if his current address is on Sinto Ave. He said
               yes. I asked him if "Rowan St" is near Sinto. He said he was
               not positive but thought it may be close. I asked Kavanaugh to
               call me if he was able to offer any other information about
               Amber. He said he would. I also advised Kavanaugh to contact
               WSU so he could have a check re-issued to him. After ending my
               call with Kavanaugh I used DAPS to search for "Amber Wright"

               with a zip code of "99207". There was one matching driver
               record found. I saw Amber Lea Wright (04-17-81) lives at 2008
               E. Rowan Ave Spokane, WA 99207. I asked Whitcom to run a III on
               A. Wright, which was later received. I called R. Wright back to
               ask if he knew which BofA branch in Spokane the check was taken
               to. He said he did not know, but Karen Kellerman might be able
               to help. Kellerman works directly with BofA on behalf of WSU. I
               called Kellerman and left her a voicemail asking her to return
               my call. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this ____ day of _____________, 2014, in

               inside a carrier. The RP, Margo Buckley, is a custodian for the
               building and stated she thought the female may be suffering
               from a mental illness. Officer Jones and I responded to the
               area. Buckley showed us to the staff lounge where the female
               was resting. I contacted the female, later identified by her
               Arizona driver's license as Allyson A. Wolf. I asked Wolf how
               she was doing and she said she was fine. I asked her what she
               was doing in the building and she said she was working on
               something. I told Wolf the building did not open until 7:30 and
               she apologized and said she thought it was already open. Wolf
               spoke with a british accent and very soft, to the point where I
               could hardly hear her. I asked her if she was staff or a
               student and she did not have a clear answer. I asked Wold where
               she lived and she said Stephenson. When asked which tower, she
               said "the first one". I told Wolf that that the residence halls
               were open during break and that if she really lived there then
               she could go to her dorm room. She said she did not know that
               and must have misunderstood. I told Wolf that I did not believe
               her and asked if I could help her. She said she was fine and
               that she was waiting for a friend. Wold did not seem interested
               in talking to me and kept trying to leave. Before Wolf walked
               out I explained to her that if she is found in any building on
               campus that is closed she could be arrested for trespassing.
               She stated she understood then walked out. Throughout my
               contact with Wolf her cat was meowing but she refused to let us
               see the cat or tell us anything about it. Wolf seemed oriented
               to time and place. I later checked the WSU system to see if
               Wolf is actually invovled with the University. She is not
               listed as student, staff or faculty. She also does not have an
               address listed as living in a residence hall and the last
               academic record is from the Spring 2010 semester. Warned for
               trespassing. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 24th day of
               December, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.
