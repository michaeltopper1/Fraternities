               Request for a welfare check. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 12-16-14 at about 0901 hours I
               was dispatched to the report of a welfare check. The RP,
               Cynthia Spiller, was calling requesting we check on her
               daughter, Alanna Spiller. Cynthia told Whitcom that she last
               talked to her daughter on September 3, 2014. She then said
               something about her daughter being away from Campus for 9 days
               and going to the "west side" for Thanksgiving break. Cynthia
               also said that her daughter has told her to never call her
               again. Cynthia thinks that Alanna is in a cult. I tried to call
               Cynthia to gather more information about the situation. She did
               not answer and I could not leave a message. I saw that Cynthia
               has made the exact same complaint to WSUPD on 10-17-14 and 11-
               14-14. In both of those cases the officers made contact with
               Alanna who expressed that she is fine and does not want contact
               with her mother. I then tried to go to Alanna's residence at
               Stevens Hall room 309. She was not home. I tried to call Alanna
               but she did not answer. I left her a voicemail asking her to
               either call me back or come to the police department to talk to
               me. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the
               laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this ____ day of _____________, 2014, in
