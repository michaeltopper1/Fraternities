               Jackson Hall for a distraught female. Assistance provided.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               December 11, 2014 at about 0858 hours I was dispatched to a
               distraught female at Jackson Hall. Cpl. Edwards and I responded
               to the building. WSU Facilities Operations workers took us to
               the female who was sitting in a TV control room crying. The
               female was later identified as Candice Baltz. Baltz asked to go
               to another room where she could speak privately with us. We
               walked down the hall to an empty room. Baltz said she just
               passed a man in the stairwell who has been told to stay away
               from her. Baltz was going up the stairwell in Jackson Hall when
               a man came down the stairs. She thought this encounter was
               accidental although it scared her. She said he did not say
               anything or touch her, he just passed her in the stairwell.
               Baltz identified the man as Wayne Popeski. She told Cpl.
               Edwards and I about the Popeski's behavior towards her in the
               past year. This included a trespass order issued and rescinded
               by WSU as well as her attempt to get an anti harassment order
               issued. Baltz has made complaints to WSU including Human
               Resource Services and The Office of Equality. According to
               Baltz, Popeski has been instructed by WSU Officials to not make
               contact with her and stay away from her work areas. She has had
               no contact with him since around September 2014. They both work
               in Murrow but on different floors in different departments. Cpl
               Edwards checked with Whitcom and determined there were no
               orders in place between Baltz and Popeski. Popeski was not on
               scene when we arrived. He was not contacted by police. The
               encounter with Popeski obviously scared Baltz. She was crying
               and visibly upset when speaking about the incident. Cpl Edwards
               and I were on scene with Baltz for about an hour before she was
               calm enough to leave the room. I provided Baltz a courtesy
               transport to the Dean of Students Office in French
               Administration. Her direct supervisor is the Dean of Students.
               Cpl. Edwards and I met with Baltz and her supervisor, Melinda
               Huskey. We explained the incident to Huskey. She thanked us for
               the assistance and told us that Baltz will go to Human Resource
               Services to document the incident. Assistance was provided, no
               further investigation at this time. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 11th day of
               December, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               Jerome/02-06-96 Warned Possession of Marijuana < 40grams 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 12-11-14 at about 1238 hours I was dispatched to
               a report of drugs at Olympia Hall room 223. The RP, Britteny
               Alspach, is the RED for Olympia Hall and was requesting phone
               contact. I called Alspach and she told me the following; She
               said resident Hailey Hosler had come to her with concerns over
               her roommate, Madeline Jerome, and possible drug use. Hosler
               explained that Jerome always comes home smelling like marijuana
               and she does not like it or want to be a part of it. Hosler
               said that there is never any drug use in the room but Jerome
               will leave, smoke marijuana, then come home. Hosler was
               concerned she would get into trouble if she was home and the
               room smelled like marijuana. She was seeking advice on what to
               do. Alspach said she was not sure what to do in this situation
               because she could not currently smell the odor of marijuana
               emitting from the room. I explained to Alspach that if the odor
               of marijuana is detected then she should call the police. I
               also told her that she could tell Hosler to call if she felt
               like she needed to. I asked about the living situation of
               Hosler and Jerome for next semester and Alspach told me that
               Hosler already has plans to move after this semester ends. She
               said she just needed to know what to do for the next week. I
               told Alspach to continue to follow the protocal for reporting
               drugs. She stated she understood. I also told her this would be
               documented in case there was something that happened in the
               next week. No crimes occurred, documentation/information only.
               I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws
               of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 11th day of December, 2014, in Pullman,

               contacted the complainant/victim Katelyn J. Frederick
               (11/14/94). Frederick told me she had a class in Webster 116
               earlier today and may have left her phone in the room.
               Frederick's class was from 1200 to 1230 hours. She checked with

               phone. In this general area there are sororities and a church.
               Frederick has sent the phone a message stating it was lost and
               to call her friend's number. The phone is described as: MAKE:

               statement over the elevator intercom. Student Conduct. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Alycia C. Bellisle (010796)
               Student Conduct False Reporting RCW 9A.84.040 2. NARRATIVE: On
               121114 at approximately 1756 hours I was dispatched to the
               report of someone making evacuation statements over the
               elevator intercom at Rogers Hall. I responded and spoke with
               Asst. Hall Director Roemeling. Roemeling stated he had gotten
               on the elevator and heard something to the effect of him
               needing to evacuate the elevator and that he was going to die.
               He provided me with a note that RA Kendra A. Morscheck (020496)
               had written. Morscheck had apparently been in the other
               elevator and heard the entire broadcast. The note read
               "everybody evacuate. You are all going to die. You are going to
               die, say the lords prayers now". I then spoke with Morscheck on
               the phone. Morscheck said she heard the voice on the intercom
               she said she recognized the voice as that of Alycia C. Bellisle
               (010796). On a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being most sure that the
               voice was that of Bellisle, she said she was a 9.99 and not a
               10 because she was not looking at her. When Morscheck got to
               the 1st floor elevator lobby, Bellisle was there with 2 other
               girls. I confirmed with Morscheck that she perceived this to be
               a bad joke and not a threat. She initially said she was
               concerned as it sounded like an official announcement but then
               the tone changed to less professional. I then went to
               Bellisle's room on the 8th floor and ran into the 2 girls who
               had been with Bellisle. They were Grecia Valladares (091795)
               and Stacia L. Winchester (080496). At first they were hesitant
               to tell me what happened, but they confirmed that Bellisle had
               activated the intercom and stated it needed to be evacuated.
               They did not recall anything about dying but something about
               praying. I provided them with my business card with the number
               to dispatch. I requested they give it to Bellisle when they saw
               her next. I cleared but later Bellisle called me and I returned
               to meet her at the Rogers Lobby. Bellisle admitted to using the
               intercom and stating it needed to be evacuated but as a joke.
               She said she did not mention dying. Bellisle stated that no one
               had told her she could not use the elevator intercom for this
               purpose, though she acknowledged it was for emergency use only.
               Bellisle was very upset with Morscheck as she felt she had
               called the Police and they were in the same business
               fraternity. She felt Morscheck should have covered for her. I
               explained that as an RA, Morscheck had more responsibilities

               and liabilities that Bellisle was not seeing. Bellisle felt
               Morscheck reported the event up the chain of command due to
               Bellisle not getting along with a friend of Morscheck's,
               another RA. I warned Bellisle about any retaliation. I cleared.
               Bellisle later called me and stated she had spoken with her
               friends and felt that Morscheck was lying about what had been
               broadcast. Bellisle wanted to make sure that was noted in the
               report. I told her she could email me her statement of exactly
               what she felt she had said and I would put it in the report.
               She said she would do so immediately. As of 0045 hours on
               121214 she has not. Neither Roemling or Morscheck stated they
               felt the need to exit the elevator based on what they heard.
               Case closed. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 12th day of December, 2014, in

               Alysia D. Nikas warned for being in the room 4. Maura L. Yanes
               warned for being in the room NARRATIVE: On 12-11-14 at
               approximately 1812 hours, I responded to Stephenson North room
               1209 for the report of the odor of marijuana. Hall Staff
               advised they could clearly smell it emitting from the room. I
               smelled the crack of the door, but could not smell the odor of
               marijuana. Hall staff also stated they heard what sounded like
               duck tape being applied to the door. Based on the statement of
               the hall staff, I knocked on the door. A male, later identified
               as Collin Graham answered the door. As he did, I could hear
               what sounded like tape peeling away from the door. I advised
               him I was there for the report of the odor of marijuana
               emitting from the room. He at first denied it, but when I asked
               him to be honest with me, he admitted to having marijuana in
               the room. I asked him to retrieve the marijuana and items used
               to ingest it and bring it to the hallway and he stated he
               would. I also asked him to have everyone in the room step out
               into the hallway with their identification. Standing in the
               hallway, I could see there was a blanket taped over the alcove
               to the door. Collin returned with about 1/4 ounce of marijuana
               in a yellow small Pelican case, and glass bong. Three other
               people exited the room and all four provided me with their WA
               Driver's Licenses. I confirmed they were all under the age of
               twenty one and none of them were medical marijuana patients.
               The other three were identified as Christopher J. McBride,
               Maura L. Yanes, and Alysia D. Nikas. I asked who the residents
               of the room were and Collin and Christopher stated it was
               theirs. I asked who the marijuana belonged to and Collin stated
               it was his. I asked the other three if they had been smoking
               with Collin and they said no. I did not see any signs of
               impairment with them. Collin admitted he had smoked earlier in
               the room. I asked Christopher and Collin if they would be
               willing to allow me to enter their room and look around and
               they said yes. The three of us went into the room and Collin
               stated he had forgotten to get an item to turn over. He opened
               a drawer and inside of it was a gravity bong and a butane torch
               type cylinder. I advised him he was not allowed to have the
               cylinder in the halls and he stated he would remove it. While

               They stated they understood. Alysia and Maura were also
               provided the same information. Collin grabbed the items he had
               brought out and we went downstairs to the dumpsters where all
               the items were destroyed. Inside the Pelican case with the
               marijuana was a metal grinder which was also destroyed. During
               my contact with all four subjects, they were very polite and
               cooperative. I provided Hall Staff with the information they
               needed and I cleared. I did not handle any of the items. Refer
               all four to Student Conduct. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 12th day of
               December, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 121114 at
               approximately 2000 hours I was at the CUB when I was dispatched
               to a Lockout. At the same time an unidentified patron brought a
               $100 bill up to CUB Staff informing them he had found it near
               Subway. I asked CUB Staff to check with the vendors to see if
               they were short on their counts and that I would return after
               the lockout. When I returned CUB Staff said the vendors had not
               reported missing anything. So I created this case and then
               Jenisha K. Gerard (021695) from Subway came to the front desk
               and said they had done a full count and were off by
               approximately $102. She stated they are generally off by $1-$2
               but not $100. I gave her the money and cleared. Nothing
               follows. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 12th day of December, 2014, in Pullman,

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W5233 SYNOPSIS: Report of marijuana
               emitting from room 205 Streit Hall. Resident of the room and
               visitors observed hall staff calling and fled the room prior to
               arrival. Refer to Student Conduct. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Daquawn D. Brown/08-22-95 Refer to Student
               Conduct 2. NARRATIVE: On 12-11-14 at approximately 2332 hours,
               I was dispatched to Streit Hall for the odor of marijuana
               emitting from room 205 and possibly room 207. I responded and
               contacted Hall Staff who stated that while they were calling in
               the incident, the resident of the room, Daquawn Brown and
               several others fled the room, running down the west stairwell.
               I walked down the hall towards the two rooms and as I
               approached them, I could smell the odor of marijuana in the
               hallway. As I was passing room 207, the resident exited leaving
               his door open. I observed there was no odor of marijuana
               emitting from that room. As I got closer to 205, I observed the
               odor of marijuana became stronger. I put my nose to the door
               cracks of room 205 and observed an overwhelming odor of
               marijuana emitting from the room. I knocked on the door and as
               I did, the door rattled in the door frame, moving back and
               forth. As it did this, air was pushed from the room into the
               hallway and I observed the odor of marijuana emitting from the
               room become even stronger. I knocked several times, but there
               was no answer. I could see the name Daquawn on a piece of paper
               attached to the door. I verified the resident of the room was
               Daquawn D. Brown/08-22-95. The RA stated Brown has a roommate,
               but he is never in the room and had not been seen tonight. I
               advised Hall Staff I would document the incident and refer it
               to Student Conduct. Ofc. Petlovany contacted Bill Stevens to
               advise him of the incident. Refer to Student Conduct. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.

               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 12/12/14 at about 0255
               hrs Dispatch advised of a female who was reportedly feeling
               sick. She advised she had too much alcohol to drink and was
               having some stomach pain. I responded and contacted the female,
               who was not identified because I wrongly assumed that as the
               complainant Dispatch had already done so. She was coherent,
               alert, and appeared to be only slightly intoxicated. She did
               not appear to be in need of medical attention. She told me she
               had a normal amount of alcohol for her, approximately 6 shots.
               She said she was having some stomach pain and she thought this
               was unusual so she was concerned. Pullman ambulance responded
               and transported her to the hospital at her request. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
