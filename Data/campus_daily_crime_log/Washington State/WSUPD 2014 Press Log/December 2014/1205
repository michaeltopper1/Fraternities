               Assault 4th (11/11/95) 2. NARRATIVE: On December 5, 2014 at
               about 1627 hours I was dispatched to the lobby of the WSU
               Police Department to regarding an escort and a physical
               domestic that occurred earlier in the day at Gannon Hall. I
               responded to the lobby where I contacted the complainant/victim
               David Valdez-Lazo (07/03/96). Valdez-Lazo and I went into the
               interview room located off of the WSUPD lobby. Valdez-Lazo told
               me that he is scared and threatened by his girlfriend,
               Guadalupe Vicente Dominguez (11/11/95). He was involved in a
               physical domestic dispute with her in his Gannon Hall room
               earlier today at about 1130 hours. He has been in a dating
               relationship with Vicente Dominguez for about five (5) years.
               Valdez-Lazo told me he was trying to study for an exam. His
               girlfriend wanted to have sex and sat on his lap as he sat at
               his desk studying. Valdez-Lazo told her "No" he didn't want to
               have sex, because he needed to study and pushed her off his
               lap. This upset Vicente Dominguez. She grabbed his notes,
               wadded them up and threw them into the recycle container. She
               then deleted all of his class notes from his laptop computer
               that was sitting on his desk. Vicente Dominguez next took his
               cell phone and put it into her jacket pocket. He had no way to
               call for help as it was the only phone in the room however
               Valdez-Lazo did not attempt to call 911. Valdez-Lazo and
               Vicente Dominguez both grabbed for Valdez-Lazo laptop which was
               sitting on his desk. He pulled the laptop away from her and she
               fell back hitting her head on a bed. Vicente Dominguez got up
               and attacked Valdez-Lazo. She hit, bit, and scratched him.
               Valdez-Lazo showed me scratch and bite marks on his arms and
               hands. I photographed his injuries, he did not require medical
               attention. During the altercation Vicente Dominguez threw a
               hair straightening iron and glass jar of fruit at Valdez-Lazo.
               He was not hit by the items. Valdez-Lazo bear hugged Vicente
               Dominguez in an attempt to get her to calm down and stop
               fighting. He tried to get her out in the hallway but she went
               back into his dorm room. He told me that she tried to lock the
               security chain on the door When she went back into the room
               Vicente Dominguez grabbed a butter knife. Valdez-Lazo was able
               to get her to drop the knife. The pair eventually stopped
               fighting because they had to go to class. Valdez-Lazo was told
               that he had to go to Vicente Dominguez's class and not his.

               They left the dorm room together, rode the elevator down and
               walked out of the building. They walked together to the Terrell
               Mall area where Valdez-Lazo began to split off and walk towards
               his class. At this point Vicente Dominguez grabbed Valdez-
               Lazo's prescription glasses off of his face. She refused to
               give them back. Valdez-Lazo claims that a group of 5 males
               approached him telling him they were going to beat him up if he
               didn't let go of Vicente Dominguez. The men supposedly were in
               Vicente Dominguez's theater group. Valdez-Lazo let go and the
               pair separated going to their respective classes. Later in the
               day Valdez-Lazo went to WSU Counseling Services for assistance.
               In addition he spoke with a mentor that he has on campus. Both
               entities told him to report the incident to police which he
               eventually did. Valdez-Lazo provided me with a two (2) page
               written statement detailing the domestic dispute. I asked him
               if he is scared or threatened by Vicente Dominguez. He said he
               is scared and threatened by her. He went on to tell me this is
               not the first time they have physically fought each other. This
               has happened many times over the past five (5) years. I asked
               Valdez-Lazo if he wanted Vicente Dominguez charged/prosecuted.
               He said "No". Valdez-Lazo went on to tell me that he just
               wanted to tell his side of the incident because he didn't think
               people would believe him. He was worried that people would only
               believe her and get him in trouble. He also said he wants the
               physical violence to stop. He said "I don't want her to go to
               prison. I want her to get help." I gave Valdez-Lazo my business
               card with the case number, the blue Victim's Rights card, and a
               brochure from ATVP. I spoke with him about the services
               provided by ATVP and encouraged him to call. He did not want to
               call while with me at the police department. I provided him
               education on protection orders, WSU Counseling and Student
               Services. Valdez-Lazo told me he does not want any further
               contact with Vicente Dominguez. I transported Valdez-Lazo to
               Gannon 533. I escorted him up to his room. There was nobody in
               the room. His roommate was gone. Valdez-Lazo invited me into
               the room. I could see the glass jar of fruit on the floor next
               to the door. The lid had come off and fruit was spilled on the
               floor. There was a black straightening iron on the floor near
               the glass jar. Valdez-Lazo showed me the silver wear set on his
               roommates shelf containing the butter knife that Vicente
               Dominguez had grabbed earlier in the day. Valdez-Lazo gathered
               up the remaining clothing and personal items belonging to
               Vicente Dominguez. He gave me a suitcase and a black plastic
               garbage bag with the items to return to Vicente Dominguez. He
               just wants to get his eyeglasses back from her. Sgt. Griffin
               and I told Valdez-Lazo to call the police if his girlfriend
               returns to his dorm room. Sgt. Griffin and I went to Vicente
               Dominguez's residence, Roger 740 at about 1829 hours. We spoke
               to Vicente Dominguez roommate who told us Vicente Dominguez was
               not there. I had tried calling Vicente Dominguez but she would
               not answer the phone. The voicemail box was not set up on her
               phone. I provided the roommate with my contact information and
               asked her to pass it on to Vicente Dominguez. We were unable to
               contact Vicente Dominguez at Rogers and cleared at about 1847
               hours. At about 2040 hours I received a telephone call from

               Valdez-Lazo. He said he has received messages from Vicente
               Dominguez stating that she was going to hurt herself. He also
               said she had been back over to his room pounding on his door
               and using a fork to try to gain entry sometime between 1847
               hours and 2040 hours. He did not call the police as he was
               instructed. I called Vicente Dominguez. She answered the phone.
               She was crying. I asked her if she was all right. She answered
               "no". I asked her if she was or had hurt herself. She replied
               "yes". She told me she was in her dorm room. I told her to not
               do anything to herself and that the police would be right over
               to her room. Sgt. Griffin and I responded to Vicente
               Dominguez's room, Rogers 740. She had cut her left wrist with a
               razor. While waiting for the ambulance I spoke with Vicente
               Dominguez about the earlier dispute today. She gave me an
               account of the incident that was consistent with that of
               Valdez-Lazo. I asked her where were Valdez-Lazo's glasses. She
               went on to tell me the glasses were on a fire alarm type box on
               the top floor of Gannon Hall. I took her into protective
               custody. She was transported by ambulance to Pullman Regional
               Hospital. (See case 14-W5116 for the suicide attempt case). I
               was able to locate Valdez-Lazo's glasses in Gannon Hall and
               successfully returned the item. In addition I gave Vicente
               Dominguez the two bags of belongings to her that came from
               Valdez-Lazo's room. Charges will be forwarded to the Whitman
               County Prosecutors Office. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 5th day of December,
               2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               NARRATIVE: On December 5, 2014 at about 2040 hours I received a
               telephone call from David Valdez-Lazo (07/03/96). He said he
               has received messages from his girlfriend Guadalupe Vicente
               Dominguez (11/11/95) stating that she was going to hurt
               herself. I called Vicente Dominguez as I had been trying to
               contact her regarding an earlier domestic dispute. She answered
               the phone. She was crying. I asked her if she was all right.
               She answered "no". I asked her if she was or had hurt herself.
               She replied "yes". She told me she was in her dorm room. I told
               her to not do anything to herself and that the police would be
               right over to her room. Sgt. Griffin and I responded to Vicente
               Dominguez's room, Rogers 740. She had cut her left wrist with a
               razor. Vicente Dominguez was in the room by herself. She was
               upset about the earlier domestic dispute with Valdez-Lazo.
               While waiting for the ambulance I spoke with Vicente Dominguez
               about the earlier dispute today. She gave me an account of the
               incident that was consistent with that of Valdez-Lazo. I asked
               her where were Valdez-Lazo's glasses. She went on to tell me
               the glasses were on a fire alarm type box on the top floor of
               Gannon Hall. I took Vicente Dominguez into protective custody
               pursuant to RCW 71.05.150 as I had reasonable cause to believe
               Vicente Dominguez is suffering from a mental disorder and
               presents in imminent likelihood of serious harm to herself.
               Vicente Dominguez was transported by ambulance to Pullman
               Regional Hospital. No further investigation. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W5118 SYNOPSIS: Vetter arrested and
               booked into jail for possession of a controlled substance and
               possession of marijuana less than 40 grams. Charges will be
               forwarded to the prosecutor. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE 1. Charles

               Substance Poss. of Controlled Substance Poss. of Marijuana <40
               grams NARRATIVE: On 12/05/14 at approximately 2157 hours I was
               working a DUI emphasis on State Route 195 in a marked patrol
               car. I was heading northbound on SR 195 near mile marker 28
               when I noticed a silver Subaru WRX heading southbound towards
               me. The WRX appeared to be traveling faster than the posted 60
               MPH zone. I activated my in car radar (vehicle 38) and obtained
               a reading of 79 MPH. Once the WRX passed me I turned around to
               catch up to it. It took me 2 miles to catch the WRX because of
               how fast it was driving. I caught up to the WRX at mile marker
               26. I activated my emergency lights and the WRX pulled to the
               shoulder. While walking up to the WRX, I noticed there were
               three occupants. I saw a male in the passenger's side rear seat
               holding an electronic cigarette in his lap. I contacted the
               driver, Matthew Gerhig Green 06/29/96, identified myself,
               informed the driver I was recording, and explained the reason
               for the stop. As I stood at the driver's side window I could
               smell the overpowering odor of marijuana coming from the car as
               if someone had just been smoking marijuana. I asked Green how
               much marijuana was in the car. Green said there was none. I
               asked Green why his car smelled of marijuana then. The rear
               passenger, Charles Oliver H.S. Vetter 11/24/95, stated he is a
               medical marijuana patient. I asked Vetter if he was smoking
               marijuana from his electronic cigarette and Vetter said no,
               that the odor was coming from his pocket. I asked Vetter if he
               had his medical marijuana authorization on him and Vetter said
               his wallet was stolen recently and he only had his ID with him.
               I asked Vetter how much marijuana he had with him and Vetter
               said, "about 3 grams." I asked Vetter how much marijuana he was
               allowed to have on his person. Vetter said, "I believe a pound
               and a half sir." Since I was outnumbered 3 to 1 I asked Vetter
               to speak with me outside of the car where I could separate him
               from the rest of the group. Once outside of the car I asked to
               see Vetter's marijuana and Vetter pulled a sandwich bag of
               marijuana from his right pocket. I asked what kind of marijuana
               it was and Vetter said it was called "charlotte's web." I asked
               if I could see the marijuana and Vetter handed it to me. Based
               on my training and experience I instantly recognized the green

               vegetable material inside the sandwich bag to be marijuana. I
               told Vetter that he was under arrest for possession of
               marijuana and handcuffed (D/L) him. I walked Vetter to my
               patrol car where he was searched incident to arrest. Inside
               Vetter's front pockets I found the following items: -1 BIC
               lighter -1 battery for an electronic cigarette -2 electronic
               vaporizers -1 pill bottle with the label ripped off I opened
               the pill bottle and found several loose pills in the bottle and
               several small ziplock bags. I placed Vetter in the backseat of
               my patrol car and advised him he was being audio and video
               recorded. I read Vetter his Miranda Rights of my department
               issued card and Vetter stated he understood his rights. Vetter
               stated that having his rights in mind he still wished to speak
               with me. I asked Vetter if he had a prescription for the pills
               and he said no. Vetter identified the pills as "Codine" pills.
               I recontacted Green and asked him about smoking marijuana.
               Green did not admit to smoking any marijuana. After evaluating
               Green it was my determination that he was not impaired. I asked
               for Green's consent to search the car and Green stated he would
               not give his consent. For my safety I had Green sit in the
               backseat of my patrol car while I continued my investigation. I
               contacted the remaining passenger, Kurt L Prichard 07/05/96.
               Prichard provided his WADL and stated that he was not involved
               in the marijuana. I asked Prichard if he had any illegal items
               in his property inside the car. Prichard said no. I asked for
               his consent to search his items and he refused. I returned to
               my patrol car and filled out a traffic NOI for speeding and
               issued it to Green. Once the NOI was issued Green and Prichard
               drove off. I told Vetter that he was under arrest for
               possession of marijuana less than 40 grams and possession of a
               controlled substance. I transported Vetter to the Whitman
               County Jail where he was booked in. While Vetter was completing
               his intake process at the Jail I asked him about the plastic
               bags inside the pill bottle. Vetter stated that the bags
               contained "Molly" which is the street name for MDMA. I told
               Vetter that he would be facing charges at minumim of two counts
               of possession of a controlled substance and possession of
               marijuana. I also told Vetter that I would not know the exact
               charges until the drugs were tested. Once Vetter finished his
               intake process I cleared. Once back at the station I found the
               pill bottle to contain the following items: -2 Hydrocodone 5mg
               pills with "Watson 349" imprinted on them -1 Hydrocodone 5mg
               pill with "M365" imprinted on it -2 and 1/2 Codeine 30mg pills
               with "2064 V 3" imprinted on them -6 small ziplock bags
               containing white powder or crystalline substance in them All
               seized items were logged into evidence and pills and powder
               will be sent to the state crime lab for identification
               analysis. Pending the results of the state crime lab, the
               corresponding crimes will be forwarded to the prosecutor. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of

               advised his driving status was DWLS 3rd degree. I had Johnson
               exit the car and he said he thought he knew what this was
               about. I advised him his driver's license was suspended and he
               was under arrest for driving with a suspended license. I placed
               him in handcuffs (double locked) and advised him of his right
               to remain silent and right to an attorney. I issued Johnson
               criminal citation #4Z1026557 for DWLS 3rd degree. I explained

               NARRATIVE: On 12/06/14 at about 0102 hrs I was driving
               northbound on Veterans Way when I noticed two females who were
               walking south on Veterans Way. They caught my attention because
               one of the females, later identified as Madeline L. Ashby
               (011996), appeared to be under the age of 21 and was clearly
               intoxicated. She was stumbling side to side while receiving
               help walking from her friend, later identified as Taylor A.
               Kohrer (072496). As they noticed my patrol car approaching they
               tried to hid behind a support pillar at the entrance to the
               Communication Addition. As I exited my patrol vehicle I asked
               if I could speak with them. The began to walk out on a balcony
               area along the south side of the Communication Addition. I
               advised them that it did not go anywhere and they stopped to
               speak with me. I told them I was concerned with how much Ashby
               had to drink. She admitted having consumed a little bit of
               alcohol. She could not tell me how much she meant when I asked.
               I asked if I could check her eyes to see how much she had to
               drink and she agreed. It took Ashby a second to get and
               maintain her balance with her feet together. Kohrer was
               standing behind and slightly to the side of Ashby. Kohrer
               extended her arm out behind Ashby to make sure Ashby did not
               stumble and fall. I administered a horizontal gaze nystagmus
               test on Ashby. I observed she had bloodshot and watery eyes, a
               lack of smooth pursuit, and a distinct and sustained nystagmus
               at maximum deviation. I could smell the odor of intoxicants on
               Ashby's breath as I administered the test. Ashby did not have
               her ID with her but provided her name and date of birth, which
               I confirmed through Dispatch. The information provided
               confirmed she was under the age of 21. I asked Ashby if she
               would be willing to provide a breath sample so I could see how
               much alcohol was in her system. She agreed and provided a
               sample of .212 on alco-sensor FST #5493. I advised Ashby I
               would be forwarding charges for minor intoxicated in a public
               place to the Whitman County Prosecutor. Kohrer agreed to take
               Ashby home and stay with her through the night to keep an eye
               on her. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 07 day of December,

               from Stephenson South #807 NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR#
               1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 12-06-14 I was dispatched to the odor of
               marijuana coming from Stephenson South #807. I responded to the
               area and contacted the R/P a Britteny Alspach. She stated that
               the R/a's on duty were on their rounds when they smelt the odor
               of marijuana coming from #807. They called the on call Hall
               Director Alspach. She responded to the area and confirmed the
               odor. Upon my arrival I could smell the odor coming from the
               door. I knocked on the door and Jayden Koloski answered the
               door. When he open the door the odor drastically increased. I
               could not see Koloski very well so I turned on my flashlight. I
               could see that his eyes were bloodshot. I asked him if he knew
               why we were there and he said he didn't know. I told him it was
               for the odor of marijuana coming from his room. He denied the
               odor was his. I asked him if he was the only person in the room
               and he said he was. I asked him if he had been smoking in the
               room and he said he hadn't. I asked him if he knew why the odor
               was coming from the room and he said he didn't. I asked him if
               he smoked marijuana and he initially said "No I smoke it
               outside. I asked him how he smokes it and he said "Papers.' I
               asked him when the last time he smoked marijuana and he said "A
               little bit ago." I asked him if he had papers in the room. He
               then he denied smoking at all. I told him I was confused. he
               had just admitted to smoking marijuana and now he was changing
               his story. Koloski was being very evasive with his answered. On
               several occasions he gave me one answer and when I asked the
               question again later he had another answer. I told Koloski that
               I didn't think he was being truthful with me. I told him I
               thought he had been smoking marijuana in his room. He again
               denied the claim. I asked him if his roommate had been smoking
               in his room and he said he didn't know. I asked him if there
               was any marijuana or smoking devices in the room. He looked
               over his shoulder at the room and said "No." I told Koloski I
               was going to be sending him and his roommate, Humberto Zen, to
               student conduct. I explain the process and then cleared.
               Nothing further...................... I certify and declare

               cited, and released for DUI. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Joao G. Moraes/090487 Cited/Released DUI
               4Z1026558 2. NARRATIVE: On 12/06/14 at about 0244 hrs I was
               driving southbound on Stadium Way near Grimes Way. when I
               noticed a vehicle that was driving northbound on Stadium Way.
               The vehicle, WA AQY7531, caught my attention because it
               appeared to be driving faster than the posted 20 MPH speed
               limit. I activated my police traffic radar unit (vh7) which
               emitted a high pitched audio doppler tone that was decreasing
               in pitch. I observed a display on the radar unit of 30 MPH. The
               speed readings were consistent with my visual estimate of the
               vehicle's speed. The suspect vehicle was the only moving
               vehicle in the radar field at the time of the readings. The
               calibration of the radar unit was checked by the use of factory
               certified tuning forks. The radar unit was found to be in
               proper working order. I turned around and initiated a traffic
               stop on the vehicle, turning on my overhead lights. The vehicle
               stopped on Stadium Way near Vogel Hall. I contacted the driver,
               Joao G. Moraes (090487), and told him the reason for the stop
               and the stop was being recorded. As I was speaking to Moraes I
               could smell a strong odor of intoxicants coming from inside the
               vehicle. He had already given me his Driver's license. I asked
               for his registration and insurance. He began looking for it and
               I asked him where he was coming from and he said Rico's. He
               provided me with his insurance I asked how much he had to drink
               and he said a couple beers. I had to ask again for his
               registration. He began looking for it before stopping again and
               asking what I needed. He then said he did not have it in the
               vehicle with him. I asked Moraes to exit the vehicle and he did
               so. Moraes spoke with a slight accent but did not appear to
               have any difficulty understanding or speaking english. I had
               Moraes move to the nearby sidewalk, which was straight and
               level. I asked if he would be willing to perform some voluntary
               field sobriety tests so I could make sure he was not impaired
               and he agreed. I advised Moraes I would be evaluating him based
               on how well he followed my instructions as well as how he
               performed on the test. Moraes was wearing dress type shoes,
               jeans, and a north face jacket. The approximate temperature was
               41 degrees. The first test I administered was the horizontal
               gaze nystagmus test. I told Moraes to stand with his feet
               together and his arms at his sides. I told him to remain in
               this position during the test and he said he understood. I told

               him to follow the tip of my pen with his eyes only and not to
               move his head. Moraes said he understood. I held my pen
               approximately 12-15 inches from his face, slightly above eye
               level. I confirmed his pupils were of equal size and his eyes
               tracked equally. I observed Moraes had bloodshot and watery
               eyes, a lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes, a distinct and
               sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes, and an
               immediate onset of nystagmus in both eyes. I had to remind
               Moraes several times not to move his head during the test. The
               second test I administered was the nine step walk and turn. I
               told Moraes to imagine a straight line on the sidewalk. I told
               him to place his left foot on that line and to place his right
               foot in front of his left, touching heel to toe. I told him to
               keep his arms at his sides and to remain in this position while
               I explained the rest of the test. He said he understood my
               instructions. I told Moraes when instructed to begin to take
               nine steps touching heel to toe down the imaginary straight
               line. I told him to look at his feet the entire time, keep his
               arms at his sides, and count each step out loud. I told him
               once he reached his ninth step to leave his front foot in place
               and to take a small series of steps with his back foot to turn
               around. I told him to take nine more steps back down the same
               imaginary straight line. I told Moraes it was a continuous test
               and once he started not to stop until he was finished with the
               test. I demonstrated the test and he said he understood my
               instructions. As I was explaining the test Moraes stepped out
               of the staring position once. I had to ask him to get back into
               the starting position before beginning the test. During his
               first nine steps Moraes failed to count any of his steps out
               loud. I reminded him on his 4th step to count out loud but he
               continued without counting. Moraes turned improperly, turning
               to his right and pivoting on the balls of both feet. The third
               test I administered was the one leg stand. I told him to stand
               with his feet together and his arms at his sides. I told him to
               remain in this position while I explained the test and not to
               start until instructed to do so. Moraes said he understood. I
               told him when instructed to begin to lift one foot, whichever
               he was most comfortable with, so his toe was approximately six
               inches off the ground. I told him to point his toe so the
               bottom of his foot was parallel with the ground and to keep
               both legs straight. I told him to keep his arms at his sides,
               and to look at his toe. I told him to count out loud by 1000's
               (1001, 1002, 1003, and so on) until instructed to stop. I told
               him if at any point he put his foot down to pick it right back
               up and continue where he left off. I demonstrated the test and
               Moraes said he understood my instructions. Moraes lifted his
               foot off the ground to demonstrate when I asked which foot he
               was going to stand on. He chose to stand on his right foot,
               raising his left. Moraes asked how long to go and I told him it
               was about 30 seconds but to continue until instructed to stop.
               When instructed to begin Moraes lifted his foot, looked at me,
               and asked how long he was supposed to go. I told him again to
               go until instructed to stop. Moraes failed to count at all
               during the test. He put his foot down twice during the test. As
               I was about to tell him to stop he hopped twice and used his

               arms for balance. At this time it was my opinion that Moraes'
               ability to drive a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. I
               asked Moraes if he would be willing to provide a breath sample
               on a PBT and he refused. I advised Moraes he was under arrest
               for DUI and placed him in handcuffs (double locked). I advised
               him of his right to remain silent and his right to an attorney.
               I transported Moraes to the Pullman PD holding facility for the
               breath test. Upon arrival at the PPD holding facility I asked
               Moraes if he wished to speak with an attorney. He said yes so I
               contacted an on call public defender and allowed him to speak
               with Moraes until I noticed Moraes hang up the phone. I checked
               Moraes' mouth at 0317 hrs and found no foreign substances. I
               confirmed with Moraes he understood english and had not
               problems understanding what I was saying. He said that was
               correct. I asked where he was from and he said Brazil. I
               informed him if he would like I could contact his consulate and
               notify them of the arrest. I asked if he wanted me to do that
               and he said no. I read Moraes his Constutional Rights from the
               DUI packet at 0317 hrs and he signed stating so. He also signed
               waiving his rights. I read Moraes his implied consent for
               breath at 0321 hrs and he signed stating it was read to him. I
               asked if he would submit to a breath test and he said yes. I
               checked the yes box on the DUI packet and had him initial next
               to it. I asked if he was confused at all by the implied consent
               warnings and he said no. I checked the no box and had him
               initial next to it. Moraes chose not to answer any questions.
               After waiting for the 15 minute observation period to expire I
               checked the datamaster instrument and found it in proper
               working order with the RFI antenna attached, the breath tube
               warm to the touch, and the temperature display showing 34.00
               degrees. Moraes attempted to provide his first breath sample
               but started and stopped repeatedly, causing the machine to give
               an invalid sample error. I checked Moraes' mouth a second time
               at 0341 hrs and waited for another 15 minute observation period
               to pass. Moraes provided a breath sample of .113 at 0400 hrs
               and a second sample of .102 at 0403 hrs. The breath test was
               administered in accordance to the methods approved by the
               Washington State toxicologist pursuant to the Washington
               Administrative Code. I provided Moraes with a copy of the
               following documents: breath test document, driver's hearing
               request form, notice of hearing/conditions of release, and
               vehicle tow impound form. I explained to Moraes when and where
               he could retrieve his vehicle. I issued Moraes criminal
               citation #4Z1026558 for DUI. I explained the citation to him,
               he received his copy, and was released. Moraes said he did not
               have his key for his apartment or his cell phone because they
               were left in his vehicle. I provided Moraes with a courtesy
               transport to his apartment and contacted the emergency contact
               for his apartment complex, who was able to respond and open his
               apartment for him. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 07 day of
               December, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.
