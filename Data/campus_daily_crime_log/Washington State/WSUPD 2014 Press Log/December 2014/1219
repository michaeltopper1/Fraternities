               DEPARTMENT CASE #:14-W5361 SYNOPSIS:Cougar security units found
               a backpack behind Wegner Hall. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 12-19-14 I was dispatched to a
               found property call behind Wegner Hall. Cougar security units
               had found a backpack in the woods behind Wagner Hall. I
               responded to the area and had them place the pack in the cargo
               area of my patrol vehicle. I returned to the department and got
               the back pack out. It was completely soaked with water. I open
               the bag and it was clear the bag had been in the elements for
               quit some time. There was a cardboard box that contained some
               sort of food and several clothing items. I didn't find anything
               identifying who the pack belong to. I then noticed the
               cardboard box had mold on it. Since there was no identifying
               marks on the pack and there was mold in it I destroyed the pack
               by placing it in the dumpster. Nothing
               further..................... I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 19th day of
               December, 2014, in Pullman, Washington. M. Griffin
