    Narrative: RVWD: 316 / OFC: Edwards/330 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W5049 SYNOPSIS: Unoccupied vehicle rolled
               backwards out of its parking space into another parked,
               unoccupied vehicle. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 12-03-14 at about 0743 hours I was dispatched to
               the report of a non-injury collision in the Alumni Center
               parking lot. The RP was a passerby. I responded to the area and
               saw a silver Subaru Forester, WA/AJV9160, resting against a
               silver Nissan Pathfinder, WA/ANY5562. It looked like the Subaru
               Forester had rolled backwards out of its parking stall into the
               parked Nissan Pathfinder. I took pictures as the vehicles sat,
               both were unoccupied. I also noticed that the Forester is a
               manual transmission and the parking hand brake was not engaged.
               I was able to contact the owners of both vehicles. Tyler H.
               Elliott is the owner of the Forester and Patrick Keopanapay is
               the owner of the Pathfinder. Elliott and Keopanapay responded
               to the scene. Elliott moved his vehicle into a parking stall. I
               facilitated an exchange of information for the owners. The
               pictures were later downloaded to the Spillman Files. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 3rd day of December, 2014, in Pullman,

               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 120314 at approximately 2346
               hours I was dispatched to a possible Malicious Mischief at
               Northside Residence Hall. I responded and spoke with RED Piper.
               She said 3 of her residents had come to her saying they had
               seen 4 males throw eggs at the north side of the hall. She took
               me to speak with Ernest W. Sonido (040296), Nicholas F. Cody
               (011395), and Hudson B. Flynn (031296). They stated they had
               been walking down the Northside access road when they observed
               4 males trying to throw eggs up high onto Northside Residence
               hall. The angle of the throws were such that eggs did not break
               but fell back to the sidewalk and broke there. They stated they
               could not identify anyone but stated one male, possibly
               hispanic, was wearing a Guy Fawkes mask with a Marshawn Lynch
               shirt that was a very bright lime green. They stated this male
               was of average build and approximately 5'10". The group of 4
               then ran along Streit towards the elevator entrance. The
               witnesses did not see which door they had gone in. On the
               exterior of the building I could not see any egg as it was
               lightly raining. There was broken egg on the sidewalk. No
               damage detected. RED Piper told me she had already pulled card
               swipe data from the possible door and would email me with it.
               More to follow I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this ____ day of _____________,

               DEPARTMENT ** COLLISION REPORT ** CASE #: 14-W5073 SYNOPSIS:
               WSUPD vehicle 7 involved in a non-injury collision on Library
               Road. Collision was investigated by Pullman Police Department.
               DRIVER 1: Brett M. Boyd 03/18/85 VEHICLE 1: WA/25517E 2013 Ford
               Taurus Patrol Car INSURANCE: WSU Risk Management DAMAGE: $1200
               passenger's side front quarter panel damage NARRATIVE: On
               12/04/14 at approximately 0314 hours, Ofc. Boyd asked me to
               respond to Library Road where his patrol car was just involved
               in a collision. Upon arrival I contacted Ofc. Boyd who stated
               he was driving northbound on Library Road when he lost traction
               on the hillside and had to come to a stop due to extreme ice on
               the roadway. Ofc. Boyd exited his car and locked the doors so
               he could walk to the station and retrieve tire chains for the
               car. As soon Ofc. Boyd exited and closed the car door, the car
               began to slide on the ice backwards at an angle. The patrol car
               slid for approximately 10 feet before sliding into a traffic
               barrier pole. The patrol car's passenger's side front quarter
               panel struck the pole and the car bounced off by a few inches.
               The car came to a stop at that point. The pole hit just behind
               the wheel well causing a large vertical dent. The damage to the
               patrol car is estimated at $1200. The pole was also slightly
               bent. The damage to the pole is estimated at $500 dollars. Ofc.
               Boyd was outside of the car the whole time and was not injured.
               At the time of the collision all roadways were covered in a
               thick layer of ice from the freezing rain. The temperature was
               approximately 26 degrees F and it was raining at a moderate
               rate. The three hours leading up to the collision was filled
               with several collisions throughout out the city due to the
               freezing rain and icy conditions. I photographed the scene and
               waited with Ofc. Boyd until Ofc. Harris of the Pullman Police
               Department arrived to take over the investigation. Once Ofc.
               Harris completed his investigation, Ofc. Boyd and I were able
               to get the patrol car back to the station without incident.
               Ofc. Boyd filled out a State of Washington vehicle accident
               report form which was added to the files folder. All photos of
               the scene were uploaded to the files folder. END OF REPORT. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 4th day of December, 2014 in Pullman,
