               the complainant/victim, Ariana M. Williams (10/21/94) by
               telephone as requested. Williams wanted to report receiving
               electronic communication regarding a scam. She was solicited
               via email regarding a fictitious job opportunity. All she had
               to do was cash a few checks and then wire the money back to the
               employer. Williams did not cash the checks. She contacted her
               bank who told her this was a scam. Williams then contacted the
               police. She said the emails she received were going into her
               "SPAM" folder. I educated Williams on the check cashing scams.
               Williams did not lose any money in the scam, only her time. The
               suspects are unknown. No further investigation. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               in it laying on the ground in the Green 1 parking lot in front

               (09/08/95) NARRATIVE: On December 18, 2014 at about 1500 hours
               I was dispatched to the report of the odor of marijuana coming
               from Stephenson North 701. I responded to the 7th floor of
               Stephenson North at about 1538 hours. As the elevator doors
               opened I could smell the odor of burnt marijuana. Room 701 is
               nearest the elevator. I knocked on the door several times, but
               there was no answer. I could not see any lights on inside the
               room through the peephole or coming from under the door. I
               heard no noise coming from the room. I spoke with hall staff
               who had seen people come in an out of the room. They thought
               there were people inside who just weren't answering the door. I
               went back again and knocked on the door. Still nobody
               responded. I checked the rooms on either side of 701 and did
               not detect the odor of marijuana. Room 701 was the only room in
               which I could smell burnt marijuana. Hall staff told me the
               occupants are Marc Kuhlmann and Andrew Todd. I was unable to
               contact either occupant. This incident will be referred to WSU
               Student Standards and Accountability. No further investigation.
               I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws
               of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 18th day of December, 2014, in Pullman,
