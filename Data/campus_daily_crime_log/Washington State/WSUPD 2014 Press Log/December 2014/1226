    Narrative: RVWD:MJG/309 / OFC: mjp/327 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W5411 SYNOPSIS: Anhydrous ammonia leak at
               USDA on Pullman-Albion Rd. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR#
               1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 122614 at approximately 1926 hours I was on
               an extra patrol at USDA on Pullman-Albion Rd when I found tanks
               leaking anhydrous ammonia. Two tanks were on a flatbed truck
               (WA/16214E) located to the SW of the maintenance shop. It
               appeared to be coming out as a vapor. Dispatch alerted FD12 who
               responded. One of the volunteer firefighters worked for
               McGregors which was convenient as the tanks were from
               McGregors. He found that the main valve to each tank was frozen
               open. He was able to close the driver's side tank but not the
               passenger side. He also found that a main connection between
               the two tanks was broken and also leaking. This could not be
               fixed. I contacted Jason Sampson of EHS and informed him of the
               situation. FD12 had advised that the situation could wait until
               Monday morning. Sampson said he would contact the responsible
               person for the facility and advise him of the situation. I also
               emailed Patrol to be aware of the situation. I cleared. Nothing
               follows. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 27th day of December, 2014, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer

    Narrative: RVWD:MJG/309 / OFC: dd/329 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W5412 SYNOPSIS: Report of loud noises
               from the furnace coming from the house. Fac Ops responded to
               take care of the issue. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               2. NARRATIVE: On 12-26-14 at approximately 1905 hours, Pullman
               Fire requested we respond to see if we could gain access to the
               house at 975 NE B St. They had been dispatched for a loud noise
               coming from the furnace. I contacted Fac Ops and had them
               respond as well since it was a mechanical issue. Fire cleared
               and I waited for Fac Ops to arrive. We were able to gain access
               to the house and set off the alarm. ADT was able to provide
               enough information for us to find a responsible for the house
               who provided the code for the alarm. Fac Ops had to shut the
               furnace off as they didn't have the parts to fix it at the
               time. They put space heaters in the house to try and prevent
               the pipes from freezing. They stated they would have the
               furnace fixed on Monday. The responsible was advised. Before
               leaving the house, we reset the alarm and secured the
               residence. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 26th day of December, 2014, in Pullman,
