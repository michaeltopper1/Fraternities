               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W5433 SYNOPSIS: John E. Busuego (11-24-
               83) called Whitcom stating he heard an audible alarm on the
               first floor of Avery Hall. I responded and determined the power
               in Avery Hall was not on. Facilities responded, turned the
               power back on, and I was able to get the computer room alarm
               silenced. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 12-30-14, John E. Busuego (11-24-83) called Whitcom stating
               he heard an audible alarm on the first floor of Avery Hall. I
               responded to Avery Hall and determined the noise was the alarm
               for the computer room (rooms 103 & 105). The alarm panel
               displayed "AC Failure". I walked around and determined the
               power was not on in the building. I called WSU Facilities
               Operations and they sent a trouble shooter to turn the power
               back on. Once the power resumed in the building I was able to
               reset the alarm. Corporal Edwards and I entered the computer
               lab to ensure nothing was damaged. Everything appeared to be in
               order so we cleared. Nothing further. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               30th day of December, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               doing his weekly checks of the system. Employee error. I

               31, 2014 at about 0653 hours Cpl. Edwards and I were dispatched
               to the report of a woman and a cat trespassing in the shower
               area of Morrill Hall. We responded to the building where a
               custodian told us she found the woman and cat in the ground
               floor restroom/shower area. Cpl. Edwards and I made contact
               with the woman and cat. I recognized the woman as Allyson A.
               Wolf (06/29/78). The cat was gray in color and had short hair.
               Cpl. Edwards and I had contacted Wolf a week ago in Daggy Hall
               for trespassing. Wolf has no current affiliations with WSU. She
               is flagged as having mental issues in Spillman. Wolf spoke in a
               quiet soft tone with a British accent. She told us that she was
               in the building to meet with someone. Cpl. Edwards told her
               again that the buildings were closed for winter break and she
               could not be in them. Wolf quickly gathered her cat and packed
               up her backpack. We escorted her out of the building. Wolf was
               cooperative and compliant. No further investigation. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.
