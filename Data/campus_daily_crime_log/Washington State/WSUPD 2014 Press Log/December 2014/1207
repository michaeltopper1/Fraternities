               Northside Residence Hall. Upon my arrival I contacted the R/P
               she stated that at around 1200 someone wrote "Kill All the
               Nickles" on the wall of Northside Residence Hall. She didn't
               know what that meant, but she covered it up and waited for the
               police to arrive. I looked at the letters. They appeared to be
               written in a black powder. It could easily be wiped off. I
               photographed the words then we cleaned the wall with a wet rag.
               The message was completely removed. The R/P stated that there
               has been no problems in the hall and didn't know what the
               message was about. I told her if she heard anything to call.
               She said she would and I left the area. I later down loaded the

    Narrative: RVWD: Edwards/330 OFC: Olmstead/339 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY
               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W5154 SYNOPSIS: Cruz Martinez (DOB
               03-03-1993) reported a malicious mischief at Orton Hall.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 12-07-
               2014 at about 1519 hrs I was dispatched to a report of a
               malicious mischief at Orton Hall, located at 1475 SE Olympia
               Avenue. I arrived on scene and contacted Cruz Martinez (DOB 03-
               03-1993). Martinez was working in the Orton Hall lobby at the
               front desk. Martinez told me that on 12-07-2014 at about 1500
               hrs he heard the door open to the guest bedroom. The guest
               bedroom is located down the hallway from the front desk and is
               near the hall director's office. Martinez then saw a male
               walking down the hallway and past the front desk. Martinez did
               not recognize the male and thought he looked somewhat
               disheveled. The male asked Martinez where he was, and Martinez
               told the male that he was in Orton Hall. The male replied and
               said something like, "oh yeah, I passed out". The male then
               stated, "I thought I was in Chinook" and exited the building
               through the doors on the west side of the lobby. Martinez
               thought the male's actions were suspicious, so he walked down
               the hallway and checked the guest bedroom. Martinez found the
               door to the bedroom ajar, and the lock on the door was locked.
               Since the suspicious male obviously did not have a key to the
               guest bedroom, and the fact that the door to the guest bedroom
               is always locked, Martinez realized the male must have came
               from inside the room. Martinez said no one was registered to be
               using the guest bedroom at this time. Martinez looked inside
               the room and saw that one of the exterior windows was broken.
               Martinez estimated that the window was broken sometime between
               1700 hrs on 12-06-2014 and 1500 hrs on 12-07-2014. I checked
               the guest bedroom and saw that one of the exterior windows
               located near the northwest corner of the room was broken. The
               majority of the broken glass had fallen onto the floor inside
               the room. I saw that some of the broken glass panes were still
               affixed to the window frame and had been pushed inward. The
               window was on the ground level, and I found small pieces of
               vegetation and leaves on the floor inside the room. The leaves
               inside the room appeared to match the shrubbery and plants
               located outside the broken window. I noticed that the blankets
               and sheets on the bed were disturbed, as if someone had been
               sleeping in the bed. Martinez stated that the guest bedroom had
               not been used lately, and the custodian always makes the bed.
               It appeared that someone had broken the window from outside the
               building, crawled through the broken window to enter the guest

               bedroom, slept in the bed, and then exited through the doorway
               and into the hallway. I searched the room but did not locate
               anything of evidentiary value. Martinez described the male who
               had exited the guest bedroom as: white male; 20-21 years old;
               6-01; 190 lbs.; brown, curvy hair; black in color, hooded
               pullover that was ripped and faded; blue jeans. Sergeant
               Griffin searched the area for the male, but he was not located.
               The value of the damaged window was estimated to be $500.00.
               WSU Housing Maintenance was notified of the broken window. I
               photographed the scene, and the photographs were downloaded
               into Spillman and attached to this case. Other than the
               suspicious male who left the guest bedroom, no suspects or
               leads were identified. No further action at this time.
