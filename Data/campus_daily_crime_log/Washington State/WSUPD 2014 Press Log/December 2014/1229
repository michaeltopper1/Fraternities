               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W5427 SYNOPSIS: Unlocked the CUB for a
               Panda Express employee. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               2. NARRATIVE: On 12-29-14 at about 1519 hours I was dispatched
               to the report of a lockout. Lilliana A. Rogers, an employee for
               Panda Express, had called earlier asking if I could unlock the
               CUB for her to obtain information from the safe so the code
               could be changed. I told Rogers I could unlock the CUB for her
               but would have to stay with her while she got what she needed
               and then would escort her out. At about 1520 hours I met Rogers
               at the CUB. I verified her WADL and saw her Panda Express
               employee badge around her neck. I unlocked the CUB, went with
               her to Panda Express, then escorted her back outside. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 29th day of December, 2014 Pullman,
               Washington. Corporal Ashley Edwards WSUPD 330
