    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Edwards/330 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W5025 SYNOPSIS: Male subject slipped on
               the ice and possibly dislocated his elbow. Transported to PRH
               via ambulance. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 12-01-14 at about 1425 hours EMS and WSU units
               were dispatched to the report of a fall. Whitcom advised that a
               male subject had slipped on the ice near Todd Hall and possibly
               dislocated his shoulder. I responded and located the male
               sitting on a bench on the west side of Todd Hall. He was
               holding his right arm. The male was identified as Nicholas L.
               Webb. I asked Webb where he slipped and he pointed to an area
               that was not on a cleared path. I could see marks on the snow
               and ice consistent with somebody falling down. I asked Webb if
               he'd like to sit in my patrol car to keep warm while we waited
               for the ambulance. He said he would. I assisted Webb from the
               bench to the passenger seat of the patrol car. I could see that
               Webb was in a lot of pain and he told me that he couldn't feel
               his arm from the elbow down. While waiting for medics I took
               pictures of the area. When Webb fell he was not on one of the
               cleared paths, rather he was attempting to take a shortcut by
               walking between two cleared areas. The pictures were later
               downloaded to the Spillman Files. Once medics arrived they
               placed a splint on Webb's arm and helped him to the ambulance.
               He was later transported to PRH. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

    Narrative: RVWD:MJG/309 / OFC: ENW/328 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W5028 SYNOPSIS: Report of a possible
               telephone harassment and concern over a release of personal
               information. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 120114 around 1729 hrs I was asked to contact
               Whitcom regarding a possible harassment complaint. Upon
               reaching them I was told a female, later identified as Julia K
               Anderson (080979), had called to complain about a phone call
               she had received from an unidentified male posing as a
               fraternity pledge. After speaking with Whitcom I later
               contacted Anderson and was told the following. Anderson
               explained she had been receiving phone calls from a blocked
               phone number at random hours. On one of the occasions she
               answered the phone and the male she was speaking with began to
               ask her a variety of questions. He went on to explain this was
               part of the initiation process to get into a fraternity, which
               he did not identify. The conversation continued with the male
               asking questions and at one point the male asked her if "size
               matters." Anderson told me she found this odd, but answered the
               question. This conversation continued with other questions such
               as does she paint her toe nails. Towards the end of the
               conversation Anderson explained the male asked her on a date.
               Following the conversation Anderson became concerned with how
               this male had obtained her information since she has never
               attended WSU in Pullman. She then contacted the Alumni Center
               as well as the WSU Presidents secretary to complain about this.
               As Anderson and I were speaking I conducted a search of the WSU
               Directory located on it's main web page. I located Anderson's
               information, to include her phone number, and explained this
               was probably how her information had been obtained. We spoke
               about contacting Information Technology to have her information
               removed, at which point I asked her for more specifics
               regarding the caller. She told me the phone number the male had
               called from was blocked and he never identified what school he
               was attending if any. We discussed contacting her local law
               enforcement agency if the calls continued and she told me she
               would. After a few more minutes we concluded our conversation
               and I cleared. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 1st day of
               December, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               05/07/96) answered the door. When the door opened I could smell
               a strong odor of marijuana coming from the room. Jackson was in
               the room as well and I served the trespass paperwork on him.
               Once the paper service was completed I asked Jackson if he had
               a medical marijuana card. He stated he did not. I then asked
               Lewis if he had a medical marijuana card. He stated he did not.
               I asked them both about the odor of marijuana coming from there
               room. They both stated they did not know anything about
               marijuana in their room. I asked them if there were any illegal
               drugs or drug paraphernalia in the room. They both said there
               was not any drug or drug paraphernalia in their room. They did
               state they were at an apartment earlier where someone else was
               smoking marijuana and that may be where the odor was coming
               from. Based on my training and experience the room smelled of
               green marijuana. I gave them two options on how we could handle
               this case. The first option to collect all items in the room
               that were drugs or drug paraphernalia and they would be allowed
               to destroy them and the case would be forwarded to student
               conduct. Or the second option that I would apply for a search
               warrant, at which point if granted, and drugs were found they
               may face criminal charges in addition to the case going to
               student conduct. Jackson and Lewis spoke to each other for a
               moment and decide not to destroy the items they had. They
               continued to argue that there were no drugs or drug
               paraphernalia in the room. Lewis and Jackson both exited the
               room to see if that would eliminate the odor from the room. It
               did not. Officer Stewart seized the room. Officer Westerman
               stayed on scene and I returned to the office to apply for a
               search warrant. I searched the room and found GVM and brown
               waxy material. I found metal knuckles. I called and amended the
               warrant to seize alcohol beverage and legend drugs not
               identified by prescription. I seized one whiskey bottle with

               of drug paraphernalia 2. NARRATIVE: On 120114 around 2311 hrs I
               was dispatched to a report of the odor of marijuana coming from
               room 323 of Stephenson South. Upon my arrival I heard no
               movement from within the room and noticed the odor of burnt
               marijuana coming around the crack of the door. I knocked on the
               door and contacted the resident of the room, later identified
               as Brianna R Fenske (041896), who told me the following. Fenske
               admitted to having smoked marijuana in the room earlier and
               told me there was no remaining marijuana in the room. She went
               on to tell me she smokes marijuana approximately 1-2 times per
               week and is aware of the laws related to possession of
               marijuana. We spoke for some time at which time I asked her if
               she would be willing to allow me to search her room, which she
               could deny, and was told that would be fine. We returned to her
               room and upon a search of her room I noticed trace amounts of
               marijuana, but nothing of note remaining. Fenske showed me her
               pipe, which she admitted to having smoked the marijuana in her
               room with, and agreed to destroy it. We walked to the dumpsters
               outside of the building at which point Fenske destroyed the
               pipe. Upon our return to the building it was explained this
               case would be forwarded to Student Conduct and I asked if she
               had any further questions. She told me she had no further
               questions and was released. Prior to clearing the building I
               spoke with hall staff and told them what I had learned. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 2nd day of December, 2014, in Pullman,
