    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Olmstead/339 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W5237 SYNOPSIS: The University of South
               Carolina Beaufort Police Department requested an agency assist.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 12-12-
               2014 at about 0829 hrs I was dispatched to an agency assist for
               the University of South Carolina Beaufort Police Department
               (USCBPD). I contacted Detective Thomas Aiken from USCBPD on the
               telephone, 518-361-4322. Detective Aiken advised that he was
               working on a telephone harassment case and explained that a
               professor at the University of South Carolina Beaufort had
               received several threatening telephone calls. Detective Aiken
               advised that he had developed a person of interest in the case,
               who was identified as Peter G. Boag (DOB 12-11-1961). Boag is a
               professor in the WSU History Department. Detective Aiken asked
               me to determine if Boag had been in Pullman lately or was out
               of town on assignment. At about 0945 hrs I contacted the WSU
               Department of History Chair, Raymond C. Sun (DOB 09-02-1960),
               on the telephone. Sun advised that Boag has been on
               professional leave for the fall semester and was currently
               residing in Vancouver, Washington. Sun said that it is likely
               Boag has also travelled around for research and/or conferences
               during the past few months. Sun said he had not checked in with
               Boag and does not know what he has been doing. I concluded my
               telephone conversation with Sun. I contacted Detective Aiken on
               the telephone and provided him with Sun's information.
               Detective Aiken forwarded me digital recordings of two of the
               threatening telephone calls. Detective Aiken requested that I
               play the recordings to Sun and determine if he recognized the
               male caller's voice as Boag. At about 1010 hrs I contacted Sun
               in his office at Wilson Hall. Sun listened to the recordings
               and told me that he was absolutely positive the male caller's
               voice was not Boag. I concluded my contact with Sun and left
               his office. I later contacted Detective Aiken and provided him
               with this information. Detective Aiken advised that no further
               assistance was needed. No further action at this time.

               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 12-12-2014 at about
               1215 hrs I was dispatched to a report of a traffic offense that
               had just occurred on Stadium Way near the intersection of
               Grimes Way. Dispatch advised that the complainant, Christopher
               B. Chapman (DOB 03-23-1980), had reported an erratically driven
               vehicle. The vehicle was identified as a blue, 1990 Honda
               Accord (WA Lic. W769WSU). Chapman reported that the vehicle was
               traveling northbound on Stadium Way at a high rate of speed,
               was changing lanes, and almost did not stop for pedestrians in
               the crosswalk. I responded to the area but did not locate the
               vehicle. I determined that the vehicle was registered to
               Guadalupe Angel-Martinez (DOB 10-21-1992), and she resides at
               1650 NE Valley Road #E1 (Kamiak Apartments). At about 1445 hrs
               I arrived at the Kamiak Apartments and located the vehicle in
               the parking lot. I contacted Angel-Martinez and her husband,
               Hilario Rincon-Rosales (DOB 12-12-1998), at apartment #E1. I
               discussed the incident with them and determined that Rincon-
               Rosales had been driving the vehicle on Stadium Way. I
               counseled Rincon-Rosales about his driving and cleared the
               scene. No further action at this time. Olmstead/339 I certify

               male had left the area. Chapman has stated it has been a

               1. Christopher R. Kinzel contacted by PPD 2. NARRATIVE: On 12-
               12-14 at approximately 1650 hours, Pullman PD began receiving
               reports of Christopher Kinzel posting threats on Facebook about
               having a gun. See Case 14-P11263 & 14-P11264. Ofc. Umbright
               contacted me to make us aware of the incidents. The information
               was passed to Sgt. Griffin and Asst. Chief Hansen. Ofc.
               Petlovany and I responded to Clark Hall where Kinzel has an
               office to see if he was there. Kinzel was not in his office and
               we spoke to one of the RP's, Helmut Kirchhoff. Helmut showed us
               one of the postings on Facebook where Kinzel posted, "For the
               record yes I am armed.. I have a glock G42" and then posted a
               photo of Glock from Glock's website and wrote, "Think about
               that again....". Helmut also provided a conversation thread
               between Michael Neff and Kizel, and some emails he had received
               earlier. All have been placed in Files. While we were speaking
               to Helmut, Pullman PD responded to Kinzel's residence and
               contacted him. According to Ofc. Umbright, Kinzel was
               intoxicated and stated the rants he had posted were due to the
               alcohol and he had no real intention of threatening anyone or
               doing any of the things he stated. He also allowed Pullman PD
               to search his residence and no firearms were found. Kinzel
               advised them he had been sober for about 7 months and recently
               slipped as he had become depressed about not being able to be
               with his family for Thanksgiving. Ofc. Umbright stated he had
               contacted all of the RP's involved and that Neff was contacted
               the students involved to let them know what was going on. I
               sent an email to Asst. Chief Hansen, after I attempted to reach
               him by phone, to advise him of the status of the incident. Due
               to a comment in the emails, recommend case be forwarded to
               Title IX Coordinator and Student Conduct. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of

               Beasley Coliseum for graduation. On 12/12/14 at about 2100 hrs
               they received a text from a local person, who was supposed to
               be coordinating the event. She thought this was odd because it
               was supposed to be a business and it seemed very late for them
               to be contacting her. The text instructed them to be at Beasley
               at 0630 hours on 12/13/14 and they would be selling flowers.
               Halvorson was concerned because of the change of item for sale
               and the early hour they were asked to arrive. She was also
               concerned because there had been no discussion of how or when
               they would be paid for working. I told Halvorson that at this
               point it did not seem like there was anything fraudulent going
               on. I told her it was likely they were asked to arrive early
               because people normally arrive quite early for graduation and
               there was probably some instructions and paperwork that needed
               to be done. I told her I would document her concern and to call
               back if she had any further issues. Nothing further. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.

               Assistance was provided but we were unable to locate the
               vehicle. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 12/13/14 at about 0212 hrs Dispatch advised Pullman PD was
               requesting assistance locating a vehicle involved in a hit an
               run at Adams Mall. They believed the suspect, Haregu Amaha,
               lived in Gannon/Goldsworthy. I looked up the vehicle, WA
               ANA1221, and found three subjects associated. Haregu Amaha,
               Segen Haile, and Yonathan Yemane. Amaha did not appear to be a
               current student so it is not likely he is living on campus.
               Haile appears to be one of the registered owners of the vehicle
               with his middle name listed as a first name on the
               registration. Yemane and Haile each had recent parking

               1915 Terre View Dr. I was unable to locate the vehicle in
               either parking lot. I advised Pullman PD I was unable to locate
               the vehicle and told them the parking locations I checked.

               93) reported she was raped. My investigation revealed the rape
               happened in Pullman's jurisdiction. The case was transferred to
               the City of Pullman Police Department for investigation.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 12-13-
               14, Sgt. Griffin advised he had responded to Pullman Regional
               Hospital to investigate a Sexual Assault. He determined the
               Emergency Room staff were still conducting their examination of
               the victim and said they would call when they were complete.
               The PRH Emergency Room staff called stating they were complete
               with their examination and I could now contact the sexual
               assault victim. I responded to PRH and contacted the victim,
               Isabel M. Haynie (09-27-93). Haynie said she had been at
               "Mike's" bar dancing earlier in the evening of 12-12-14. She
               said she was dancing with one male and actually left with a
               different male. She said she felt somewhat intoxicated with she
               went to Mike's, but felt sober when she left. She said she did
               not know the male she left with, but left with him as he
               promised to make her french toast. She said they drove in the
               male's silver sedan, but didn't remember exactly where they
               drove. She said the male drove them to his apartment, which
               Haynie described as being near the WSU Valley/Orchard play
               fields. She said the apartment no one was in the apartment when
               they entered and it was "Pitch black". Haynie asked about the
               french toast and the unidentified black male said something to
               the effect of "Let's come in here first". The male went to his
               bedroom and Haynie followed. She said the bedroom lights were
               off as well. They began kissing on the bed and Haynie said she
               was ok with that. This began getting more "Hot and heavy" so
               Haynie told the male to stop as she was not comfortable with
               what was happening. She said at this point the male pinned her
               arms and legs down with his and began taking her clothes off.
               He them forcibly raped her. Haynie said she squirmed and moved
               throughout the rape. She said the male eventually stopped
               fighting with her and stopped. He then asked her if she would
               stay with him in his apartment and she said she had to get home
               to study for finals. He said he would drive her home and asked
               where she lived. She told the male she live in the Grove
               apartments so he drove her there. One the way to the Grove
               apartments, the male asked if he could stay with her in her
               apartment. she again said no as she had to study for finals.
               The male dropped her off at the Grove apartments and Haynie
               walked up some stairs as if going to her apartment. Once the

               male had driven away, Haynie walked to her house which is
               actually on Myrtle Street. She then went to PRH. Haynie said
               she would like to be driven around the apartments to see if she
               could remember which apartment she had been taken to. After
               driving around she said she recognized the Campus Commons North
               Apartments. The CCN apartments are in the City of Pullman's
               Police Department jurisdiction so I contacted Pullman Police
               Officer Mike Crow (457). I agreed to meet him in the Pullman
               Police Department lobby with Haynie. This case had been
               transferred to the city of Pullman Police Department. The
