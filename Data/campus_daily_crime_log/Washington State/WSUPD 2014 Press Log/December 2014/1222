               1955) NARRATIVE: On 12-22-2014 at about 1045 hrs I was
               dispatched to a report of a non-injury vehicle collision in the
               parking lot located on the west side of Bustad Hall, 1845 NE
               Grimes Way. Dispatch advised that the collision occurred in the
               portion of the parking lot that is located between Bustad Hall
               and McCoy Hall. I arrived on scene and contacted the following
               individuals: Gina M. Gallego Lopez (DOB 03-12-1986), James L.
               Parvin (DOB 04-15-1953), Jarod R. Taylor (DOB 05-19-1984), and
               Janie E. Salvadalena (DOB 09-16-1955). Gallego Lopez was the
               driver of a white, 2000 Chevy Cavalier (WA Lic. AAU9467).
               Parvin was the driver of a white, 2010 International Packer (WA
               Lic. 23767E). Taylor was a passenger is Parvin's vehicle, and
               Salvadalena was a passenger in Gallego Lopez's vehicle. Parvin
               and Taylor are employees of WSU Waste Management and were
               driving a garbage truck. After speaking with all of the
               individuals, I determined the following: Parvin was exiting the
               parking lot near the west side of Bustad Hall, and was
               travelling through the double-laned, curved portion of the
               parking lot. Gallego Lopez was entering the parking lot and
               negotiated the curved portion of the parking lot at the same
               time as Parvin. Gallego Lopez did not turn enough while
               negotiating the curve and crossed into the lane occupied by
               Parvin. The front of Gallego Lopez's vehicle collided with the
               driver side of Parvin's vehicle. Gallego Lopez's vehicle struck
               the tire on Parvin's vehicle, and Parvin's vehicle was not
               damaged. None of the individuals complained of any injuries.
               The damage to the vehicles was consistent with the information
               provided by the drivers and passengers. The vehicles had been
               moved prior to my arrival. I photographed the scene, and the
               photographs were downloaded into Spillman and attached to this
               case. I gave Gallego Lopez a verbal warning for failing to
