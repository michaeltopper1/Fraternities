               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W5367 SYNOPSIS: Arrested driver of
               vehicle for driving under 21 after consuming marijuana. Found
               controlled substance in purse. Booked driver in to Whitman
               County Jail for Poss of Controlled substance. Charges pending

               Fields-Brown, Caden S./080195 Arrested/Booked VUSCA/DUI 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 12/20/14 at about 1934 hours I was contacted by
               Officer Petlovany, who had made a traffic stop on a vehicle for
               defective brake lights. I arrived at the traffic stop location
               on Ferdinand Ln at the Biotech Life Science Bldg. I talked to
               Officer Petlovany and he said he had stopped the vehicle and
               the driver Caden S. Fields-Brown (DOB 080195) was under twenty
               one years of age and had admitted to smoking marijuana. I asked
               Fields-Brown if she would take some voluntary field sobriety
               tests. Fields-Brown asked if she had to do them. I again
               explained that they were voluntary and that she did not have to
               do them. She thought a moment and then said she would do them.
               I asked if she wanted to go into the lobby of the Biotech Life
               Science Building to do the field sobriety tests to get out of
               the rain. She agreed to go inside the lobby to do the tests. I
               could smell the odor of marijuana coming from her person. I
               began the standardized field sobriety tests by asking her to
               stand with her feet together, hands at her side, and to stay in
               that position during the first test. The first test is the
               Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. I explained to Fields-Brown
               that it was an eye test. She was not wearing glasses and I
               asked if she was wearing contacted. She said she was. I
               explained that during the test she needed to follow the tip of
               my pen with her eyes only, and not to move her head. Fields-
               Brown said she understood. I observed both of Fields-Brown's
               eyes were equal size and there was no resting nystagmus. Her
               eyes tracked equally. I did not observe lack of smooth pursuit,
               nystagmus at maximum deviation, or onset of nystagmus prior to
               45 degrees. While I was conducting the HGN I could see tremors
               in Fields-Brown's legs and torso. I also observed during the
               test that she was swaying from side to side about 3 to 4
               inches. The next test I explained to Fields-Brown was the walk
               and turn. I explained to Fields-Brown to imagine a line
               straight out in front of her and to place her left foot on that
               line an then place he right foot in front of her left with her
               heel and toe touching. I also told her to keep her hands at her
               sides and to maintain that position while I explained the test
               and not to begin the test until I told her to. I explained to

               Fields-Brown that she was to take nine heel to toe steps along
               the imaginary line. Then when she reached her ninth step to
               keep that foot on the line and make a series of small steps to
               turn around and take nine to heel to steps back along the same
               line. I demonstrated three steps and I also demonstrated the
               turn and then three return steps, explaining that she need to
               take the full nine steps down and back. I told her that during
               the test she needed to keep her hands at her side, look at her
               feet while she was walking and count her steps out loud. I also
               told her that once she began the test she needed to continue
               until the test was complete. I asked Fields-Brown if she
               understood, she said she did. I told her to begin the test.
               After explaining the start potion to Fields-Brown she put her
               right foot on the line with her left foot heel to toe in front
               of her right, opposite foot position of the instructions I gave
               her. Once she began the test she was using her arms to balance,
               holding them away from her body 6 to 8 inches. Her fourth step
               was offline by 1 inch. When she reached her ninth step she
               stopped and asked me how to do the turn again. I explained that
               she needed to do the turn how I instructed her to. Fields-Brown
               put her feet side by side and took two half steps and then a
               series of small steps without either foot planted and turned
               around. Between steps 4 and 5 on the return steps she did not
               touch heel to toe, there was about a 1 inch gap. The next test
               I explained was the one leg stand. I instructed Fields-Brown to
               stand with her feet together, hands at her side, and to
               maintain that position while I explained the instructions. I
               also told her not to begin the test until I told her to. I
               asked if she understood she said she did. I explained that
               during this test she was to lift the leg of her choice so that
               her foot was six inches off the ground and parallel to the
               ground, with her leg straight. Then she was to count out loud
               by one thousands, and I demonstrated the stance and the
               counting "one thousand one, one thousand two, one thousand
               three". I explained that during the test she needed to keep her
               hands at her side, she needed to look at her foot and to count
               out loud as demonstrated. I asked if she understood, she said
               she did. Fields-Brown raised her right foot and counted by one
               thousands. She counted to 23 by one thousands in 30 seconds.
               She was swaying about 4 to 6 inches while she performing the
               test. She also used her arms for balance raising them six to
               eight inches from her sides. When she was at twenty she began
               to lean to the left and had to use her arms in order to keep
               from hoping or putting her foot down. The next test I explained
               was the modified Romberg test. I explained that she needed to
               stand with her feet together and her hands at her side and to
               maintain that position while I explained the test. I asked if
               she understood and she said she did. I explained that during
               this test she was to tilt her head back, close her eyes and
               estimate the passage of thirty seconds. Once she believed
               thirty seconds had past to put her head down. I asked if she
               understood she said that she did. I told her that she could
               begin. During this test I observed eye lid tremors in her eyes
               as she had her head tilted back. I also saw tremors in her
               legs. This is an indicator of marijuana use. Fields-Brown put

               her head down after 42 seconds. I asked her how she determined
               the passage of thirty seconds. She stated that she used to be a
               drum major and tried to think of a rhythm, but thought she sped
               up at the end. The next sobriety test I conducted was lack of
               convergence. I told Fields-Brown to stand with her feet
               together and hands at her side while I conducted the test. I
               explained it was another eye test. I told her to keep her head
               still and follow the top of my pen with her eyes only. I told
               her that I would bring the top of my pen close to her nose but
               not touch her. I asked if she understood and she said she did.
               I observed a lack of convergence in her left eye when I
               conducted the test. Her left pupil would track to the bridge of
               her nose and then would bounce outwards away from her nose.
               This is an indicator of marijuana use. I asked Fields-Brown to
               provide a voluntary breath sample for the PBT. She provided the
               sample to my ALCO Sensor FST (SN#102461) and it recorded a
               reading of .000. I performed the PBT in accordance with state
               toxicologist recommendations and I have been trained in using
               the ALCO Sensor FST PBT. I asked Fields-Brown if she had smoked
               marijuana and she said that she did smoke marijuana a few hours
               ago at a friend's house in Moscow, ID before she drove to
               Pullman to show her friend the Washington State University
               campus. Officer Petlovany asked the passenger, Zachary R.
               Whitfield (DOB 071591), when they smoked the marijuana. He said
               they smoked marijuana in the vehicle at about 6:45pm. That
               would mean Fields-Brown smoked marijuana approximately 45
               minutes before the traffic stop. As I was doing the PBT Officer
               Petlovany gave Officer Stewart a small purse that Whitfield had
               given him from the car. Whitfield said it was Fields-Brown's
               purse. Fields-Brown identified as her purse when Officer
               Stewart showed it to her. Fields-Brown said that there was
               marijuana in the purse. Officer Stewart asked if she wanted us
               to take the marijuana out of the purse so that she could keep
               the purse with her other property. Fields-Brown said that
               Officer Stewart could take the marijuana out of the bag. I told
               Fields-Brown that she was under arrest for driving under 21
               after consuming marijuana. I placed her in handcuffs (DL), told
               her that she was being visual and audio recorded, and as I read
               her Miranda warnings from my department issued Miranda card,
               Officer Stewart pulled a baggy out of the purse containing a
               green vegetable material, and a rolled up piece of gold foil
               paper. In the foil paper was a small plastic baggy containing a
               whitish brown crystalline rock. Officer Stewart asked Fields-
               Brown what it was. Fields-Brown said that she did not want to
               answer any questions. I searched Fields-Brown incident to
               arrest and placed her in the back of my patrol vehicle. I asked
               Fields-Brown if I could have consent to search the vehicle. She
               said that it was not her vehicle. I talked to Whitfield and
               asked if the property in the vehicle was his. He stated that
               the property was Fields-Brown's because he was helping her move
               to Moscow, ID. Whitfield said he was the owner of the vehicle.
               I asked Whitfield if I could have his consent to search the
               vehicle. He said that he did not want me to search the vehicle.
               Officer Petlovany asked Whitfield to step out of the vehicle
               and I told Whitfield that I was seizing the vehicle and I was

               going to apply for a search warrant. I transported Fields-Brown
               to Pullman Police Department for a DRE examination. At Pullman
               Police Department I talked with Officer Lambley, of the Pullman
               Police Department, who is a DRE Officer. I explained what I
               observed during Fields-Brown field sobriety tests. Officer
               Lambley said she would give Fields-Brown her Miranda warnings
               again, and explain that she is a DRE, to see if she would do
               more sobriety tests. I cleared Pullman Police Department and
               went to Washington State University Police department to apply
               for search warrants for a blood draw and a search of the
               vehicle. At the Washington State University Police Department I
               examine the small whitish brown crystalline rock and compared
               them to Google images of methamphetamine and MDMA. It was
               similar in consistency to methamphetamine, or a rock of MDMA. I
               used field test kits and they showed a presumptive positive
               result for 2 C which is a Schedule I Controlled Substance.
               Officer Lambley contacted Officer Stewart later and said that
               Fields-Brown spoke to attorney on the phone and refused any
               further test. On 12/21/14 at about 0045 I called Judge David
               Frazier to apply for the two search warrants. Judge Frazier
               asked me to e-mail him the signed affidavits for the search
               warrants and the search warrants. I e-mailed the documents to
               Judge Frazier. At 0127 I received an e-mail from Judge Frazier,
               the warrants were granted and signed copies were attached to
               the e-mail. I returned to Pullman Police Dept. and asked
               dispatch to call out Pullman Fire Dept. for a blood draw. At
               about 0145 I read the search warrant for blood to Fields-Brown
               and Pullman Firefighter/Paramedic B. Wakeman. After reading the
               warrant I realized that I had not activated my VieVu body
               camera, I turned on at that point. I provided Wakeman with two
               gray topped blood vials. The blood draw was completed at 0200
               hours. I had Fields-Brown and Wakeman sign the receipt of
               property taken, and the return of search warrant. I cleared
               Pullman Police Dept. and returned to Washington State
               University Police Dept. to complete the PC booking form and fax
               it to the Whitman County Jail. At WSU Police Dept I secured the
               blood evidence in the evidence room for future processing. I
               then completed and fax the PC booking sheet to the Whitman
               County Jail. Officer Boyd responded to Pullman PD and
               transported Fields-Brown to Whitman County Jail to be booked on
               Possession of a Controlled Substance. On 12/21/14 at 0255 I
               read search warrant #122114B for the search of the vehicle,
               CA/6YVC147 a silver 2002 Toyota Rava 4 VIN/JTEGH20VX20060963,
               located on Ferdinand Ln. Officer Stewart and I conducted the
               search of the vehicle. In the front passenger area in a garbage
               bag that was hanging from the gear shift Officer Stewart found
               a plastic baggy containing white powder residue. During the
               search a framed wall mirror that was located in the back of the
               vehicle was broken. We completed the search without further
               incident. I left a copy of the search warrant, a copy of the
               inventory of items seized in the vehicle in front of the
               instrument panel. I also left my business card with information
               about how to receive reimbursement for the mirror that was
               damaged. I attempted to call Whitfield on his cell phone, and
               at Nendels where he was staying, and he did not answer. Officer

               Stewart called for the next rotational tow. I completed the DUI
               impound form and Auto Body Supercenter arrived and towed the
               vehicle. I gave the tow truck driver a copy of the impound form
               and I left a copy of the impound form in the vehicle. I cleared
               the scene and returned to the WSU Police Dept. I secured the
               plastic baggy with white residue in the evidence room for
               future processing. On 12/21/14 I photographed and processed the
