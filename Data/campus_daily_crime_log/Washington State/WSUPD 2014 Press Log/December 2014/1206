    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Whitman / 323 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W5136 SYNOPSIS: RED contacted dispatch
               and advised she could smell marijuana coming from room 423
               Stephenson North. I responded to that room and could smell a
               faint odor of marijuana. Subject was contacted earlier in the
               day by the RED and destroyed the marijuana he had in the room.
               No further action taken. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR#
               1. Joshua J. Mason (DOB 102695) Warned Possession of Marijuana
               2. NARRATIVE: On 12/06/14 at about 2206 dispatch advised that
               an RED from Stephenson North was calling to report the odor of
               marijuana coming from room 423 Stephenson North, Pullman, WA. I
               radioed dispatch and asked if there had been any previous
               similar history at that room. Dispatch advised they had
               received a call on 12/06/14 at about 0313 reporting an odor of
               marijuana coming from the room. Sgt. Griffin said they received
               that call but were unable to respond because all units were
               busy with other calls, and RED staff handled the call. I
               responded to room 423 Stephenson North. I could smell a very
               faint smell of marijuana coming from the room. I knocked on the
               door and Joshua J. Mason (DOB 102695) answered the door. I
               asked him if this was his room and he said it was. There was
               also a female in the room, Tenaya L. Sigler (DOB 080496).
               Officer Stewart ask her to step out as well. I asked Mason if
               he knew why we were there. Mason asked if it was about what
               happened last night. I asked him what happened last night, and
               he said he was contacted by the RED about the odor of
               marijuana. He said he admitted to possessing marijuana in the
               room and the RED had him destroy it. Mason also said there was
               no more marijuana in the room. Officer Stewart asked if we
               could search the room he said that we could. I began to read
               him Ferrier warnings and he decided he did not want us to
               search his room. He stated that he had just got back to his
               dorm taken a shower and Sigler came over. He stated he did not
               smoke any marijuana or have any left in his room. Officer
               Stewart asked if his roommate may have some marijuana in the
               room. Mason said he did not think so. Due to the faint odor and
               the incident from earlier in the day I believed Mason was
               telling the truth. I warned him and I cleared. Nothing

               his ipad was stolen. I contacted the complainant, Dino Dodig
               (032593), who told me his WSU issued 64gb Ipad air was stolen
               from the WSU track locker room in Bohler Gym sometime between
               2000 hrs and 2100 hrs. He left the ipad in his locker, which
               does not lock, and when he returned it was gone. The value of
               the ipad is approximately $600. Dodig was able to send me
               photographs of the box, which show the serial number of the
               ipad as DMPN8137FK12. I am still waiting for him to send me his
               WSU network ID and when he last used the ipad on the network so
               it can be flagged in case someone tries to use it on the

               was driving southbound on B St when I notice a large group
               standing behind the Cougar Cottage. As I passed the group I
               noticed a male laying on his back not moving. I turned around

               questions correctly. I asked Pettit for his ID but he refused
               to provide it. I waited with Pettit until medics arrived. Once

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W5140 SYNOPSIS: Report of an intoxicated
               female in Perham Hall. Pullman Ambulance evaluated the subject
               and it was determined she did not need to go to the hospital.
               Subject reported she thought she may have been slipped molly at
               a party. At this time there is no evidence to confirm that.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               12/06/14 at about 2333 hrs Dispatch advised of an intoxicated
               female in Perham Hall room 116 who thought she may have been
               slipped molly at a party. Officer Whitman and I responded. We
               located the female, later identified as Alesha K. Barrera
               (050395). Barrera was hightly intoxicated but able to answer
               some questions. Her friends advised Barrera had been drinking
               Everclear and thought she had quite a bit of it to drink.
               Barrera said this was the first time she had ever drank
               heavily. She thought she might have been given molly because
               someone at the party gave her a drink and then said there was
               molly in the drink after she drank it. The male who gave it to
               her was named Jose and is in the Beta Theta Pi fraternity. They
               were drinking at the Beta Theta Pi live out, but they could not
               tell me where that was located. Pullman ambulance personnel
               arrived and evaluated Barrera. Her blood pressure was slightly
               elevated, which Barrera said was normal for her. All of her
               other vital signs were within the normal range. Based on my
               training and experience I do not believe Barrera was under the
               influence of molly. She admitted to being inexperienced with
               alcohol and drinking a large amount of a very strong liquor.
               The feelings she was describing and my observations of her
               physical condition all indicated a high level of alcohol
               intoxication. If she was given molly it was not enough to show
               any physical effects. Barrera was left with her sober friend,
               Kailee M. Hyett (070695). I went to the Beta Theta Pi
               fraternity and contacted one of the members, who was not
               identified. I asked him if they had any members named Jose in
               the house. He said they had two members by that name. He
               checked the house but neither Jose was there. I provided him
               with my business card and requested he have the two members
               contact me. I will be contacting Pullman PD Officer Emerson to
               discuss any further investigation. More to follow. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.

               will be forwarded to the Prosecutor on Weir. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Brady M.T. Weir 11/11/95 Charges
               Forwarded MIP Exhibiting 2. NARRATIVE: On 12/07/14 at
               approximately 0118 hours I was standing next to the Smith Gym
               parking lot, backing up Ofc. Whitman who was contacting a male.
               While standing with Ofc. Whitman I noticed a male and female
               walking eastbound on Cougar Way towards me. The male, later
               identified as Brady Martin Thomas Weir 11/11/95, grabbed my
               attention specifically. Weir had his right arm over the
               shoulder of a female he was walking with. Weir was having
               difficulty walking straight even though he was being supported
               by the female. Weir was having so much difficulty walking that
               he was pushing the female from one edge of the side walk to the
               other as he stumbled along. It was clear that Weir was heavily
               intoxicated. As Weir and the female approached me I noticed
               that Weir appeared to be under the age of 21. When Weir reached
               my location I asked if he had a second to talk. Weir and the
               female stopped. I told Weir what I had observed and asked if he
               had his ID with him. Weir reached into his pocked at pulled out
               a wad of cash. Weir dropped a $10 dollar bill and I pointed it
               out to him. The female picked the $10 dollar bill up and handed
               it back to Weir. Weir placed the bill back with the rest and
               out stretched his arm towards me. It appeared as if Weir was
               trying to give the money to me. I asked Weir if he was trying
               to give me the money and Weir said "yep." I asked Weir why he
               was trying to pay me since I was a Police Officer. Weir said
               something not intelligible. I asked Weir his name and date of
               birth. Weir provided it verbally. I asked Weir how much he had
               to drink tonight and Weir said, "11." I asked Weir what kind of
               drinks he had and Weir said wine. I asked Weir if I could look
               at his eyes and he said I could. I told Weir to follow the tip
               of my pen with his eyes only and not to move his head. As soon
               as I moved my pen Weir moved his head to follow the pen. I had
               to tell Weir several times to keep his head still but he never
               did. During the test I observed equal tracking, lack of smooth
               pursuit, and distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum
               deviation. During the test Weir was swaying backwards and
               forwards. As Weir stood before me I could clearly smell the
               odor of intoxicants coming from his breath. I asked Weir if he
               was willing to provide a PBT sample and Weir said he would. I
               found my PBT (Alco-Sensor FST #16805) in working condition. I
               attempted three different times to have Weir provide a proper

               sample. Each time Weir would either not blow through the straw
               or he would suck inwards. It was clear that Weir was
               purposefully trying not to provide a PBT sample. I told Weir
               that he was under arrest for MIP and handcuffed him. I advised
               Weir that he was being audio and video recorded. I walked Weir
               to my patrol car where he was searched incident to arrest.
               Nothing of evidentiary value was found. I had Weir sit in the
               back seat of my patrol car as I researched his name. I found
               that Weir had not been contacted by Law Enforcement in Whitman
               County before. I explained to Weir that I was forwarding
               charges of MIP Exhibiting to the Prosecutor as well as
               referring my case to Student Conduct. Weir stated he
               understood. Weir was released from custody and walked with his
               female friend the rest of the way home to Coman Hall. END OF

               about 0122 hours I observed a male and female walking on the
               sidewalk on Cougar Way near Smith Gym. The male, later
               identified as Shaunveer S. Sandhu (DOB 121394), was staggering
               from side to side and appeared intoxicated. I stopped and
               contacted Sandhu. I was beside Sandhu and tried to get his
               attention several times and he continued to walk. He finally
               stopped and turned around to talk to me. His eyes were watery
               and I could smell a strong odor of intoxicants coming from him.
               I asked him how much he had to drink. He said he had a fair
               amount. I asked him what he was drinking and he said he was
               drinking hard alcohol. I asked where he was going he said he

               from him I placed him under arrest for negligent driving 1st

               R./073194 Charges Forwarded Neg Driving 1st/ VUCSA 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 12/07/14 at about 0157 hours Officer Westerman
               made a traffic stop on a vehicle that was driving 50 mph on
               Cougar Way, near Northside Dormitory, Pullman, WA., which is 20
               mph zone. Officer Westerman stopped the vehicle at the
               Presbyterian church on Stadium Way. I responded to the traffic
               stop location. Officer Westerman said he had made initial
               contact with the driver and he could smell alcohol coming from
               the vehicle and the driver's eyes were bloodshot and watery. I
               contacted the driver, Triton R. Cole-Vogler (DOB 073194) and I
               could smell alcohol coming from the vehicle and I could see
               that Cole-Vogler's eyes were watery. I asked Cole-Vogler if he
               mind stepping out of the vehicle and performing some voluntary
               field sobriety test. He said he would. The first test I
               administered was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN) test. I
               explained the first test was an eye test that he needed stand
               with hands at his sides and follow the tip of my pen with just
               eyes, keeping his head still. I did not observe any of the
               standardized clues for this test. I did have to remind Cole-
               Vogler to follow the tip of my pen. Twice he looked away from
               the pen and looked at me. The next test was the walk and turn.
               I told Cole-Vogler to imagine a line straight out in front of
               him, place his left foot on the line with his right foot in
               front of his left foot touching heal to toe, and to keep his
               hands at his sides. I told him to maintain that position while
               I explained the instructions. I asked him if he understood and
               he said he did. Cole-Vogler could not maintain the position
               while I explained the instruction. He stepped out of the
               position twice and stood with his feet side by side for several
               seconds before beginning the test. On the ninth step during the
               walking phase of the test Cole-Vogler turned by pivoting both
               of his feet simultaneously. I explained and demonstrated during
               the instruction phase the turn should be done by making a
               serious of small steps. The next test was the one leg stand. I
               explained the instructions and demonstrated the test. I

               instructed and demonstrated how to count by one thousands
               during the test. During the test Cole-Vogler counted by
               Mississippis. I then asked Cole-Vogler if he would provide a
               breath sample for the PBT. He stated he would not. I placed
               Cole-Vogler under arrest for Negligent Driving first degree. I
               placed him in handcuffs(DL). I began searching Cole-Vogler
               incident to the arrest. In his right front pants pocket I felt
               a cell phone and hard cylindrical object. I asked him what it
               was and he stated it was his cell phone and a lighter. I pulled
               the cell phone out of his pocket and the other object was a
               glass container containing a white powder. I said "what was
               that? It's not your lighter.". I stopped my search, Officer
               Stewart advised Cole-Vogler that we were recording, and I read
               him his Miranda warnings from my department issued Miranda
               warings card. Cole-Vogler said he understood his rights and did
               not want to talk to me at this time. I transported Cole-Vogler
               to Pullman Police Department holding facility. I waited with
               him in an interview room while Deputy DeRosier was processing a
               juvenile on the BAC machine. I then placed Cole-Vogler in a
               cell. I conducted a field test of the white powder found in
               Cole-Vogler's pants pocket. On 12/08/14 at I certify and

               report there was an intoxicated male who fell out of bed and
               was injured, with a laceration on his arm. He was then trying
               to start fights with people at room 279. I responded and upon
               my arrival I could hear, from down the hallway, a male subject
               yelling. When I reached room 279 I saw one male, later
               identified as Joseph S. Smith (082195), who was not wearing a
               shirt and had a large amount of blood on his upper body and
               face. I could see he had a swollen right eye, and it looked as
               if he had been punched in the face. There was a male on the
               floor in the room, he was later identified as Hunter S. Jacobs
               (090595). Jacobs had a swollen right eye and a large laceration
               to his left arm, which had pressure applied to it by another
               male who was not identified. There was blood sprayed all over
               the room and it was clear there had been a fight in the room.
               It was clear Jacobs was quite intoxicated. He was still yelling
               at Smith, who was in the hallway and completely calm. Jacobs
               had a very strong odor of alcohol on his breath. Jacobs told me
               he was visiting Smith, who was a long time friend. Jacobs was
               sleeping in room 279, which was Smith's room. Smith returned
               home with a female and he and Jacobs began arguing about
               something. They would not elaborate on what the argument was
               about and would only say it was "stupid". During the argument
               Jacobs pushed Smith, who pushed him back. They both threw
               punches at each other before the fight was broken up. After
               looking around the room we discovered that somewhere during the
               altercation a coffee pot which was on a nearby table was broken
               inadvertently, likely by Jacobs' arm and causing the
               laceration. Officer Stewart told me he spoke to Smith, who
               confirmed the story I received from Jacobs. Neither party
               wished to press charges against the other and it appeared to be
               a mutual combat situation. Throughout my conversation with
               Jacobs it was clear he was the instigating party in the
               argument/fight. He was continually trying to yell at Smith,
               calling him names and swearing at him. Smith remained calm
               throughout the time I was there and did not appear to be

               POLICE DEPARTMENT ** COLLISION REPORT ** CASE #: 14-W5148
               SYNOPSIS: One car rollover collision on SR 27 near Zakarison
               Road. Only one occupant in the carand they were transported to
               PRH. Washington State Patrol later took over the investigation.
               DRIVER 1: Steve Dale Tronsen 09/28/90 VEHICLE 1: WA/AGU1876
               1999 Saturn SC2 WITNESS(ES): Kenneth Duane Owens 02/20/69
               NARRATIVE: On 12/07/14 at approximately 0515 hours I heard
               Whitman County Sheriff's Office being dispatched to a one car
               roll over on SR 27 at mile marker 7. Since there were no
               Deputies on duty I radioed dispatch that I could head that way
               until someone was able to respond. Dispatch stated that they
               were unable to contact a deputy or State Patrol and would
               appreciate my response. Dispatch gave me the details of a one
               car rollover collision and the driver was pinned inside his
               over turned vehicle. While en route dispatch updated me stating
               that the driver was now outside of the vehicle with a head
               injury. My response to the crash scene was slowed due to the
               very slick highway. The road surface was covered in a thick
               layer of frost. Upon arrival I found the crash scene to be on
               SR 27 approximately 300 feet from Zakarison Road. District 12
               Fire crew was already on scene. As I exited my car I noticed a
               tan colored Saturn passenger car upside down in a field
               approximately 200 feet east of the highway. The car was heavily
               damaged. I walked up to a car that had pulled over to the side
               of the road and in the backseat of the car I found the driver
               of the Saturn. The driver was later identified as Steven Dale
               Tronsen 09/28/90. Tronsen had blood covering a large section of
               the left side of his face. Tronsen was looking straight ahead
               and appeared to be dazed. I asked a female standing next to
               Trosen what happened and the female (not identified) stated she
               pulled up to the scene after the collision and had Tronsen sit
               in the back of her car until help arrived. I asked Tronsen what
               happened and Tronsen said he did not know. I asked Tronsen if
               there was anybody else in the car and Tronsen said he did not
               know. I asked Tronsen where he lived and again Tronsen said he
               did not know. It was clear that due to the violent crash he had
               just been in Tronsen was confused. I walked down to the car and
               searched it for other occupants. I found no signs of any other
               individuals inside the car at the time of the crash. About this
               time Pullman Ambulance arrived on scene and transported Tronsen
               to Pullman Regional Hospital for treatment. I returned to the
               roadway to inspect the skid marks. The skid marks began a few
               feet south of Zakarison Road. It appears as if Tronsen drifted

               to the western shoulder. Both of his passenger side tires went
               into the soft gravel shoulder for a few feet before the skid
               marks turned back towards his lane. Once all four tires were
               back on pavement the passenger's side rear end came around
               causing the car to slide across the southbound and northbound
               lanes. It appeared that the car was at an approximate 45 degree
               angle in relation to the road when it went off the roadway. The
               car went down an approximate 8 foot embankment and struck the
               field just prior to a barbwire fence. The car then rolled over
               the fence and most likely flipped end over end before coming to
               a rest on the roof of the car. I photographed the skid marks
               starting from Zakarison Road. I was able to photograph up till
               the car left the roadway before the batteries in my camera
               died. I found several McDonalds clothing items in the wreckage
               of the car. I had dispatch contact both Pullman McDonalds to
               see if Tronsen had been on his way to work at McDonalds.
               Dispatch stated Tronsen did work at McDonalds and his parents
               had already called to notify his boss he would not be in due to
               the crash. I contacted dispatch and asked if they had found out
               if someone was responding to the scene. Dispatch stated a WSP
               Trooper was en route from Clarkston. I remained on scene until
               the Trooper arrived. Once the Trooper arrived I turned over my
               information and he stated I could clear. END OF REPORT I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 7th day of December, 2014 in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer
