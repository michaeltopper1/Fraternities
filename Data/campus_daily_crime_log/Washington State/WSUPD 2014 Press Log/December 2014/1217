               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W5313 12/17/14 SYNOPSIS: Verbal dispute
               between a faculty member and a student regarding a note card
               used during a final exam. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR#
               1. AUGER, Andrew A. Refer to Student Conduct 07/03/91 2.
               NARRATIVE: On December 17, 2014 at about 0810 hours I was
               dispatched to a person refusing to leave a room but eventually
               left. The complainant was not specific with Whitcom about where
               the event was happening. Todd Hall 430 and the 8th floor of
               Johnson Tower were both referenced by the caller. I attempted
               telephone contact with the complainant. Unfortunately the only
               phone number came back to the classroom Todd 430. Nobody
               answered the telephone. Whitcom provided me with another
               telephone number but it did not belong to my complainant. I
               went to Todd 430 where I made contact with the complainant,
               Nathaniel C. Nicol (04/02/69). He is a faculty member in the
               School of Politics, Philosophy, and Public Affairs at WSU. The
               classroom was full of students taking a final exam. Nicol
               stepped out of the room and spoke with me in the hallway. He
               told me the students are allowed to put their own notes on one
               (1) 3" x 5" note card. The student can use this note card
               during the final exam. Nicol went on to tell me this is
               specifically documented in his class syllabus. Nicol caught a
               student, Andrew A. Auger (07/03/91) using a card larger than
               3x5. Nicol had a blank 3x5 card in his hand as an example.
               Nicol and Auger got into an argument about the card. Nicol took
               Auger's card and cut it down to 3x5 and handed it back to
               Auger. He showed me the remnant piece. It looked to be about
               1x5. The two men continued to argue. Nicol eventually asked
               Auger to leave the room as he was being disruptive to the other
               students taking their final exam. Auger wanted to have another
               opportunity to finish taking his exam. Nicol told him no. Nicol
               called 911 to have Auger removed from the room. While he was on
               the telephone with Whitcom Auger left the room. Auger wanted to
               know who Nicol's superior was. Nicol told him to go to Johnson
               Tower 8th floor to the Philosophy Department. Auger then left
               the room. Nicol and Auger only exchanged words, no threats were
               made. I went to Johnson Tower 801 where I contacted Auger in
               the Philosophy Office. He was writing his statement and working
               with office personnel to schedule a meeting later this
               afternoon with Philosophy officials. I spoke with Auger. He
               told me he was taking his exam when the professor took his card
               out of his hand. The professor left the room and came back a
               few minutes later with scissors and his cut note card. Auger

               admits to arguing with Nicol and telling him to call security.
               Auger said this is "ridiculous". He said he was asked to leave
               and didn't at first. He then left the room when he found out
               where Nicol's supervisor was. Auger said there was no threats
               or physical contact made between him and Nicol. Auger
               apologized for wasting my time. No further investigation at
               this time. The matter will be handled by the School of
               Politics, Philosophy, and Public Affairs. WSU Student Standards
               and Accountability will be notified. I certify and declare
