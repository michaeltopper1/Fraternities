               that it was an eye test. She was not wearing glasses and I
               asked if she was wearing contacted. She said she was not. I
               explained that during the test she needed to follow the tip of
               my pen with her eyes only, and not to move her head. Bull said
               she understood. I observed both of Bull's eyes were equal size
               and there was no resting nystagmus. Her eyes tracked equally. I
               did not observe lack of smooth pursuit, nystagmus at maximum
               deviation, or onset of nystagmus prior to 45 degrees. I did
               have to tell Bull several times to keep her head still and only
               follow my pen with her eyes, because she would move her head to
               the left as she followed my pen. I also observed during the

               test that she was swaying from side to side about 3 to 4
               inches. The next test I explained to Bull was the walk and
               turn. I explained to Bull to imagine a line straight out in
               front of her and to place her left foot on that line an then
               place he right foot in front of her left with her heel and toe
               touching. I also told her to keep her hands at her sides and to
               maintain that position while I explained the test and not to
               begin the test until I told her to. I explained to Bull that
               she was to take nine heel to toe steps along the imaginary
               line. Then when she reached her ninth step to keep that foot on
               the line and make a series of small steps to turn around and
               take nine to heel to steps back along the same line. I
               demonstrated three steps and I also demonstrated the turn and
               then three return steps, explaining that she need to take the
               full nine steps down and back. I told her that during the test
               she needed to keep her hands at her side, look at her feet
               while she was walking and count her steps out loud. I also told
               her that once she began the test she needed to continue until
               the test was complete. I asked Bull if she understood, she said
               she did. I told her to begin the test. On her first step from
               the starting position she stepped on her toe and lost her
               balance slightly. She continued with the test. On several of
               her steps she was placing her foot down and then drawing her
               foot back to touch heel to toe. On her first nine steps I
               observed Bull veer off line gradually going left. When Bull
               reached her ninth step she pivoted on both feet to turn around
               without taking a series of small steps as instructed. She
               returned nine steps, not on the same line that she walked the
               first nine steps on. The next test I explained was the one leg
               stand. I instructed Bull to stand with her feet together, hands
               at her side, and to maintain that position while I explained
               the instructions. I also told her not to begin the test until I
               told her to. I asked if she understood she said she did. I
               explained that during this test she was to lift the leg of her
               choice so that her foot was six inches off the ground and
               parallel to the ground, with her leg straight. Then she was to
               count out loud by one thousands, and I demonstrated the stance
               and the counting "one thousand one, one thousand two, one
               thousand three". I explained that during the test she needed to
               keep her hands at her side, she needed to look at her foot and
               to count out loud as demonstrated. I asked if she understood,
               she said she did. I asked her which foot she was going to
               raise, she said she was going to raise her right foot. Bull
               raised her right foot and counted by one thousands. She counted
               to 27 by one thousands in 30 seconds. She maintained her
               balance during the test. The next test I explained was the
               modified Romberg test. I explained that she needed to stand
               with her feet together and her hands at her side and to
               maintain that position while I explained the test. I asked if
               she understood and she said she did. I explained that during
               this test she was to tilt her head back, close her eyes and
               estimate the passage of thirty seconds. Once she believed
               thirty seconds had past to put her head down and let me know. I
               asked if she understood she said that she did. I told her that
               she could begin. During this test I observed eye lid tremors in

               her eyes as she had her head tilted back. This is an indicator
               of marijuana use. I also observed that she could not maintain
               the positioning of her head during the test. Bull's head would
               drop and her body would begin to lean forward during the test.
               Bull put her head down at thirty seconds. I asked her how she
               determined the passage of thirty seconds. She stated that she
               counted by thinking about how long a second was. I asked Bull
               if she had smoked marijuana and she said that she did smoke
               marijuana about an hour ago, just before she went to pick up
               her friends. Bull's statement of when she smoked marijuana was
               consistent with the drugs called we responded to earlier. I
               told Bull that she was under arrest for driving under 21 after
               consuming marijuana. I placed her in handcuffs (DL), told her
               that she was being visual and audio recorded, and I read her
               Miranda warnings from my department issued Miranda card. I
               searched Bull incident to arrest and transported her to Pullman
               Police Dept. At Pullman PD I asked Bull to provide a voluntary
               breath sample for the PBT. She provided the sample to my ALCO
               Sensor FST (SN#102461) and it recorded a reading of .000. I
               performed the PBT in accordance with state toxicologist
               recommendations and I have been trained in using the ALCO
               Sensor FST PBT. I returned to the WSU Police department and
               wrote an affidavit for a search warrant and a search warrant. I
               called Judge Douglas B Robinson. I was sworn in and I read him
               the affidavit and the search warrant. Judge Robinson granted
               the warrant at 0251 hours on 12/14/14 warrant #SW121414A. I
               went to Pullman Police Dept. and asked dispatch to have Pullman
               Fire Department respond to Pullman PD for a blood draw. I read
               the warrant to Bull and Pullman Firefighter Pat Fitzgerald.
               Fitzgerald collected two vials of blood from Bull. I placed the
               vials in a box and sealed it with evidence tape in preparation
               to be sent to the Washington State Toxicology Lab. I gave Bull
               the notice of hearing page of the DUI packet. I forgot to have
               Bull sign the Notice of Right to Hearing portion on the DUI
               packet. I photographed and fingerprinted Bull. I released Bull
               and gave her a courtesy transport to Coman Hall. I went back
               WSU Police department and secured the blood vials in a locker
               in the evidence room for future processing. On 12/14/14 at
               about 2059 I processed the blood vials into evidence and
               submitted the paperwork for the state lab. I placed the vials
               in locker 25 in the WSU Police department evidence room. While
               preparing the return of search warrant to send to the court I
               realized that I forgot to have Fitzgerald and Bull sign the
               form. I contacted Bull and asked if I could meet with her to
               have her sign it. She said she would meet me in the lobby of
               Coman Hall. As I pulled up to Coman Hall Bull was outside I
               asked if she would sign the return of search warrant. She asked
               what it was I told her it was the return of the search warrant
               letting the court know what was seized. She asked what would
               happen if she refused to sign it. I told her that I would just
               mark refused in the signature box. She said she did not want to
               sign it. I wrote refused in the signature box and wrote the
               date and time on the form. I went to Pullman Fire department
               and Firefighter Fitzgerald sign and dated the return of search
               warrant. I video and audio recorded this incident with my VieVu

               NARRATIVE: On 12/13/14 at 2323 hrs I was driving southbound on
               B St. approaching Campus St. when I noticed a female, later
               identified as Linsey R. Sturgill (121795), who was walking
               southbound along B St approaching Campus St. She caught my
               attention because she appeared to be under the age of 21 and
               was having extreme difficulty walking, stumbling side to side
               even with the help of two friends. I contacted Sturgill as she
               and the female friend who was with her, who was not identified,
               crossed Campus St. toward Honors Hall. The male who had been
               with them turned around and went the other way when I
               approached. I asked Sturgill how much she had to drink and she
               told me "a lot". I asked how old she was and she said "19
               bitches". I told Sturgill she needed to sit down so I could
               speak with her and took her by the right arm. I could smell an
               overwhelming odor of intoxicants on her breath as she spoke to
               me. I did not ask Sturgill to perform a horizontal gaze
               nystagmus test because it was clear she was unable to maintain
               her balance on her own and I was concerned about her falling
               and injuring herself. I asked if she would be willing to
               provide a breath sample and she agreed. She provided a sample
               of .230 on alco sensor FST #5493. I told Sturgill she was under
               arrest for MIP and placed her in handcuffs (double locked). I
               put her in the back of my patrol car while I completed a
               citation. I issued her criminal citation #2Z1026561 for MIP
               Exhibiting. I explained the citation to her, she received her
               copy, and was released. Her friend agreed to take care of her.
               As they were walking to Honors, where the friend lived,
               Sturgill almost fell down. Both female's ended up laying on the
               ground and Sturgill began vomiting and was not responsive. I
               requested Dispatch send an ambulance to our location. As soon
               as Sturgill heard there was an ambulance coming she became much
               more alert. She was still very heavily intoxicated but was able
               to speak with us and answer questions. Her friend contacted two
               other people who were in Honors to come help her get Sturgill
               inside. Pullman ambulance personnel arrived and determined
               Sturgill could be released to her friends. Nothing further. I

               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and

               Officer Petlovany and I responded. Upon our arrival we went to
               room 509, where the subject was reported to be. We contacted
               the subjects roommate, Don H. Hume, who told us his roommate,

               staff. Crawford was asleep in his bed as we spoke with Hume.
               The complainant, Quinnlin R. Whitman (031495), and the other

               uncooperative, standing in the doorway to his room not allowing
               them to look inside. He had not been physically aggressive or
               threatening at all toward them. After they left they said they
