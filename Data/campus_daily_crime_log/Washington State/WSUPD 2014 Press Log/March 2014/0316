               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W1049 03/16/14 SYNOPSIS: Provided
               Pullman Police assistance in dealing with an elderly male with
               mental issues and three dogs. NAME/DOB: None CITE/SECTOR#: None

               ____OEO Sent? _____OFC/ ____CNSL SRV Sent?_____OFC/ WSU
               STUDENT: ____YES ____NO OTHER UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On March
               16, 2014 at about 1000 hours I backed up Pullman Police Officer
               Crow on Stadium Way at Monroe Street. He was out with an
               elderly male from Shelton, WA who came to Pullman with his
               three (3) large black labs. The male was seeking assistance
               from WSU in dealing with the radio frequency, probes, and alien
               ships following him around. The male voluntarily went to
               Pullman Regional Hospital. I later learned he left without the
               clearance of mental health professionals. Pullman Police
               requested assistance in locating the male and vehicle at about
               1306 hours. I located the vehicle traveling west on SR 270 near
               Terre View Drive. Officer Crow and I stopped the vehicle on
               Davis Way near the bus stop at State Street. It was the same
               male who was contacted earlier in the morning. Officer Crow
               explained to him that he had to go back to the hospital. Before
               taking him to the hospital we gave his dogs water and let them
               out of the truck to relieve themselves. They were put back in
               the truck with the windows rolled down. The temperature was
               about 56 degrees Fahrenheit. The male owner assisted with the
               caring of the dogs. The vehicle was locked with the dogs
               inside. The male was cooperative and went with Officer Crow to
               the hospital without incident. He thanked me for my help. Vievu
               video was taken. Assistance provided, no further investigation.
               I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws
               of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 16th day of March, 2014, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer
