               DEPARTMENT ** COLLISION REPORT ** CASE #: 14-W0986 SYNOPSIS:
               Report of a hit and run collision which occurred sometime
               between 1500 hrs on 100213 and 0800 hrs on 100313. The
               reporting party was requesting a case number for insurance
               purposes. DRIVER 1: VEHICLE 1: INSURANCE: DAMAGE: DRIVER 2:
               Parked Vehicle VEHICLE 2: AOC0222 INSURANCE: State Farm POLICY
               #: 209-9800-A14-47N EXP: 071414 DAMAGE: $600.00 WITNESS(ES):
               None NARRATIVE: On 031114 around 1638 hrs I was dispatched to a
               report of a cold non injury collision near the Columbia
               Apartments. I attempted to contact the reporting party, later
               identified as Rosyln M Swanson (102993), and left a message for
               her to call me. Around 2200 hrs I spoke with Swanson and was
               told the following. Swanson explained that on 100213 around
               1500 hrs she had parked her vehicle in the Columbia Village
               Apartments parking lot in the top tier. She went on to tell me
               she usually parked in that area and when she came back to her
               vehicle around 0800 hrs on 100313 she noticed the passenger
               side rear quarter panel had been damaged. She had no suspects
               and believed the damage had occurred when someone had been
               backing out of the parking space next to her. I asked her to
               describe the damage to me and she told me the quarter panel had
               been dented and was approximately 1 foot in length and
               scratched. At this point I asked her why she had waited until
               now to report the incident. She told me she had contacted her
               mother after noticing the damage and she was told they would
               take care of it in the spring. When they had contacted her
               insurance company they were told they needed a police case
               number in order to process the claim. I made arrangements to
               see the vehicle and photograph the damage and a short time
               later I contacted her at her residence. I photographed the
               damage to the vehicle, which I noticed had extended from the
               rear quarter panel near the bumper forward to the gas tank
               door, and estimated the damage to be around $600.00. After
               obtaining her drivers license, registration, and proof of
               insurance we spoke about what to do in the event of a collision
               or where her vehicle is involved in a hit and run in the
               future. Prior to clearing I gave Swanson my business card along
               with the case number for insurance purposes and told her if she
               had any questions to give me a call. Upon my return to the WSU
               Police Department I downloaded the photos to this case and
               cleared the call. No suspects and no leads. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               NARRATIVE: On 03/11/14 at approximately 2221 hours I was
               monitoring traffic on North Fairway near the SRC when I noticed
               a Toyota Rav4 heading northbound on North Fairway. The Rav4
               appeared to be traveling faster than the posted 20 MPH zone and
               I activated my handheld radar (Decatur Scout 2013). I obtained
               a reading of 32 MPH. The Rav 4 slowed and turned left into the
               SRC parking lot. I pulled behind the vehicle and initiated a
               traffic stop. I contacted the driver, Nicholas Robert Mishko
               04/05/94, identified myself, informed the driver I was
               recording, and explained the reason for the stop. I asked for
               Mishko's driver's license and he reached into the backseat to
               grab his wallet. While Mishko was grabbing his wallet I noticed
               a 40 oz bottle of malt liquor beer on the driver's side rear
               floor board. The bottle was tucked up under the driver seat.
               The bottle appeared to be about half full. Mishko handed me his
               WADL that showed him to be under the age of 21. I asked the
               passenger, Flash William Leland Hodges 10/21/92, how old he
               was. Hodges said he was 21. I asked Mishko who's car it was and
               he said it was his. I asked Mishko if he could hand me the beer
               that was behind his seat. Mishko grabbed the beer and handed it
               to me. I returned to my patrol car and ran Mishko through
               dispatch. Mishko's driver's license was clear. I also had
               dispatch run Mishko's criminal history. Dispatch stated Mishko
               had did not have any arrests on his record. I returned to
               Mishko and asked him to speak with me outside the car. Once
               outside the car I told Mishko that I would be forwarding
               charges of MIP Possession off to the prosecutor. Mishko said he
               understood. I issued Mishko a Sector NOI for his speed and no
               proof of insurance. Once issued I had Mishko pour out the beer
               in the grass. I told Mishko that he was free to go and I
               cleared. During my contact, I did not smell the odor of
               intoxicants coming from the car or Mishko. I have no reason to
               believe that Mishko was drinking prior to driving. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 12th day of March, 2014, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer
