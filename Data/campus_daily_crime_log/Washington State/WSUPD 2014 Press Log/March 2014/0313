               03/13/14 at approximately 0753 hours WSUPD was dispatched to
               the Outdoor Rec for a burglary alarm. The alarm showed "front
               door". Upon arrival Sgt. Macy and I checked the building and
               found everything secure and no one inside. I spoke with an ORC
               employee and Fac Ops employee (who arrived on scene). I
               suggested that they move the front door motion detector. The
               detector was faced so that it would activate any time someone
               went to the front door during non business hours. I certify and

               approximately 1145 hours WSUPD was dispatched to an unknown
               injury collision on SE Stadium Way at Stephenson Complex. Asst.
               Chief Hansen and I responded. Upon arrival I found a White 2005
               Dodge Minivan (WA AJL2650) facing northeast resting with its
               driver's side back bumper against a light pole. I spoke with
               the driver (identified by WADL as Jingwei Ma) and passenger
               (identified by WADL as Iftikhar Zeb) and asked if they were
               injured and they said no. I asked what happened. Ma said he was
               stopped at a red light at the intersection of SE Stadium Way
               and SE Nevada St. Ma said he was in the lane closest to the
               curb. Ma said his vehicle died and started to roll backwards.
               Ma said he applied the brakes, but nothing happened. Ma said
               his vehicle continued to roll backwards and went onto the
               sidewalk and struck a light pole. I provided Ma with my
               business card and case number. I noticed damage to the back
               driver's side of the vehicle. The light on the vehicle was
               broke and dangling. I also noticed a dent in the same area. I
               saw paint transfer and scratches to the light pole, but I did
               not notice any structural damage to the pole. I took photos of
               the damage and saved it to the case. Ma said he had already
               contacted a AAA tow. I told Ma I would provide the university
               with his information for any reimbursement purposes. Since the
               vehicle was safely off the roadway and remaining on scene
               appeared to cause more traffic congestion I chose to leave. I
               set cones out on the sidewalk so no one would walk into the
               vehicle. I later returned to the scene and retrieved the cones
               and confirmed the only damage to the pole was scratches. I sent
               Greg Streva (with FacOps) an email with the case number and the
               driver's information. I completed a SECTOR PTCR and saved it to
               the case. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 13th day of March,

               STUDENT: ____YES ____NO OTHER UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 031314
               at about 1200hrs, I received a phone call from Zami Wilson, WSU
               HRS, who wanted an officer to contact Barbara Monroe outside of
               her English class in CUE 412. Monroe had some concerns
               regarding an irritated colleague, Jamesbucky Carter, who had
               been excluded recently from an interview with a search
               committee in which she is the chair. I told her to call 911 if
               she felt that her life was threatened in any way. I also told
               her that if she sensed any indicators that were a concern for
               her safety to call the police department and we would intervene
               or assist WSU HRS with a game-plan for her safety. Currently
               when Carter found out that he had been excluded from the
               interview he got angry and posted a few sentences about not
               particpating in any more meetings or not wanting to communicate
               with colleagues. He also posted a note on his office door
               saying, "Students welcome, but no one else." Carter has also
               received a few complaints from students last semester about him
               being somewhat "volatile" in class which made them feel a
               little uncomfortable. I am trying to contact Barbara Monroe
               again to see exactly what that means (whether he was yelling or
               something more than that). Carter has not done anything at this
               point that would be considered threatening toward any colleages
               other that than being angry. The English Department Chair, Todd
               Butler, is aware of the situation as well. Monroe and Carter's
               offices are in Avery Hall. There is nothing further at this
               time. MFL/313 I certify and declare under penalty of perjury

               03/13/14 at approximately 1330 hours I was dispatched to a
               suspicious call at Terrace Apts. The reporting party (Housing
               maintenance) said a male subject was looking into vehicle
               windows near the "D" building. The reporting party described
               the subject as a white male wearing black pants and a brown
               hoodie. The reporting party saw the subject walking north on
               Merman towards Terreview. I located a subject matching the
               description on the side of Cougar Corner Mart. As I pulled into
               the parking lot he saw me and walked towards the back of the
               building. I activated my VieVu camera and walked around the
               opposite side of the building. I located the subject walking
               northwest on Terreview near CCN. I contacted the subject and
               asked what he was doing. The subject, verbally identified as
               Chance L. Rogers, said he was out looking for cigarettes. I
               told Rogers the report I received and asked if he was looking
               in vehicles and he said he was not. Rogers allowed me to frisk
               him and I felt nothing on his person. Rogers told me he
               recently moved in with his friend "Nick" near the playfields. I
               did not have a crime to further detain Rogers so I allowed him
               to leave. I returned to Terrace Apts. and spoke with the
               reporting party. The reporting party told me he only saw Rogers
               looking into their maintenance van and that he did not enter
               the vehicle. I did not identify the reporting party as he was
               cleaning carpets. I returned to WSUPD and downloaded the video
               to the computer. I sent an email to officers advising them of
               the suspicious circumstances. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 13th day of

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 03-13-14 I was contacted by Officer
               Boyd via the radio. He stated off duty Assistance Chief Hansen
               had seen a motorcycle riding in the field near the intersection
               of Forest Way and SR 270. When the motorcycle exited the field
               he followed it. When they got to the lower tier of Lot #1 he
               got the motorcycle to stop. He told the driver who he was and
               that he had called an officer to respond. Upon my arrival I saw
               Hansen speaking to the driver of the motorcycle a Ian
               Hammerstrom and the passenger a Amanda Burkley. Both were
               wearing helmet at that time. I asked Hansen what was going on
               and he said he was coming home when he saw the motorcycle in
               the field riding up the hill. He stopped his vehicle and could
               hear the motorcycle's engine running. The motorcycle rode up
               the hill and exited onto Forest Way. He said he got the
               motorcycle to stop on the lower tier of Lot #1. I contacted the
               driver and passenger. I explain to the two why they were being
               contacted. Hammerstrom stated that he hadn't seen the no
               trespassing sign until he was leaving the area. he also said
               that he had only been down there once before. I told the two
               that they could be arrested for criminal trespassing and
               driving with their wheels off roadway. Hammerstrom apologized
               and said he would never do it again. I told the two I was going
               to refer them to student conduct for the trespassing, but no
               infraction would be written. I told the two to tell their
               friends that the area was closed to motor vehicles. They said
               they would spread the work to keep out. The two were ran
