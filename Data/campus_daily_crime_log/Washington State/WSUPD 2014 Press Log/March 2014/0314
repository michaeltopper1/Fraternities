               03/14/14 at approximately 1035 hours I was dispatched to the
               report of a non-injury collision in the entrance to Orton Hall
               that involved a parked vehicle. I arrived on scene and spoke
               with the driver, Douglas Wickham. Wickham said he was traveling
               west on Olympia Ave and turned south into the entrance of Orton
               Hall. Wickham said his passenger side front bumper collided
               with the back driver's side bumper of a parked vehicle (WA
               AFK4700). Wickham pointed out a few scratches on the parked
               vehicle. I photographed the damage. I noticed towards the
               middle and passenger's side of the bumper there was already
               damage. Wickham showed me the paint that transferred to the
               front of his dump truck's bumper. There was no damage to the
               dump truck. I provided Wickham with my business card and case
               number. I told him I would forward the information to Risk
               Management. I went to Orton Hall and contacted the registered
               owner of the vehicle, Hengwei Zhang. I provided Zhang with my
               business card and case number and told him to get in touch with
               Risk Management, which I provided him the phone number for. I
               showed Zhang the damage that was caused. I saved the photos to
               the case. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 14th day of March, 2014, in Pullman,

               Approximately $3000 WITNESS(ES): None NARRATIVE: On 03/14/14 at
               approximately 1100 hours I was dispatched to a hit and run
               collision that just occurred on SE Spokane St. at SE College
               Ave. The reporting party, Taylor Greenfield, said the suspect
               vehicle drove up SE College Ave. While en route Whitcom advised
               that the suspect vehicle returned and both parties were in the
               Daggy Hall parking garage. Upon arrival I met with the drivers,
               Taylor Greenfield and Lori Bruce. I asked Greenfield what
               happened. Greenfield said she was traveling north on SE Spokane
               St. Greenfield said she stopped at the intersection of SE
               College Ave (south end) for a pedestrian in the crosswalk.
               Greenfield said after the pedestrian crossed she proceeded
               north through the intersection and Bruce collided with the
               driver's side of her vehicle. I asked Greenfield if she was
               injured and she said no. I asked Greenfield if she was wearing
               her seatbelt and she said she was. I asked Bruce to tell me
               what happened. Bruce said she was traveling east on SE College
               and was stopped at the stop sign. Bruce said she noticed
               traffic was stopped for pedestrians crossing Spokane St so she
               decided to go. Bruce said Greenfield then began to drive north
               and she collided with her. I asked Bruce if she was injured and
               she said no. I asked Bruce if she was wearing her seatbelt and
               she said she was. At the intersection where the collision
               occurred Spokane St traffic does not have any traffic control
               devices (stop or yield signs). The crossing College Ave.
               traffic has stop signs. I gathered both driver's information
               and provided them with an exchange of information. I
               photographed the damage to the vehicles and saved the photos to
               the case. I issued Bruce an infraction for Failure to
               stop/yield at intersection. I completed a SECTOR PTCR and
               attached it and the NOI to the case. Nothing further. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.

               after being on scheduled days off I checked my email. I
               received an email from Carol Robinson, Director of
               Administrative Services, WSU Libraries, on March 11, 2014.
               Robinson was concerned about the agitated behavior of Diane
               DecourcyPickford. Holland Libraries have been receiving phone
               calls from DecourcyPickford. Robinson spoke with her on March
               11, 2014 by telephone. I called Robinson on March 14, 2014 at
               about 1120 hours. We spoke about DecourcyPickfords behavior.
               Robinson was told by DecourcyPickford that she was trespassed.
               I checked Spillman and there were no active trespass orders.
               DecourcyPickford is not threatening anyone, but she is being
               disruptive to the staff at Holland Library. She suffers from
               mental illness according to family members. DecourcyPickford
               has only called, not appeared in person. She is not a current
               WSU student or employee. Robinson wanted the police to know
               about DecouryPickford's ongoing behavior. It has been some time
               since she has bothered the Holland employees. I called
               DecourcyPickford and had to leave a message for her. I told her
               that she is being disruptive to the library staff and they
               would appreciate it if she stopped calling them. The email is
               attached to the case. No further investigation. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               _X___NO OTHER UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 03/14/14 at
               approximately 1645 hours I was dispatched to the parking lot of
               VTH for the report of a subject drinking a Rainier beer in his
               car. I responded and located the subject, identified by Idaho
               license as Thomas West. I told West the reason I was there and
               asked if he was drinking beer. West said he indeed was and was
               waiting for his wife to get off work. I asked West if she would
               be driving home and he said she would. Since West only had his
               auxiliary power turned on to listen to his radio I did not
               pursue the issue further. Although West had a bad taste in
               beer, his music selection was good. I cleared. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               14th day of March, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               NARRATIVE: On 03/15/14 at about 0142 hrs Dispatch advised of
               hall staff in Stephenson South reporting the odor of marijuana
               coming from room 211. Corporal Daniels and I responded. As I
               appraoched the door I could smell a strong odor of marijuana. I
               knocked on the door and two males, Daniel C. Marqueen and
               Alexander J. Schumacker, answered the door. I asked who lived
               in the room and Schumacker said he did. I asked both of them to
               step into the hall so I could speak with them and they did. I
               asked if either of them had medical marijuana cards and they
               both said they did not. I told them I was there because the
               room smelled very strongly of marijuana. I asked for their
               ID's. Schumacker provided his student ID and date of birth.
               Marqueen provided his WA driver's license. I told Schumacker I
               was going to give him the chance to choose to go retrieve the
               marijuana from the room and whatever they used to smoke the
               marijuana. I told him I would have him walk downstairs with me
               and destroy the items and it would be sent to student conduct
               only. Schumacker agreed. Marqueen said he had not been smoking
               marijuana at all. He said he is in ROTC and gets monthy drug
               tests to make sure he does not use drugs. I told him I would
               include the information in the report but his name would still
               be in the report as being contacted. I walked outside with
               Schumacker where I observed him destroy a small corn cob pipe
               and a plastic bag containing what I recognized to be marijuana.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 15 day of March, 2014, in
               Pullman, Washington. _______________________________________
