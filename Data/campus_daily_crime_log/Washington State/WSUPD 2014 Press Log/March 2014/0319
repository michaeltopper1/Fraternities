               NARRATIVE: On 03/19/14 at approximately 0745 hours I was
               dispatched to the report of a theft at the Streit-Perham
               Center. The report was of missing letters from the Blade Sign
               along the roadway on Stadium Way. I responded and noticed a
               total of 26 letters missing from the north and south side of
               the sign. I photographed both sides of the sign and saved the
               photos to the case. I called Jodeen Magers with Fac Ops and
               asked her what the replacement cost was for the letters. Magers
               said it cost $1300 the last time 4 letters were taken. Magers
               said they are replacing all of the lettering and have a budget
               of $1000 per sign. I will list the value at $1000 for the
               complete replacement. Since being on dayshift (after 02/14) I
               remembered seeing letters missing from the sign. No suspects or
               leads. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the
               laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this ____ day of _____________, 2014, in
               Pullman, Washington. _______________________________________
