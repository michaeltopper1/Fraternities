               texting a 14 year old girl. I interviewed two possible
               witnesses. Both said all they knew was that the subject bragged
               about the skyping and texting, but did not go into detail. I
               have no actual witnesses. I spoke with the subject, Joshua
               Estvold, on 03/01/14. Estvold admitted to skyping and texting,
               but said there was nothing sexual in nature. Estvold told me
               the girl's name is Brooke and lives in Kentucky. Estvold said
               he has even skyped with her mom. Through my interview with
               Estvold he was showing no signs of deception and I tended to
               believe him, although the situation is odd. More to follow, but

               NARRATIVE: On 02/24/14 I was informed via email of a report of
               possible child abuse that happened in California over 8 years
               ago. I spoke with the victim, Eric Oregon Izazaga, and learned
               that his mom would hit him with an open hand, a slipper, a
               shoe, and a cord (similar to a phone charger). I asked if he
               ever bled and he said the cord would leave a welt, but would go
               away. Eric said all of this stopped when he was 10 years old
               because his mom started going to church. Eric said his mom has
               been apologetic since and always cries and apologizes to him
               now about how she treated him. I asked Eric if he would
               consider what his mom did "child abuse". Eric said at the time
               he did, but looking back he would consider it discipline. More
               to follow. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 03/01/14 at approximately 1733 hours,
               I was dispatched to a cold hit and run case at the Blue 1
               overflow lot. I called the reporting party, Fangzhou Yang
               01/02/95 and asked him to meet me at his car. Upon arrival I
               found Yang's car parked in the second tier down from the top.
               Yang stated he last drove his car about two weeks ago and has
               not checked on it until today. Yang said he found a large dent
               on the passenger's side rear quarter panel. Yang believed that
               the large dent was caused by someone punching his car. The dent
               was about three and a half feet off the ground and not
               consistent with a car hitting Yang's car. Also the passenger's
               side of the car was next to a sidewalk where another car could
               not hit him. I looked at the dent and was unable to see any new
               disturbances in the dust on the car. The damage appeared not to
               be very recent. I was unable to see any marks that would
               identify what struck the car. The dent was about 6 inches in
               diameter and the estimated value of damage is $300 dollars. I
               took photographs of the damage and provided Yang with his case
               number and my business card. Yang had no idea why someone would
               target his car. At this time there are no leads or suspects.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 2nd day of March, 2014, in

               SRC patrons are allowed to rent the room, however they are not
               allowed to use the sound system unless they are a fitness
               instructor. There was a miscommunication between SRC personnel
               and Donnan was allowed to use the sound system. When SRC
               personnel realized their mistake they went to the room to
               secure the sound system. They also asked Donnan to leave the
               room. Donnan became upset and began yelling at the staff. He
               cursed and kicked exercise balls across the room. Paulson and
               Selstead asked him several times to leave and told him they
               would call the police if he refused. Donnan eventually made his
               way towards the main entry and continued to yell and be
               disruptive. Selstead also explained that the room can be
               reserved for one hour. Someone with the SRC booked Donnan for
               1.5 hours, beginning at 1700 and ending at 1830. I asked
               Selstead if she wanted Donnan trespassed from the facility. She
               said "yes". Selstead said he can come back tomorrow. Officer
               Westerman and I explained to Donnan the SRC rules regarding use
               of the sound system and room bookings. Donnan was told by us
               that he needed to leave the SRC for the night. If he returned
               he may be subject to arrest for trespass. Donnan left the
               building without incident. Case to be sent to WSU Student
               Conduct. No further investigation. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 1st day of
               March, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               ____NO OTHER UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 03/01/14 at
               approximately 2044 hours I was driving northbound on B St near
               California when I noticed a parked car facing southbound. The
               car, a Toyota Camry, had 7 females in it. As I neared the car I
               saw the female's passing a bottle around the car. When they saw
               my patrol car they quickly put the bottle on the floor board.
               When I passed the car the occupants that I could see appeared
               to be under the age of 21. I turned around and pulled behind
               the car. I put my spotlight on the car and walked up to the
               driver's window. There were no cars in front of the Camry and
               the driver had every opportunity to leave if she chose. The
               driver, later identified as Malle Marlene Schulz 10/18/94,
               rolled down the window. I identified myself and told Schulz she
               was being recorded. I asked Schulz why they were in her car
               drinking. Schulz said they were just hanging out. I again asked
               why they were drinking in her car. Schulz said they were
               drinking in the car before they went to a party. I asked Schulz
               if anybody in the car was over 21 year old and she said no. I
               asked to see what they were drinking and Schulz handed me a
               water bottle. I opened the top to the water bottle and could
               clearly smell the odor of intoxicants in the bottle. Schulz
               said the car and the alcohol was hers. I returned to my car and
               asked for a Pullman Officer to respond due to the call being in
               their jurisdiction. Ofc. Emerson arrived on scene and took over
               the call. Ofc. Emerson told me I could clear and I did so.

               over when we arrived and the suspects had already left the

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 03-02-14 at approximately 0006 hours,
               I responded to the CUB for a report of multiple fights in the
               ballroom. There was a philanthropy dance being held there. I
               arrived, activated my axon camera, and was told by the CUB
               staff that the fights were over and there was a female upstairs
               who possibly had a concussion. I asked Whitcom to stage medics
               while I went upstairs to check on the fights. I asked where the
               female was that had the concussion and was taken to Ilyasha
               Hood who was near the doors to the ballroom. I asked her to
               come speak with me and she did. I asked her what happened and
               she stated she had been dancing and then was pushed to the
               floor where she landed on her butt. I asked her if she had been
               hit and she said no. I asked her why I was told she might have
               a concussion and she said she didn't know and was fine. I asked
               her if she knew who was fighting and she said no. I then spoke
               to Francisco Carriedo who stated there had been several
               individuals fighting and Ilyasha had been pushed to the floor
               and he saw her hit her head very hard on the floor. I asked if
               he knew who the subjects involved in the fight were and he
               stated he believed one of them was Teondray Caldwell. I asked
               him why he thought that and he stated the male was a football
               player wearing a baseball jersey that had Caldwell printed on
               the back. He stated he was fairly sure the male was Teondray
               Caldwell. He said there was other football players too. I asked
               him if Caldwell had thrown a punch and he said no. He stated he
               saw Caldwell holding out his arms and making gestures stating
               he "had his boys backs". I asked Ilyasha to come with me
               downstairs so she could be examined by medics and she stated
               she didn't want to, but her friends helped me convince her to
               be looked at. I had medics come inside and they examined
               Ilyasha who refused to be transported. I talked with her
               friends who stated they had not seen the fight, but just the
               commotion and then found the two females on the floor. I was
               told by one of them another female had been punched in the
               head, but didn't know where she was and would not say her name.
               I asked them to try and locate her and have her seek medical

               help since she was hit in the head and they stated they would.
               Unable to find anyone who saw who threw the punches or identify
               the suspects, I cleared. I called Caldwell's cell phone number
               and he answered but there was a lot of background noise and
               once I identified myself, he hung up. I called back and left
               him a voicemail asking him to contact me. We were then called
               back to the CUB for an unconscious female and found Ilyasha had
               passed out. I was approached by a CUB staff member while
               Ilyasha was being attended to my medics and told he had gotten
               a written statement from a witness. I asked him to get it for
               me and he did. The statement was from Oscar Sanchez who stated
               he saw a guy start a fight and two people tried to break it up.
               When they did the male started swinging and he punched a girl,
               then everyone jumped in and separated the group. He said the
               guy and his friends were kicked out of the dance. I did not
               meet with Sanchez, but will try and follow up with him later. I
               gave Ilyasha's friends my business card and asked them to
               contact me if they heard anything about the fight. I later went
               to PRH to speak with Ilyasha again, and was told the other
               female who was punched in the face was in the ER getting
               treatment. I contacted her and she was identified as Rita Best.
               Rita stated she had been on the dance floor when a black male
               with braids starting grabbing at her girlfriend, Marina Martin.
               She said he then started getting into the face of Maliek (she
               did not know his full name). She said she then remembers being
               pulled up off the floor by Marina and taken to the bathroom.
               Rita did not remember being hit. I could see she had swelling
               to the left side of her face and upper lip. She stated her left
               front tooth was also loose and she had a bloody nose. I asked
               her if Marina was at the hospital with her and she stated she
               was currently with Ilyasha. Rita stated she had been given my
               business card from Ilyasha's friends and Marina had left me a
               voicemail. I asked Rita if she had pushed or hit anyone and she
               said no. I looked at her hands and saw no trace of any marks. I
               asked her if she wanted to press charges against who hit her if
               I was able to determine who that was and she said yes. She told
               me that when the incident happened she was afraid to get in
               trouble and that is why she left. She stated she may have said
               something to the male, but did not hit him. She said she
               couldn't really remember what had happened, but just wanted to
               get out of there so they left. I asked her to talk to people
               who were at the dance and ask them if they saw who threw the
               punch. She stated she would. I asked her if I could take
               pictures of her face and she said yes. The pictures were later
               downloaded to Spillman. I then spoke to Marina and asked her
               what she saw. She stated they had been dancing and were getting
               ready to line up to "stroll" (a dance) when a male who she
               identified as Daquawn Brown began grabbing her butt and bumping
               into her. She said Rita began to step in and a fight broke out.
               She said she then found Rita on the floor and picked her up and
               dragged her out of the dance. She said she did not see who hit
               Rita, but when she pulled her up off the floor, Rita said she
               had been hit. I told Marina what I had said to Rita and told
               her to call if they were able to find out anymore information
               and she stated she would. I cleared PRH. I was later driving on

               Colorado when I saw Caldwell in the baseball jersey. I stopped
               and asked him if I could speak with him and he said yes. I
               asked him to tell me what happened at the CUB and at first he
               stated he hadn't been there. He then stated he had been at the
               dance and when a fight broke out he broke it up. I asked him
               who was involved in the fight and he stated he wasn't going to
               tell me. I spoke to him about what I had been told he was doing
               and he said he had just been breaking up the fight. I again
               tried to get him to say who was involved and he stated he
               wasn't going to tell me. I advised him I would be speaking with
               the coaches about the incident and he said, "go ahead". I
               cleared. I will have dayshift attempt to contact Omar, and
               Dequawn and interview them. Milford Hodge was contacted and
               advised of the involvement of the football players.

               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 2nd day of March,

               about 0220 hrs Dispatch advised of a call regarding a suicidal
               subject in Stephenson South. The subject was Alexis A. McCain
               (092594), the same subject from a previous alcohol overdose
               call. I contacted the complainant, Brittany A. Griffin
               (072689), who was the on call RED for Stephenson South. Griffin
               told me since I left from the alcohol call she was called by
               Keller three times regarding McCain. Each time Keller would
               tell Griffin that McCain was making statements about wanting to
               kill herself and heaing voices. Griffin said she spoke with
               McCain each time but McCain denied making the statements. I
               spoke to Keller who told me McCain said multiple times she
               "should just kill herself and make everything better". McCain
               also referenced hearing voices. I contacted McCain in room 517.
               She was laing on a bed, covered by a blanked. I said her name
               several times with no response. I touched her shoulder through
               the blanket, at which time she removed the blanket from her
               head and began speaking with me. I told McCain why I was there
               and that I had a camera that was recording. I asked if she was
               feeling like she wanted to hurt herself. She said no, that she
               just wanted to go to bed. I asked McCain why someone would tell
               me she had been making statements about wanting to kill herself
               and she said she didn't know. She denied saying anything about
               wanting to kill herself or hearing voices. McCain was still
               quite intoxicated. As I spoke to McCain she became increasingly
               agitated and angry. I told her I was concerned because of what
               I had been told. I told her I would like her to go to the
               hospital voluntarily to speak with someone. I told her if she
               didn't I would have to make her go to the hospital so I could
               be sure she was going to be safe. She continued to get
               increasingly agitated, becoming angry about the cost of the
               hospital and how her parents were going to get mad at her.
               McCain refused to go to the hospital voluntarily. I grabbed her
               right wrist and elbow and told her to turn around.McCain became
               physically resistive, saying she was not going to the hospital
               and tried to pull away from me. I performed a straight arm bar
               take down on McCain. She ended up face down on a mattress which
               was laying on the floor. She continued to be resistive, trying

               to roll over and pull away. I told her I was placing her in
               protective custody so I could take her to the hospital. I
               placed my right knee/shin across her upper back/right shoulder
               to keep her from rolling over and pulling away. At about this
               time I asked for an additional officer to respond. I told her
               to put her left arm on her back and she refused. I told her to
               stop resisting, because she was still tensing up her right arm
               and was refusing to move her left arm. She complained of pain
               from my kneeling on her back and holding her right arm behind
               her back. I told her if she quit resisting I would be able to
               move her to a more comfortable position. She moved her left arm
               behind her back at that time and I placed her in handcuffs
               (double locked). McCain calmed down some so I stood her up and
               was going to have her sit in a chair in the room so I could
               collect some warmer clothes for her before taking her outside.
               Before I could do that she became agitated again and resistive.
               I immideately escorted her out of the room and to the elevator.
               As we were waiting for the elevator McCain continued to yell at
               me and kicked the mirror outside the elevator. I told her if
               she damaged any property things would progress to criminal
               charges. I walked McCain down to my patrol car where I met
               Corporal Daniels as she was coming into the building. I asked
               her to speak with Keller and get a more complete statement from
               her. I transported McCain to PRH. While en-route to PRH McCain
               continued to yell at me. As she was doing so she indicated she
               had been to the hosptial before and that she "had problems".
               She said she drank to deal with her problems. Once at PRH I
               escorted her inside and signed the Release of Adult Protective
               Custody form. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
