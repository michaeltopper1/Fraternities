               NARRATIVE: On 03/28/14 at approximately 1215 hours I was
               dispatched to Streit Hall for a civil standby. I met the
               reporting party, Rita Best. Best explained to me that she broke
               up with her girlfriend Marina Martin and needed to retrieve
               items from her room. Ofc. Stewart began looking for Martin to
               arrange the pick up. While waiting with Best she explained to
               me that Marina said she was going to call the police because
               Best is harassing her via text messages. Best showed me a long
               line of texts between her and Marina. It appeared the text
               messaging was mutual and nothing stood out as criminal to me.
               At this time Whitcom advised that Marina was on the phone
               reporting being harassed via text messages and phone calls by
               Best. Ofc. Stewart met with Marina at Holland Library and also
               determined the texting was mutual and the messages contained
               nothing criminal in nature. Ofc. Stewart returned to Streit
               Hall 326 with Marina and I escorted Best to the room. I
               explained to both parties that I was recording and advised them
               that they are to be civil to each other during the pick up. We
               stood by for approximately 30 minutes while Best retrieved her
               items and left. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 28th day of

               N. Jones regarding a threatening instagram message she
               received. Upon arrival, I contacted Jones who told me the
               following. On 032814 at approximately 0530 hours, she woke up
               and noticed she had received a threatening Instagram message on
               her phone. Jones told me that the message stated the following
               bullet statements, "How do you live with yourself? You should
               die because you are a dirty whore. You fucked the whole
               football team. You are gross." Jones was crying and felt that
               the statements were a threat against her life and she didn't
               feel safe in her room. I told her that she should go wherever
               she feels safe and she told me she was going to stay with Kalia
               M. Jandoc for the weekend. Jones also told me her mother is
               coming to Pullman and she was probably going to go back home. I
               asked Jones if she knew who sent the message. She stated that
               the message was sent anonymously and promptly deleted after she
               read the message. Jones told me that Instagram has a feature
               where the person who posted the targeted message can see when
               she read the message. Jones also told me that around
               Thanksgiving time of 2013, she received a message from an
               anonymous person stating, "Your body count is 15, and you
               fucked the whole football team." Jones told me she didn't
               report the incident in November, but felt it could be the same
               person. I asked Jones if she has any idea who may have posted
               the message and she told me she didn't. I explained that I was
               going to contact Instagram and find out if I could obtain any
               information that had been deleted and to have her call if there
               was any new developments in the case over the weekend. Jones
               told me she would. I returned to WSU Police Department and sent
               an email to the Law Enforcement Instagram email account
               requesting information and a phone call. Case pending further
               investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing

               NARRATIVE: On 03/29/14 at about 0008 hrs Dispatch advised of a
               WSU Housing employee who was calling to report some suspicious
               circumstances. I contacted the complainant, Lisa Feltis
               (060859). I asked Feltis to tell me what was going on regarding
               the suspicious circumstances and she started by telling me a
               somewhat rambling story about what she has been doing at work
               for the previous week. She finally told me about two incidents
               involving students living at Terrace Apartments. The first
               student lives in apartment 113 and was complaining about a slow
               internet connection. When the technician was sent out to check
               on the internet they determined the internet connection was
               fine so Feltis called and told the student that. She later
               received a call from another student at Terrace apartments
               #311. She thought it was very suspicious she received a call
               from both apartments 113 and 311. The second individual was
               locked out of his apartment and when she asked his name he
               provided a last name of Hossain. He was very "dodgy" when she
               asked if he was in front of his apartment at the time. She
               later discovered his last name also included a much longer 2nd
               last name. I explained to Feltis that I did not believe any of
               this behavior was very unusual but told her I would document
               the incident for her. Nothing further. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 03-29-14, Whitcom dispatched me to a
               noise complaint at the Nez Perce apartments. Whitcom advised
               they received a complaint about loud music coming from
               apartment Q71. Officer Boyd and I responded. Upon our arrival,
               we could hear loud music playing in apartment Q71. Officer Boyd
               went to the back of the apartment and I knocked on the front
               door. A white male; later identified as Kevin J. Spiva (05-07-
               93), answered the door. Just prior to the door opening the
               music was turned down. I asked Spiva if he lived in the
               apartment and he said he did. I advised him I was there due to
               a noise complaint regarding the loud music. He said he was
               sorry and would not turn the music up again. I asked Spiva if
               he could get his ID so I could verify who I was speaking to and
               he handed me his WADL. I asked Whitcom to run him and they
               stated he was clear. I handed his WADL back to him and informed
               him if I had to return due to loud noise he was subject to
               being fined. He said he understood. Officer Boyd and I cleared.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 29th day of March, 2014, in
               Pullman, Washington. _______________________________________

               03/25/14 at about 0225 hrs I was driving westbound on Colorado
               St. passing the lower soccer field when I noticed a vehicle
               that was driving eastbound on Colorado St. The vehicle, WA
               AHK9523, caught my attention because it's bright headlights
               were on and made it very difficult to see. I turned around
               after the vehicle passed my location and as I was catching up
               to the vehicle to initiate a traffic stop noticed it had a
               white light showing to the rear due to a broken driver's side
               tail light lens. I initiated a traffic stop on the vehicle,
               turning on my overhead lights. The vehicle stopped on Colorado
               St. near the field house. I contacted the driver, Robin M.
               Waithaka (020792). I told him the reason for the stop and the
               stop was being recorded. I asked Waithaka for his driver's
               license, vehicle registration, and proof of insurance. He
               provided the requested information. As I was speaking with
               Waithaka I could smell a faint odor of intoxicants. I was
               suffering from a sinus cold at the time and had difficulty
               distinguishing exactly how strong the odor was. I noticed
               Waithaka had bloodshot and watery eyes and appeared to be very
               nervous. The driver's license Waithaka provided to me had a
               diamond hole punch in it, indicating a previous arrest for DUI.
               I asked how much he had to drink earlier in the night and
               Waithaka admitted to having had, "one shot". I asked Waithaka
               to exit the vehicle and move to the nearby sidewalk so I could
               speak with him and he did so. I asked him again how much
               alcohol he had to drink and this time he admitted to having had
               one shot and "a couple beers". I asked if he would be willing
               to perform a series of voluntary field sobriety tests so I
               could make sure he was not impaired and he refused. I asked if
               he would submit to a portable breath test and he refused. I ran
               Waithaka through Dispatch, who advised his driving status was
               suspended in the 3rd degree. I told Waithaka he was under
               arrest for DWLS 3rd degree and placed him in handcuffs (double
               locked). I advised him of his right to remain silent and his
               right to an attorney. I placed Waithaka in the back of my
               patrol car. He asked if he was going to jail and I told him I
               would be citing him and releasing him for driving with a

               suspended license. With Waithaka in the back of the patrol car
               I could tell the odor of intoxicants was much stronger but
               still had difficulty telling exactly how strong it was. I told
               Waithaka I suspected he was probably over the legal limit to
               drive in Washington and he was lucky he was not being arrested
               for his second DUI. I issued Waithaka criminal citation
               #4Z0166640 for DWLS 3rd degree. As I was completing the
               citation Waithaka complained about how much he had been through
               with his previous DUI and wanted me to let him off with a
               warning. I explained to Waithaka that obviously he had not
               learned his lesson the first time if he was continuing to drive
               after drinking. I explained the citation to Waithaka, he
               received his copy, and was released. One of Waithaka's
               passengers who was sober and had a valid license drove the
               vehicle from the scene. Nothing further. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               29 day of March, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.
