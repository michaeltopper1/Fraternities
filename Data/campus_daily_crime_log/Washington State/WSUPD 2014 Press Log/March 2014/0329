               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 03-29-2014 at about 1104 hrs I was
               dispatched to a report of harassment at the Student Recreation
               Center (SRC), located at 1105 NE North Fairway Road. Corporal
               Kuhrt and I arrived on scene and contacted the following
               individuals: Karl J. Dubeau (DOB 05-21-1992), Cameron A. Adams
               (DOB 06-28-1991), Keoki K. Mawae (DOB 02-17-1990), and Kirsten
               N. Schumacher (DOB 05-30-1990). All of these individuals are
               SRC employees. Dubeau and Adams told me that a patron at the
               SRC, later identified as Jazmine M. Perkins (DOB 10-21-1989),
               had made some threatening statements. Dubeau explained that
               Perkins was conducting basketball classes for children on the
               basketball court and was charging money for her instruction.
               Dubeau told me that Perkins had not made the required
               arrangements with WSU University Recreation in order to conduct
               the training at the SRC. Dubeau and Adams contacted Perkins
               about this issue, and she became hostile and uncooperative.
               During his conversation with Perkins, Dubeau told me that she
               said something like, "if I see you outside, it would be
               different". Dubeau said he decided to call the police to assist
               with Perkins. Mawae and Schumacher witnessed the incident,
               however, they thought Perkins told Dubeau and Adams that she
               would have "beat their asses" if they were outside. I asked
               Dubeau and Adams to explain how they felt about the threatening
               statements made by Perkins. Dubeau and Adams told me they were
               not concerned and did not feel threatened. Adams stated that
               his impression was that Perkins made the statements during the
               "heat of the moment". Both Dubeau and Adams stated that they
               did not want to pursue criminal charges against Perkins. Adams
               was the supervisor at the SRC and advised that he wanted
               Perkins trespassed from the premises for the remainder of the
               day. Adams said Perkins could return to the SRC tomorrow.
               Corporal Kuhrt and I contacted Perkins and another male, who
               was identified as Jabari A. Watkins (DOB 11-30-1986), on the
               basketball court. Watkins stated that he was Perkins' manager.
               I questioned Perkins about the threatening statements she made
               towards Dubeau and Adams. Perkins denied making the statements
               and told me that the SRC staff was rude to her. I explained the

               statements towards others. I advised Perkins that she was
               trespassed from the SRC for the rest of today, and if she
               returned, she could be arrested for criminal trespass. Perkins
               acknowledged that she understood this restriction. Perkins and
               Watkins left the building, and Corporal Kuhrt and I cleared the
               scene. No further action at this time. Olmstead/339 I certify

               approximately 1535 hours I was dispatched to a possible
               domestic dispute at the playfields on Valley Rd. The reporting
               party, Ernest Durham, told Whitcom that his ex-wife (Roxanna
               Durham) had thrown a shirt and shoes at him. I arrived on scene
               and met with Ernest. I activated my VieVu camera. I asked
               Ernest to tell me what happened. Ernest explained that he was
               meeting his wife to pick up his kids since he had them for
               Spring Break. Ernest said his son Dawson was taking part in a
               baseball tryout at the playfields. Ernest explained that when
               he asked Roxanna for Dawson's shirt and shoes she threw him at
               him. Ernest said the shirt hit him in the face and the shoe
               "kinda went by him". I asked Ernest if it hurt when the shoe
               hit him and he said no. I could not see any marks on his face
               either. Ernest was very upset about the situation and asked
               what I was going to do about it. I asked Ernest what he wanted
               me to do about it. Ernest asked that I do whatever I could. I
               explained the mandatory arrest law pertaining to assault and
               domestic violence. I told Ernest that this did not fall under
               those realms. I further told Ernest that an assault did occur,
               but it was very minor. I told Ernest I felt the best response
               from me would be to talk with Roxanna and forward the case to
               the prosecutor's office. I asked Ernest if anyone else was
               around when this happened and he said all three kids as well as
               Roxanna's attorney, Jim Siebe. I asked Ernest where his kids
               were. Ernest said they were at his van in the parking lot (near
               the intersection of NE Merman and NE Valley Rd.). I told Ernest
               to meet me at his vehicle. I responded to Ernest's vehicle and
               met with his son Winston (before Ernest spoke with him). I
               asked Winston to tell me what happened. Winston said that he
               was standing at the front of Roxanna's car (he indicated he was
               near the front passenger headlight). Winston said that Dawson
               was in the front passenger seat of the car and Roxanna was
               standing in the area of the open passenger door. Winston said
               that Ernest walked to the front quarter panel area on the
               passenger side of Roxanna's vehicle and asked Roxanna for
               Dawson's sweatshirt and shoes. Winston said Roxanna threw the

               items over the top of the car and a shoe hit him, and the other
               one landed on the ground. I asked Winston if it hurt and he
               said no. I asked Winston if it appeared that Roxanna was
               throwing the items at anyone in particular and he said no.
               Winston said "it probably hit him by chance". After Winston
               said his side of the story Ernest told him that he got hit in
               the face with the shirt. I provided Ernest with my business
               card and a DV pamphlet. Ofc. Olmstead arrived on scene around
               this time. I went to Roxanna's vehicle and asked Whitcom to
               call her and have her respond to her vehicle to speak with me.
               Roxanna and Siebe came to my location. I asked Roxanna to tell
               me what happened. Roxanna gave me a similar account of what
               happened. Roxanna said that she did throw the items over the
               top of the door and they landed on the ground. I asked Roxanna
               if any items hit them and she said she did not think so.
               Roxanna and Siebe told me about past history between Roxanna
               and Ernest, which all seemed to have occurred in Idaho. Roxanna
               said Ernest threatened her in the parking lot. I asked her what
               she meant and she said Ernest threatened to call the police and
               just has an intimidating demeanor towards her. I asked if
               Ernest threatened her verbally to cause harm in any way and she
               said no. I explained to them that I would be forwarding the
               case to the prosecutor's office. I told Roxanna and Siebe that
               they could remain at the field, but they needed to be civil and
               keep their distance from each other and they said they could. I
               provided Roxanna with my business card and case number. As I
               was leaving the area I saw Siebe walk over to Ernest's car,
               which Dawson and his sister were in. I stopped on Valley Rd.
               and watched as Dawson handed a bag of what appeared to be
               clothes out the sun roof to Siebe. I then heard Siebe ask
               Dawson "Do you know why your dad called the cops on your mom?"
               I yelled at Siebe to not make the situation worse and to walk
               away, which he did. I had Ofc. Petlovany respond to the area
               and stay on scene to ensure nothing else happened, which he did
               and nothing happened. I saved the video footage to the
               computer. Case forwarded to prosecutor's office. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               hrs I was driving southbound on Stadium Way approaching Grimes
               Way when I noticed a vehicle driving northbound on Stadium Way.
               The vehicle caught my attention because it appeared to be
               driving faster than the posted 20 MPH speed limit. I activated
               my police traffic radar unit (VH 7) which emitted a high
               pitched audio doppler tone. The tone was steady in pitch. I
               observed a display of 30 MPH on the radar device. The vehicle
               was the only moving vehicle in the radar field at the time of
               the readings. The calibration of the radar unit was checked
               both before and after the stop by the use of factory certified
               tuning forks. I turned around and initiated a traffic stop on
               the vehicle, turning on my overhead lights. The vehicle stopped
               on Wilson Rd. just off Stadium Way. I contacted the driver,
               later identified as Ruslan V. Kuzmich (072795). I told him the
               reason for the stop and the stop was being recorded. I asked
               Kuzmich for his driver's license, vehicle registration, and
               proof of insurance. He provided the requested information. When
               Kuzmich handed me the registration it was folded up. I unfolded
               the registration and found marijuana inside the folded
               registration. Kuzmich's driver's license indicated he was under
               the age of 21. I had Kuzmich step out of the vehicle. Kuzmich
               told me the marijuana was probably left by his cousins over
               spring break. Dispatch advised Kuzmich had two previous
               warnings in Spillman for marijuana. I asked Kuzmich if he had
               any more marijuana in the vehicle and he said he did not. He
               told me I could check if I wanted to. I checked the vehicle and
               found no other contraband. I had Kuzmich and his passenger, Jan
               C. Wolfisberg (060695), return to the vehicle. I advised
               Kuzmich he was under arrest for possession of marijuana less
               than 40 grams. I advised him of his right to remain silent and
               his right to an attorney. I told him to remain in the vehicle
               while I completed a citation. I issued Kuzmich criminal
               citation #4Z0166642 for possession of marijuana less than 40
               grams. I explained the citation to him, he received his copy,
               and was released. I gave Kuzmich a verbal warning for speed.
               The marijuana from the registration was logged as evidence.

               March 29th, 2014 at approximately 2158 hours I was driving
               northbound on Opal Street approaching Colorado Street when I
               noticed a white BMW traveling westbound on Colorado St. When
               the driver was approaching the stop sign at Colorado and Opal,
               the driver did not even slow slightly before turning quickly
               left onto Opal St. The driver made no attempt to stop for the
               stop sign. The BMW was now heading directly right at me. I
               turned on my emergency lights and came to a stop straddling the
               center line. I was half in my lane and half in the BMW's lane.
               I thought this would make the BMW stop but he swerved around
               me. Just as the BMW was passing me I could hear the car's
               engine downshift and start to accelerate quickly away from me.
               I turned around and went after the car. I caught up to the BMW
               about a block later and turned on my siren. The BMW quickly
               turned left down the alley between Campus and Oak Street just
               off Opal Street. The driver pulled into a dirt parking spot and
               came to a stop. As I was putting my patrol car into park the
               driver jumped out of his car and started walking towards me.
               Not knowing the driver's attentions, I drew my gun and ordered
               the driver to put his hands up. The driver complied and I saw
               only keys in his hands. I told the driver to turn away from me
               which he did. I handcuffed (D/L) the driver due to his
               behavior. While handcuffing the driver I could smell the
               overpowering odor of intoxicants coming from his breath. I
               asked the driver, later identified as Elliot Micahel Price
               10/02/91, why he jumped out of his car. Price said he was
               scared. I asked Price if he had his ID with him and he said it
               was in his wallet which was in his back pocket. I asked if I
               could remove it and he said I could. I found Price's Washington
               Driver's License in his wallet. I asked Price why he did not
               stop when he saw me in his lane of travel with my emergency
               lights on. Price said he did not see my siren. I told Price
               that he cannot see my siren since you can only hear it. Price

               arrived on scene. When Ofc. Petlovany arrived I noticed that I
               had forgotten my VieVu camera. I borrowed Ofc. Petlovany's

               Price how much he had to drink tonight. Price said, "nothing."
               I asked Price if he was willing to do some voluntary field
               sobriety tests and he said he would. I unhandcuffed Price so he
               could perform the tests. The tests were conducted on the level
               compact dirt alleyway. Price was wearing a jacket, sweatshirt,
               jeans and tennis shoes at the time of the tests. The alleyway
               was lit by street lights, patrol car spot light, and personal
               flashlight. I explained to Price that I would be evaluating him
               on how well he followed my instructions as well as how well he
               performed the tests. The first test I administered was the HGN
               test. I instructed Price to stand with his heels and toes
               together and keep his arms at his sides. I told Price to remain
               in that position while I administered the test. Price stated he
               understood. I told Price to follow the tip of my pen with his
               eyes only and not to move his head. I held my pen approximately
               12-15 inches away from Price's head. During the test I
               observed, equal pupil size, equal tracking, lack of smooth
               pursuit, distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation,
               and onset of nystagmus prior to 45 degrees in both eyes. I had
               to remind Price not to move his head several times. The next
               test I administered was the walk and turn. I told price to
               place his left foot on an imaginary line before him. I then
               instructed Price to place his right foot heel to toe in front
               of his left foot and keep his arms at his side. Price got into
               the starting position as instructed. I told Price to remain in
               that position as I gave further instructions. I told Price,
               when I tell you to begin, don't begin until I tell you, you
               will take a series of nine heel to toe steps down the line,
               with your arms at your side, looking down at your feet, and
               counting your steps out loud. Once you reach your ninth step
               leave your lead foot planted and with your rear foot take a
               series of small steps until you are facing where you came from
               and again take nine return heel to toe steps. I demonstrated
               the test for Price. I reminded Price to keep his arms at his
               side, count his steps out loud, look down at his feet, and do
               not stop the test until he had completed it. I asked Price if
               he understood and Price said he did. I told Price he could
               begin as soon as he was ready. Instruction Phase: Price was
               swaying side to side but did not step out of the starting
               position. First Nine Steps: On step 3 Price stumbled causing
               him to step off line. On step 7 Price missed heel to toe. Price
               took a total of 10 steps but did not count his 10th step out
               loud. Price incorrectly turned by pivoting on the balls of both
               his feet. Return Nine Steps: Price missed heel to toe on his
               9th step. The next test I administered was the One Leg Stand. I
               instructed Price to stand with his heels and toes together and
               keep his arms at his side. I told Price to remain in that
               position while I gave him further instructions. I told Price,
               when I tell you to begin, don't begin until I tell you, you
               will raise either leg of your choice and raise it six inches
               off the ground. You must point your toe so the sole of your
               shoe is parallel with the ground. While pointing your toe, keep
               your arms at your side, leg straight, look down at your foot
               and count out loud, one thousand one, one thousand two, one
               thousand three, and so on until I tell you to stop. If at any

               point you put your foot down, go ahead and pick it right back
               up and continue counting where ever you left off. I
               demonstrated the test and asked Price if he understood and he
               stated yes. I told Price to begin. Price raised his right leg
               and began the test. Price was counting 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. not
               as I had instructed him to do so. Just shortly after starting
               the test Price was hopping and moving around to keep his
               balance. At "10" I told Price to look at his foot because he
               had not been doing so. Price counted to 26 in the 30 seconds. I
               told Price that the last test I had for him was the PBT. I
               explained what the PBT was, that it was voluntary, and it did
               not replace the evidentiary breath test. I found my PBT (Alco-
               Sensor FST #16805) in working condition. When I tried to get a
               PBT sample from Price, he put his lips around the tube but did
               not blow. I again told Price how to provide a sample. I tried
               again to get a PBT sample. This time Price barely blew into the
               breath tube and I had to manually click the PBT after less than
               a second. Price provided a very weak sample of .139. I told
               Price that he was under arrest for DUI and handcuffed (D/L)
               him. I advised Price of his right to counsel and walked Price
               over to my patrol car where he was searched incident to arrest.
               Nothing of evidentiary value was found. I told price that his
               vehicle was going to be towed and wanted to know if there was
               anything in the car he wanted out of it. Price asked for his
               cell phone. While retrieving the cell phone, I noticed an open
               can of beer on the passenger's side floorboard. Ofc. Petlovany
               stayed with the vehicle and I transported Price to Pullman
               Police Department for BAC. Upon arrival I checked the
               Datamaster and found it working properly, with the RFI antenna
               attached, the mouth tube warm to the touch, and a temperature
               within ranges. At 2225 hours I checked Price's mouth. Price
               removed chewing tobacco and threw it away. There was no other
               foreign items in his mouth. I read Price his Constitutional
               Rights at 2227 hours. Price stated he understood his rights and
               signed he understood his rights and decided not to exercise his
               rights. I read Price the Implied Consent Warning for Breath and
               Price signed that it had been read to him at 2229 hours. Price
               stated he was willing to provide a breath sample. Price
               provided a breath sample of .163 at 2244 hours and another
               sample of .181 at 2247 hours. The breath test was administered
               in accordance to the methods approved by the Washington State
               Toxicologist pursuant to the Washington Administrative Code. I
               provided Price a copy of the following documents: Driver's
               Hearing Request, Fee Waiver form, Notice of Hearing/Conditions
               of Release, tow and impound form, and the breath test document.
               Price was issued Sector Citation 4Z0393039 for RCW 46.61.502
               DUI. Price was also issued NOI's for failure to stop at the
               stop sign and having an open alcohol container in his vehicle.
               I explained the citations and provided him with his copies.
               Price was finger printed and photographed. Price's vehicle was
               impounded by Auto Body Super Center for 12 hours. My VieVu
               camera footage was uploaded to the department's computer.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 30th day of March, 2014, in

               NARRATIVE: On 03/29/14 at approximately 2336 hours, I was
               driving eastbound on Colorado Street near the Old Bookie
               loading dock when I noticed two females walking eastbound on
               the sidewalk. One female, later identified as Katie Anne
               Sherman 03/20/95, grabbed my attention over the other. Sherman
               was stumbling side to side as she walking causing her to bump
               several times into her friend. Sherman was stumbling to the
               point that one time she crossed her legs and stumbled over them
               while trying to walk forward. As I passed the two females I
               noticed they both appeared to be under the age of 21. I pulled
               into the area of the Holland Parking Garage out of sight. I
               waited on the side walk until the two reached where I was
               standing. When the two females reached me, I asked them if they
               had second to talk. Both stopped and I told Sherman that I was
               wanting to specifically talk with her. I explained what I had
               observed and Sherman's friend (not identified) said Sherman had
               just had knee surgery and that was why she was stumbling. When
               Sherman's friend said that, I remembered arresting Sherman on
               02/23/14 (case 14-W0742) because her friend had said the exact
               same thing that time. I asked Sherman if had arrested her for
               MIP recently. Sherman thought about it and then said yes. I
               asked Sherman why she was out drinking if I had just recently
               arrested her. Sherman said she was not drinking. Sherman then
               changed her story and said she had a few drinks when I asked
               her about it again. I asked Sherman if I could check her eyes
               and she said I could. I performed an HGN test on Sherman.
               During the test I observed, equal tracking, lack of smooth
               pursuit, and distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum
               deviation. Sherman's eyes were bloodshot and watery. During the
               test Sherman was swaying side to side. I could smell the odor
               of intoxicants coming from Sherman's breath as she stood before
               me. I asked Sherman several questions to determine her mental
               status. Sherman was able to answer all my questions except for
               who the president of the United States was. Sherman answered
               "Bush" as the President. I told Sherman that she was under
               arrest for MIP and handcuffed (D/L) her. I advised Sherman of
               her right to counsel. Sherman was searched incident to arrest

               and no weapons or items of evidentiary value were found. I
               transported Sherman to the Pullman Holding Facility where
               Sherman was fingerprinted and photographed. I issued Sherman a
               Sector citation for RCW 66.44.270.2B MIP Exhibiting. I
               explained the citation to Sherman and provided her with her
               copy. Sherman told me that she is currently in the diversion
               program from the last time I had arrested her. I told Sherman
               that this would violate the terms of her diversion program. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 31st day of March, 2014, in Pullman,

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 033014 at approximately 0018 hours I
               was driving westbound on Wilson Rd, approaching Stadium Way
               when I observed a silver vehicle (WA/AET3512) traveling north
               through the intersection at a speed that appeared to be in
               excess of the posted 20 mph. I verified the calibration of my
               radar in vehicle 17 before and after the stop. I turned onto
               northbound Stadium Way and caught up with the vehicle and
               turned on my radar to measure my speed as I paced the vehicle.
               I was moving at 30 mph and above before activating my emergency
               lights. My Vievue camera was activated at this time and the
               radar readout is visible in the screen. I also noted the
               vehicle had caught up to a vehicle in front that appeared to
               being moving at the posted speed limit. I activated my
               emergency lights and stopped the vehicle. I contacted the
               driver, identified as Joshua S. Burnette (060593), and informed
               him we were being recorded. Burnette did not know why I had
               stopped him and he thought the speed limit was 25 mph. He then
               went on a rambling regarding trying to get home, attending WSU,
               and his relatives. I could smell the odors of marijuana and
               intoxicants coming from the vehicle. Burnette's eyes were
               watery. I had him speak with me on the sidewalk. He admitted to
               having smoked marijuana and drank within the last 2 hours. He
               then wanted to tell me about a collision in which his friend
               was in recently. According to Burnette, his friend was still in
               a coma as a result of driving impaired. I could smell the odor
               of intoxicants on his breath. He said he would do voluntary
               SFST's and then told me he played defensive end for WSU last
               year. Burnette stated he had no injuries, "20/20" vision, no
               epilepsy, nor diabetes. HGN Test I informed him that he would
               be following my pen with his eyes. I instructed him to keep his
               head still, keep his arms at his sides, keep his feet together,
               and to follow my pen with his eyes. I verified that his pupils
               were equal and that his eyes were able to track my pen equally.
               I tested for HGN and found a lack of smooth pursuit in both
               eyes. Burnette did display a distinct and sustained nystagmus
               at maximum deviation. I did see an onset of nystagmus prior to

               did not observe anything of note. Walk and Turn Test I
               instructed Burnette to place his heels together, his toes
               together, keeping his arms at his sides. I explained to him
               that he was to imagine a straight line coming out of his left
               foot and to place his right foot on that line, heel to toe. He
               was then told not to begin the rest of the test until
               instructed to do so, but to stay in the position he was in. I
               then told him he would take nine heel to toe steps down the
               line, then leave the front foot on the straight line, and take
               a series of small steps around that foot. He would then take 9
               more steps back down the straight line. He was instructed to
               keep his arms down at his sides, watch his feet, and count his
               steps out loud. I asked him if he understood and he said he
               did. I demonstrated the test, taking 3 steps out, turning, and
               taking 3 steps back. I repeatedly explained that he would be
               taking 9 steps while I was showing him 3 steps. Burnette
               stumbled offline on his second step, he then continued to
               stumble/trip on his feet every other step or so. He was walking
               on a level and lit sidewalk. He missed heel to toe contact
               twice on his return nine steps. He lost his balance on his
               turn. Burnette used his arms for balance. One Leg Stand Test I
               instructed Burnette to place his heels together and his toes
               together and his arms at his sides. I told him to stay in this
               position until I told him to begin the test. I explained to him
               that he could choose either leg to raise 6 inches off the
               ground, but that both legs needed to remain straight. I told
               him that he needed to point his raised foot and to keep his
               eyes on that foot while he counted out loud 1001, 1002, 1003
               and so on, until told to stop. If his foot were to touch the
               ground he was instructed to pick his foot back up and to resume
               counting where he left off. He was told to keep his arms down
               at his sides. I asked him if he understood and he said he did.
               I demonstrated the test for him. Burnette stood on his left
               foot. He started the test with his foot approximately 2 inches
               off the ground and he was not pointing his foot. I reminded him
               of this and he had to hop to maintain his balance and then put
               his foot down. He used his arms for balance. He counted "1, 2,
               3" and so on. He needed to hop more once resuming and he put
               his foot down again. He began his count over at 1. I told
               Burnette the next test would be the PBT, I informed him it was
               voluntary and it did not replace the evidentiary breath test.
               At approximately 0031 hours Burnette provided a breath sample
               that registered .159 on PBT #049027. Burnette was placed under
               arrest for Driving Under the Influence (DUI), informed of his
               full Miranda rights, and searched incident to arrest, by Intern
               Bonjukian as he was with Ofc. Boyd who had arrived as backup.
               Ofc. Boyd created the tow form and stayed on scene to handle
               the tow. Burnette was handcuffed and transported him to Pullman
               PD for processing. At the facility I reminded him he was being
               recorded. At 0052 hours I read Burnette his constitutional
               rights and he signed the form. At 0053 hours I read him the
               implied consent warning for breath. I asked him if was willing
               to provide 2 breath samples and he said he would. He then asked
               me what I would do and I told him I could not advise him. I
               offered to read or let him read the information again but he

               declined. He did not request counsel. At 0051 hours I checked
               Burnette's mouth and found no foreign substances. During the 15
               minute observation period, I observed Burnette the entire time
               and he did not vomit, eat, smoke, drink, or place anything in
               his mouth. Burnette did complete the DUI interview I checked
               that the breath tube was warm to the touch, the machine was on,
               the antenna was attached, and the sim, temperature was within
               34c +/- .3c. At 0116 hours he provided his first sample and a
               reading of .136 was recorded. At 0119 hours Burnette provided
               his second sample and a reading of .150 was recorded. Burnette
               then used the restroom. When the test document was printed I
               signed and explained the results to Burnette. I explained to
               him his Notice Of Hearing/Conditions of Release, Driver's
               Hearing Request Information and Fee Waiver Request. Ofc. Boyd
               dropped off Burnette's tow information and I placed it in his
               property. Burnette and I went over his property inventory sheet
               and he signed it. I then placed Burnette in a holding cell. I
               went to my patrol car and completed Sector citation # 4Z0321323
               for DUI. I did not write an infraction. I placed the citation
               with Burnette's belongings. I returned to the station and spoke
               with Ofc. Westerman, informing of what I had done and what I
               needed him to do before releasing Burnette. I also verified
               that Burnette was not listed on WSU Football's Spring Roster.
               He was also not listed on the WSU directory as a student. Upon
               returning to work later in the day I found Burnette's
               fingerprinting documents in the case file. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               30th day of March of 2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               03/30/14 at approximately 0036 hours I was notified of a
               Reckless Endangerment call that was holding. Once I cleared a
               DUI investigation I took the call and called the reporting
               party. The reporting party, Riley T. Howard 03/17/93, said he
               was walking down the sidewalk of Colorado Street next to
               Northside Hall. When Howard reached the southeast corner of
               Northside Hall someone in the 3rd floor study lounge threw a
               liquid out the open window and onto him. Howard described the
               liquid to be white in color, odorless, and tasteless. Howard
               said he thought the liquid to be milk but was not 100% sure.
               Howard said he was very wet from the liquid and believed that
               the amount was a little bit more than a glass full. Howard
               stated he did not see anybody in the study lounge and did not
               hear any voices. Howard also stated that he was not hurt and
               did not have any reaction to the liquid. As I was responding to
               the area of Northside a Delta response breathing call came in.
               I was the only Officer able to respond and I did so. Once I
               completed the breathing call I returned to Northside Hall and
               found a wet spot on the concrete where Howard had described. I
               also could see an open window leading to the 3rd floor study
               lounge. There was nobody in the lounge. With no suspect
               description and the time delay I cleared. Nothing further. I

               03/30/14 at approximately 0042 hours, I responded to Stephenson
               South room 1125 for a breathing call. Dispatch stated a female
               was not alert and breathing rapidly in room 1125. Just prior to
               my arrival, Dispatch stated they were in progress of trying to
               clear her airway. When I reached room 1125 I found an RA
               attending to the female, Monica Arellano Gutierrez 05/04/95.
               Monica was laying on her back with her eyes closed and
               breathing rapidly. I rolled Monica onto her side into the
               recovery position. I tried to get Monica to respond to me but
               she would not open her eyes or answer my questions. Monica was
               breathing and slightly nodded to a few questions. I asked the
               RA what happened. The RA (not identified) said that a male,
               Jose Guadalupe Hernandez O 07/02/90, had come to her room and
               said there was something wrong with Monica. The RA said she
               found Monica on her bed unresponsive so she called 911. I found
               out that Jose was Monica's boyfriend. Jose was able to answer a
               few questions but he spoke only a little bit of English. Jose
               said he called Monica a few times but she did not answer her
               cell phone. Jose came over to Monica's room to check on her and
               found her unresponsive. Jose did not know if Monica had taken
               any pills or not. When medics arrived I walked out into the
               hallway were Jose was speaking to another female who was
               speaking Spanish. The female translated for Jose. The female
               said Jose and Monica had just broken up earlier in the day and
               Monica had said something to the effect of, "I want to kill
               myself" to Jose. When Monica stopped answering her cell phone,
               Jose got worried and went to check on Monica. Jose did not know
               what Monica took. There were several over the counter pill
               bottles on the table next to Monica. The bottles were asprin
               and midol. Medics transported Monica to PRH and I cleared. This
               case was faxed to WSU Counseling Services on 03/30/14. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under

               NARRATIVE: On 03/30/14 at approximately 0117 hours, I was
               driving eastbound on Colorado Street near the Soccer Field when
               I noticed a male, later identified as Austin Robert Kanouse
               10/24/94, walking westbound on Colorado Street towards me. I
               instantly recognized Kanouse because I had arrested him on
               01/14/14 for MIP. Kanouse was stumbling side to side as he
               walked in a zig zag motion. Kanouse was covered in mud from his
               waist down. I knew Kanouse was only 19 years old from my prior
               contact with him. I contacted Kanouse and asked to speak with
               him. I asked Kanouse if he was ok and he said he was fine. I
               asked Kanouse why he was so muddy. Kanouse again said he was
               ok. Kanouse said he fell down around Northside Hall. I asked
               for Kanouse's for ID which he provided. I noticed Kanouse's
               knuckles were red and asked him if he had been in a fight.
               Kanouse said he had not. Kanouse said he only fell down. I
               asked Kanouse how much he had to drink tonight. Kanause said he
               had two shots. I asked Kanouse if I could check his eyes and he
               said I could. I performed an HGN test on Kanouse. During the
               test I observed, equal tracking, lack of smooth pursuit, and
               distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation. I could
               clearly smell the odor of intoxicants coming from Kanouse's
               breath as he stood before me. I asked Kanouse how long ago had
               I arrested him for MIP. Kanouse said, "not too long ago." I
               asked why he was out in public intoxicated again. Kanouse said
               he was invited to a party by his friends because it was his
               last week of school. I told Kanouse that he was under arrest
               for MIP and handcuffed (D/L) him. I Kanouse was searched
               incident to arrest. No weapons or items of evidentiary value
               were found. I transported Kanouse to the Pullman Holding
               Facility where he was fingerprinted and photographed. I issued
               Kanouse a Sector citation for RCW 66.44.270.2B MIP Exhibiting.
               I explained the citation to Kanouse and provided him with his
               copy. I provided Kanouse with a courtesy transport back to his
               dorm. Once at Northside Hall I dropped Kanouse off and cleared.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 31st day of March, 2014, in

               hrs I was driving westbound on Colorado St. passing WSU Parking
               services when I noticed a male, later identified as Nathan G.
               Hundeby (101194), who was walking eastbound along Colorado St.
               He caught my attention because he appeared to be under the age
               of 21 and was having difficulty walking, stumbling side to
               side. I drove down B St. and came back around on Thatuna Rd.
               Hundeby was continuing to walk along Colorado St. and was now
               near the lower soccer field. I stopped by the entrance to the
               Holland Library parking garage and walked across the street,
               where I contacted Hundeby. I asked Hundeby where he was going
               and he said to his dorm, Streit Hall. As Hundeby spoke I could
               smell the odor of intoxicants on his breath and noticed he had
               slurred speech. I asked how much he had to drink and he
               admitted to having had a couple beers. I asked how old he was
               and he said 19. He provided me with his Washington Driver's
               License which confirmed his age. I asked Hundeby if I could
               check his eyes to see how much he had to drink and he agreed. I
               administered a horizontal gaze nystagmus test on him. I
               observed a lack of smooth pursuit, a distinct and sustained
               nystagmus at maximum deviation, and an immediate onset of
               nystagmus. I asked if he would provide a breath sample on a PBT
               and he refused. I asked Hundeby if he had ever been arrested or
               warned by the police before and he said no. I told him I would
               be forwarding charges to the prosecutor for MIP exhibiting and
               he was released. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 30 day of
               March, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               I responded to a noise complaint at Chief Joseph Apartments
               unit C12. Upon arrival I could hear a lot of people and party
               noises coming from unit C12. The door was open to C12 when I
               walked up and there were several people coming and going from
               the residence. I told one person that I needed to speak to
               someone who lived here. Eventually Alexa Victoria Lenning
               03/31/94 and Stevie Katherine McClay 09/24/93 came to the door.
               Both said they were responsible for the apartment and party.
               While talking to Lenning and McClay I could smell the strong
               odor of marijuana coming from the apartment. I spoke with the
               two about MIP, Furnishing, Possession of Marijuana, and Noise.
               I explained the consequences of each and told them the party
               was over. Both females agreed and I cleared. Nothing further. I

               hrs I was driving on Stadium Way near North Fairway Rd when I
               noticed two females, who were walking southbound along Stadium
               Way. The females, later identified as Adriana L. Flores and

               Stephenson North. As I spoke to them I could smell a faint odor
               of intoxicants. I asked how much they had to drink. Flores
               admitted to having had a little bit while George denied having
               consumed alcohol. I asked if I could check their eyes to make
               sure and they both agreed. I administered a horizontal gaze
               nystagmus test on each of them. During the test I could smell
               the odor of alcohol on their breath. I noticed they both had
               bloodshot and watery eyes. They each displayed a lack of smooth
               pursuit. I told them that after speaking with them they were
               not as intoxicated as they appeared as I was driving by. I told
               them I could tell they had been consuming alcohol and would be
