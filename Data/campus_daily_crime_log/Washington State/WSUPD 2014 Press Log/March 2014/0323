               03/24/14 at approximately 0032 hours, I was dispatched to a
               drugs call at Stevens Hall room 32. Upon arrival I found the
               whole main floor hallway to smell strongly of marijuana. When I
               reached room 32 I could smell the odor coming from within the
               room. I smelled the door surrounding room 32 and it was clear
               that the odor was coming only from room 32. The odor was burnt
               marijuana leading me to believe that the marijuana had been
               smoked inside room 32. Hall staff told me that room 32 was
               assigned to Natasha Ann Sohn 10/13/94. Sohn is the only person
               assigned to room 32. I knocked on the door of room 32 for about
               5 minutes and nobody answered the door. While knocking on the
               door, Ofc. Petlovany called Sohn while I was standing outside
               and I was unable to hear a cell phone ringing inside the room.
               Sohn also did not answer her cell. The hall staff stated they
               did not know if Sohn was in the room or not. Sohn will be
               referred to student conduct for smoking marijuana in her room.
               I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws
               of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and

               NARRATIVE: On 03-24-14 at approximately 0538 hours, I received
               a third party report of a bathroom stall door found broken at
               Todd Hall near room 276. I responded and found the door was
               leaning against the wall. I could see a plastic piece used for
               the hinge on the bottom of the frame was broken. I could not
               see any other damage to the door. It is possible the plastic
               piece broke and it was not maliciously done. I was requested to
               provide the Fac Ops dispatcher the case number. I called her
               and she stated the door had been reported by a custodian who
               found it this morning. She stated the door had not been broken
               on Friday so it must have happened over the weekend. I advised
               her of what I saw and she stated she would put it on the work
               order. I took a photograph of the stall and downloaded it to
               Spillman. I cleared. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 24th day of March,
