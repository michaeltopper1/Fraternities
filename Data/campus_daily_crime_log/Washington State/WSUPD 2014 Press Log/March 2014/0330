               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 03-30-14, at approximately 1431
               hours, I was dispatched to the odor of marijuana emitting from
               within room 328 in Rogers Hall. Charles A. Beckers (07-17-86)
               is the "On Call" Residential Educational Director for Rogers
               Hall. Beckers responded to the third floor of Rogers Hall as
               the third floor Rogers Hall Resident Advisor smelled the odor
               of marijuana emitting from within room 328. Beckers verified he
               also smelled the odor of marijuana emitting from within the
               room. Beckers called Whitcom and asked to have a Police Officer
               respond. I responded to Rogers Hall and spoke with Beckers
               outside of the Hall. He said he smelled a very faint odor of
               marijuana emitting from within room 328. I responded to the
               third floor and walked to room 328. I could smell a faint odor
               of marijuana coming from the room so I knocked on the door. A
               white female; later identified as Krista Jo Flanagan (05-18-95)
               answered the door. As the door opened I observed Flanagan had
               blood shot eyes and her pupils were dilated. I asked Flanagan
               if she knew why I was at her door and she said she did not. I
               told her I was there because her room smelled like marijuana.
               She said something to the effect of "There is nothing in my
               room". I asked her if she would mind if I entered her room to
               check and she asked me if I had probable cause to enter the
               room. I told her there was a couple of ways we could deal with
               the situation and explained it could be handled through the WSU
               Office of Student Standards and Accountability or potentially
               through the Criminal Justice system. She said she wanted to
               keep things through the school and would allow me to enter her
               room. I read her Ferrier Warnings to her and she allowed me
               into her room. I asked why her room smelled like marijuana and
               she showed me two plastic containers that she said she keeps
               marijuana in when she has any. She said she has never smoked in
               her room or on campus, but did say she does smoke marijuana. I
               told her the contact would be forwarded to the WSU Office of
               Student Standards and accountability and asked her if she had
               any questions. She asked if anything was going to happen to her
               criminally. I told her I was not going to file any type of
               criminal charges on her, but warned her to make better
               decisions. I cleared. I certify and declare under penalty of

               UNIVERSITY POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W1226 SYNOPSIS: I was

               NARRATIVE: On 03-30-2014 at about 1716 hrs I was dispatched to
               a burglary alarm at the Dodgen Research Facility (NRC), located
               at 2480 NE Roundtop Drive. Officer Petlovany and I arrived on
               scene and determined that the exterior of the building was
               secure. The responsible party, identified as Christopher C.
               Hines (DOB 08-05-1982), arrived on scene and requested that we
               check the lower level. Officer Petlovany and I searched the
               lower level without incident, and Hines reset the alarm. Hines
               mentioned that during the last week, golf balls have been
               hitting the west side of the building. Hines said on one
               occasion, a golf ball hit the metal, roll-up door on the west
               side of the building. Officer Petlovany and I checked outside
               and observed three golf balls on the ground within the fenced
               enclosure located on the west side of the building. Hines
               advised that last Wednesday there was only one golf ball on the
               ground within the enclosure. Hines stated that the impact from
               the golf balls on the metal door could trigger the alarm. We
               also located another golf ball on the ground near the northwest
               corner of the building. Hines said he would check the video
               surveillance from the camera on the west side of the building.
               After reviewing the video surveillance footage, Hines will
               contact me tomorrow to advise if he observed any suspicious
               activity. Officer Petlovany and I cleared the scene and then
               contacted Todd Lupkes at the Palouse Ridge Golf Course. Lupkes
               is the general manager for the golf course. I explained the
               situation to Lupkes, and he checked the golf schedule. Lupkes
               determined that the patrons currently on the golf course would
               not have been in a position to hit a golf ball towards the NRC.
               Lupkes, Officer Petlovany, and I determined that someone could
               have been hitting golf balls towards the NRC if they were
               standing on the hillside located to the west of the NRC and
               just outside the boundaries of the golf coarse. I will request
               that officers conduct extra patrols in the area. Investigation
               continues. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the

               trespassing on the golf course. I responded and contacted Megan
               Sanchagrin who had originally reported the incident to her
               boss. She stated a small red car had pulled into the parking
               lot and two or three males had gotten out of the car and walked
               towards the golf course around the north side of the building.
               She stated they then walked back to the car and left. She
               called her boss as they were told to report anyone trespassing
               on the course after hours. She was not able to get a license
               plate of the vehicle and thought it might be a Honda or
               something similar. Ofc. Westerman and I checked the area and
               did not find any cars matching the description. We cleared. I

               playing basketball and has a laceration to his head. I
