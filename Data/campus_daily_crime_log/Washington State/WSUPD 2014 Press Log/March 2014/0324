               was dispatched to a two (2) vehicle non injury collision in a
               parking lot near Beasley Coliseum. I responded to the area. The
               collision occurred in the Yellow parking lot located off of
               North Fairway Lane. I contacted both drivers and the single
               passenger involved in the collision. None of the parties were
               injured and did not want any medical aid. Both vehicles were
               parked in legal parking spaces. Moe told me he was backing out
               of a parking space and struck a red car that was traveling past
               him. He said he did not see the vehicle as he was backing out
               of the parking space. The rear bumper on the passenger side of
               the truck had red paint on it. The bumper and the rear fender
               were dented. Altobelli told me she was traveling northeast
               toward the Indoor Practice Facility. She said the white truck
               backed out and struck her vehicle. Altobelli went on to tell me
               that this is the second accident in about a week she has been
               involved in. The driver's side rear passenger door was dented
               and had black paint on it. Both vehicles were able to drive
               away from the scene. The weather according to the National
               Weather Service Pullman Regional Airport reporting station at
               0853 hours was 41 degrees Fahrenheit. The straight flat
               blacktop roadway surface was dry at the time of the collision.
               Digital photographs and Vievu video were taken. No infractions
               were issued. Information was exchanged between drivers. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 24th day of March, 2014 in Pullman,

               person stuck in the Gannon Hall elevator. Upon arrival I found
               about 8 people standing around the elevator on the first floor.
               The people said they found the female stuck in the elevator.
               The elevator doors were cracked open about an inch. I could
               talk to the female, Alexis Marie Traina 05/18/95, through the
               crack. Alexis said she was doing ok and I told her the elevator
               technician was on his way. In the group was two RA's and I told
               them to call 911 if anything else happens. I cleared and
               returned back to Gannon Hall about 10 minutes later because
               Alexis said she was having a panic attack. I asked Alexis how
               she was doing and she said she was fine just hot. Once the Fire

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 03/24/14 at approximately 2109 hours,
               I was dispatched to a person stuck in the Gannon Hall elevator.
               Upon arrival I found about 8 people standing around the
               elevator on the first floor. The people said they found the
               female stuck in the elevator. The elevator doors were cracked
               open about an inch. I could talk to the female, Alexis Marie
               Traina 05/18/95, through the crack. Alexis said she was doing
               ok and I told her the elevator technician was on his way. In
               the group was two RA's and I told them to call 911 if anything
               else happens. I cleared and returned back to Gannon Hall about
               10 minutes later because Alexis said she was having a panic
               attack. I asked Alexis how she was doing and she said she was
               fine just hot. Once the Fire Department arrived they were able
               to open the elevator doors and free Alexis. Alexis said she was
               fine and did not need medical attention. About this time the
               elevator technician arrived. The elevator technician advised he
               did not need anything from me and I cleared. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and

               UNIVERSITY: University of Idaho NARRATIVE: On March 25, 2014 at
               approximately 0001 hours I was parked on Terre View on the
               northside of the street next to the Northwood Manor Apartments.
               I noticed a vehicle heading westbound on Terre View from my
               rear. I activated my rear in car radar (vehicle 38) and
               obtained a reading of 50 MPH. I watched the radar reading climb
               to 54 MPH before the vehicle passed my location. The section of
               Terre View that the vehicle was driving on is a 35 MPH zone. I
               pulled behind the vehicle and initiated a traffic stop at Terre
               View and Northwood Drive. I contacted the driver, Gabriel Angel
               Garcia 01/05/91, identified myself, informed the driver I was
               recording, and explained the reason for the stop. I asked for
               Garcia's driver's license, proof of insurance, and vehicle
               registration. As Garcia was looking for his documents I could
               smell the odor of intoxicants coming from the car. Garcia was
               the only person in the car. I asked Garcia how much he had to
               drink tonight and he said "a little bit." I asked how much a
               little bit was and Garcia said he had a few beers with some
               friends. I asked how many beers and Garcia said two. I asked
               Garcia if I could check his eyes and he stated yes. I preformed
               an HGN test on Garcia as he sat in the vehicle. I told Garcia
               to follow the tip of my finger with his eyes only and do not
               move his head. During the HGN test I observed equal pupil size,
               equal tracking, and lack of smooth pursuit. Garcia's eyes were
               bloodshot and watery. I told Garcia that I did not think he was
               being honest about how much he had to drink. Garcia stated he
               really had a few glasses of wine earlier. I asked Garcia if he
               was willing to do some voluntary standardized field sobriety
               tests. Garcia stated he would. I explained to Garcia that I
               would be evaluating him on how well he followed my instructions
               as well as how well he performed the tests. The first test I
               administered was the HGN test. I instructed Garcia to stand
               with his heels and toes together and keep his arms at his
               sides. I told Garcia to remain in that position while I
               administered the test. Garcia stated he understood. I told
               Garcia to follow the tip of my pen with his eyes only and not
               to move his head. I held my pen approximately 12-15 inches away

               from Garcia's head. During the test I observed, equal pupil
               size, equal tracking, and lack of smooth pursuit. While
               administering the test Garcia kept moving his head and would
               stop following the pen. I had to remind Garcia several times of
               the instructions The next test I administered was the walk and
               turn. I told Garcia to place his left foot on an imaginary line
               before him. I then instructed Garcia to place his right foot
               heel to toe in front of his left foot and keep his arms at his
               side. Garcia got into the starting position as instructed. I
               told Garcia to remain in that position as I gave further
               instructions. I told Garcia, when I tell you to begin, don't
               begin until I tell you, you will take a series of nine heel to
               toe steps down the line, with your arms at your side, looking
               down at your feet, and counting your steps out loud. Once you
               reach your ninth step leave your lead foot planted and with
               your rear foot take a series of small steps until you are
               facing where you came from and again take nine return heel to
               toe steps. I demonstrated the test for Garcia. I reminded
               Garcia to keep his arms at his side, count his steps out loud,
               look down at his feet, and do not stop the test until he had
               completed it. I asked Garcia if he understood and Garcia said
               he did. I told Garcia he could begin as soon as he was ready.
               Instruction Phase: No errors observed. First Nine Steps: Garcia
               stopped counting out loud after his third step. Garcia counted
               his first step as number 2. Garcia only took 8 steps and turned
               the wrong direction. Return Nine Steps: Garcia did not touch
               heel to toe on any of his return steps. The next test I
               administered was the One Leg Stand. I instructed Garcia to
               stand with his heels and toes together and keep his arms at his
               side. I told Garcia to remain in that position while I gave him
               further instructions. I told Garcia, when I tell you to begin,
               don't begin until I tell you, you will raise either leg of your
               choice and raise it six inches off the ground. You must point
               your toe so the sole of your shoe is parallel with the ground.
               While pointing your toe, keep your arms at your side, leg
               straight, look down at your foot and count out loud, one
               thousand one, one thousand two, one thousand three, and so on
               until I tell you to stop. If at any point you put your foot
               down, go ahead and pick it right back up and continue counting
               where ever you left off. I demonstrated the test and asked
               Garcia if he understood and he stated yes. I told Garcia to
               begin whenever he was ready. During the test Garcia kept
               looking up from his foot and was moving his arms around. Garcia
               counted to 18 in the 30 seconds. I told Garcia that the last
               test I had for him was the PBT. I explained what the PBT was,
               that it was voluntary, and it did not replace the evidentiary
               breath test. I found my PBT (Alco-Sensor FST #16805) in working
               condition. Garcia provided a PBT sample of .088. I told Garcia
               that he was under arrest for Negligent Driving in the 1st
               degree and handcuffed (D/L) him. I advised Garcia of his right
               to counsel and walked Garcia over to my patrol car where he was
               searched incident to arrest. Nothing of evidentiary value was
               found. I placed Garcia in the back seat of my patrol. With
               Garcia's permission, Ofc. Petlovany moved Garcia's car over to
               the bus turn around on North Fairway. The vehicle was locked

               and the keys were given back to Garcia. I transported Garcia to
               the Pullman Holding Facility where he was fingerprinted and
               photographed. Once completed, I issued Garcia Sector citation
               4Z0138559 for RCW 46.61.5249 Negligent Driving in the 1st
               Degree. I explained the citation to Garcia and provided him
               with his copy. Garcia was released from custody. My VieVu
               camera footage was uploaded to the department's computer.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 25th day of March, 2014, in
