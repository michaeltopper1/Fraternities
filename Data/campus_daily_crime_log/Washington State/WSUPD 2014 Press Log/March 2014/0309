               09-2014 at about 1119 hrs I was dispatched to a report of a
               malicious mischief in Streit Hall, located at 1620 NE Colorado
               Street. Dispatch advised that a window had been broken in the
               ground floor study lounge. I arrived on scene and contacted the
               complainant, Michael A. Hoodless (DOB 10-13-1987). Hoodless is
               the hall director for Streit Hall. Hoodless advised that
               someone had tipped over the pool table in the study lounge, and
               the edge of the pool table struck a large window pane along the
               south wall of the lounge. I observed that the window pane had
               been shattered and fragments of glass covered the ground. I
               also noticed that the impact from the pool table punched two
               holes into the metal window frame. The damage to the window is
               estimated to be $1000.00. The pool table was not damaged.
               Hoodless estimated that the damage occurred sometime between
               0100 hrs and 0900 hrs on 03-09-2014. I photographed the scene,
               and the photographs have been downloaded into Spillman.
               Hoodless advised that individuals turning over furniture in the
               study lounge has been an ongoing occurrence, but this was the
               first time anything had been damaged. Hoodless stated that he
               will be removing all the furniture in the lounge (including the
               pool table) because of the problems. Hoodless requested extra
               patrol from the police department in Streit Hall. WSU Housing
               Maintenance personnel arrived on scene and began cleaning up
               the broken glass and repairing the window. No suspects or leads
               were identified. No further action at this time. Olmstead/339 I

               The vehicle was registered to RGIS so I went to the Bookie

               possible theft on the 2nd floor of Community Duncan Dunn. Upon
               arrival I found the fire extinguisher box with the missing fire
               extinguisher next to room 212. The box was not damaged. I found
               the reporting party, William Connor Wolcott 01/29/94, on the
               first floor talking on his cell phone. I could overhear
               Wolcott's conversation and it sounded like Wolcott was being
               informed about where the fire extinguisher was. Once Wolcott
               got off the phone he informed me that the fire extinguisher was
               in the RED's office. Wolcott said the RED had taken the fire
               extinguisher away from some students last night and had stored
               the extinguisher in his office for safe keeping. I asked
               Wolcott what was their protocol for calling in incidents to the
               police. Wolcott said he is supposed to call the RED first then
               the RED call it in. I asked Wolcott if that was what he did and
               Wolcott said no. Wolcott said he called directly to Whitcom
               instead of running it through the RED. I asked Wolcott to run
               his incidents through the RED first in the future to prevent
               unnecessary called being created. No theft occurred. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 10th day of March, 2014, in Pullman,

               possible pepper spray deployment. I met with Manager Eddie
               Aguilar, who said the event had only taken place minutes before
               I arrived. I might have aquired a slight cough from being in

               people started coughing and vacated the facility. The possible
               deployment would have take place in the southern seating area.
               People were still eating within about 20 ft of the area. I
               found no canisters, fluids, or stains. The dining facility does
               not have any cameras. Aguilar had no witness or suspects. I
               educated him on the difference between pepper spray and its
               chemical counterparts. I advised him to clean all surfaces and
               to consult with EHS. While I met with Aguilar, Ofc. Westerman
               had checked the exterior of the building for anything

               03/10/14 at approximately 0027 hours, I was dispatched to a
               suspicious call at Stephenson North. As dispatch was relaying
               the information about the call I was waved down by the
               Reporting Party, RA Michael J. Imboden 09/04/94. Imboden said
               one of his residents, Levi Kaine Atkins 11/19/94, had stated
               someone was trying to get money out of him for his cell phone.
               Imboden said there were 3 males in the lobby of Stephenson who
               were wearing masks and waiting for Atkins. About this time
               Atkins arrived on scene. Atkins said he had texted his lost
               cell phone and someone replied for him to come to the lobby of
               Stephenson alone and with money. I told Atkins and Imboden to
               wait in the stairwell while I contacted the three. As described
               I found three males in the lobby of Stephenson wearing masks. I
               told all three to remove their masks which they did. All three
               were also wearing knit gloves. I asked the three what they were
               doing. One male said that they were returning a lost phone to
               someone and did not want him to think they had stolen it. The
               three males were identified as Gavin Christopher Statia
               05/17/95, Shawn Anthony Analla 08/03/95, and Ian Alexander Pope
               02/23/95. The three stated they had found the phone in a
               parking lot of Stephenson. They planned on turning in the cell
               phone to the front desk in the morning but the owner had texted
               his own phone. The three stated that the owner had told them he
               would give them $100 dollars if they returned the phone to him.
               The three stated they were not going to take the money. However
               they thought it would be a funny joke to wear masks. I asked
               the three if they had asked for money to return the cell phone.
               The three said no that Atkins had offered the money without
               them asking. I had Ofc. Petlovany stand with the three as I
               went back to talk to Atkins. I took the cell phone to Atkins
               and asked him to describe the phone. Atkins correctly described
               the phone and I handed it over to him. I asked Atkins to
               explain what happened. Atkins stated he had lost his cell phone
               and texted his number using his friend's phone. Atkins said he

               told the people he would give them $100 dollars to return his
               cell phone. I asked if I could see the text conversation.
               Atkins showed me his phone and allowed me to photograph the
               messages. The following is a transcript of the conversation:
               Atkins: "Please return this phone to the Stephenson Complex or
               call me before I have to report this phone as stolen. Please.
               I'll even pay you $100 for it. It'd be too expensive to replace
               otherwise and I like my phone :(" Reply: "Hey, your phone is
               safe, I was going to return it to the front desk in the morning
               but I can give it to you directly if you'd like." Atkins: "Sure
               man, that would be awesome. Thank you. When and where can I
               meet you?" Reply: "Stephenson lobby eh? 12:30 bring the money
               and come alone." Atkins: "I want to know you have the phone.
               Call me when you're there and talk to me until I get there.
               You're scaring me with the alone part." Reply: "Kay XD" I told
               Atkins that in the future that it was not a good idea to offer
               money for his items back. Instead to contact the police. Atkins
               said he understood. I went back to the three and explained how
               it is not a good idea to show up in masks for something like
               this. The three said they meant it as a joke. I explained that
               someone could be very frightened and concerned if they were
               confronted by three guys wearing masks. All three said they
               understood. I told them they were free to go and I cleared. No
               crimes were committed. Nothing further. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               10th day of March, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.
