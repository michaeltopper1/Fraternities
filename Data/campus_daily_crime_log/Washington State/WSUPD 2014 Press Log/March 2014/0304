               contacted Le in the lobby. She told me that she was at the bus
               stop on Spokane St in front of Honors Hall waiting for the bus.
               She said she had her backpack and her laptop that she was

               later that she left her laptop at the bus stop. She told me
               that she rode the bus back around to that stop and her computer
               was gone. Le described her computer as a white VAIO 16" laptop

               was dispatched to a report of the odor of marijuana coming from
               room 339 of Streit Hall. Upon my arrival Ofc Kirshner, who was
               in the area on another call, and I made our way to the 4th
               floor. As entered the entryway for the floor we both
               immediately noticed the heavy odor of burnt marijuana coming
               from the doorway leading onto the floor. We entered the floor
               and upon finding room 339 I smelled the crack around the
               doorway and noticed the odor of marijuana coming from within
               the room along with an air freshner which appeared to have been
               sprayed as well. Kirshner and I knocked on the door and after a
               short period of time the door was answered by a female, later
               identified as Madison L Meeker (080495). As Meeker opened the
               door both Kirshner and I noticed the odor of marijuana coming
               from within the room. We explained why we were contacting her
               and as she began to respond I noticed her pupils appeared to be
               abnormally large given the lighting conditions and time of day.
               In addition I also noticed a cardboard tube approximately 24
               inches in length with a fabric softener sheet tied around one
               end. Based upon my training and experience I recognized this as
               an indicator of someone having smoked marijuana. We asked
               Meeker if she knew why we were contacting her and she began to
               start breathing heavily before admitting to having smoked
               marijuana in her room. Kirshner asked her if we could come in
               and speak with her and advised her of her Ferrier Warnings. She
               told us we could come in and once in the room she pulled out a
               metal tin which contained a small amount of what appeared to be
               marijuana along with two rolled joints. At this point we spoke
               with her about the legal issues related to smoking marijuana
               after which she told us she told us she would destroy the
               remaining marijuana. I escorted her to the bathroom where the
               remaining marijuana was destroyed and flushed down the toilet
               before we returned to her room. Upon returning to her room I
               told her I would be forwarding this case to student conduct and
               after answering the remainder of her questions cleared. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under

               harassment which involved one of her students from the third
               floor of Perham Hall. Johnson is the Resident Advisor for the
               third floor of Perham Hall. Johnson stated Shannon Elliott
               lived in 339 Perham Hall until 02-26-14. On 02-26-14 Elliott
               was moved to 333 Streit Hall on 02-26-14. Johnson said she had
               "Heard through the grapevine" Elliot was being harassed by
               other women on the third floor of Perham Hall and believed it
               was because she is a lesbian. She said she herd some of the
               women mumble things to Elliott, but could not remember or tell
               us anything that was actually said. She did say some of the
               women on the floor were accusing Elliott of showering with her
               girlfriend in the Perham Hall third floor bathroom. People are
               not allowed to shower together in Residence Halls on the
               Washington State University Campus. Johnson told me she was
               supposed to report the issue to law enforcement two weeks ago,
               but forgot. The RED for Streit/Perham Halls, Michael Hoodless,
               came into the office where I was speaking with Johnson and
               informed me Elliott's mother had been calling his office very
               upset about what was going on with his daughter and said she
               also mentioned being afraid for her daughter's safety. I told
               him I would contact Elliott and see if she wanted me to also
               speak with her daughter. I called Elliott and asked if she
               would like to speak with me regarding the harassment she had
               received while she lived on the third floor of Perham Hall. She
               said she was willing to speak with me, but knew no crime had
               been committed. She said she did not report the incidents to
               the Police because no crime had been committed and nothing had
               happened since she had been moved on 02-26-14. I asked her to
               tell me what had happened. Elliott told me she is a lesbian and
               has a girlfriend at WSU. She said she and her girlfriend spent
               a lot of time together when she lived on the third floor of

               Perham Hall. She said she doesn't know any of the other girls
               who lived on the third floor of Perham Hall because she keeps
               to herself and spends a lot of time with her girl friend. She
               said she does not believe the other girls on her floor approved
               of her lifestyle. She said she believes this because some of
               them would yell insults at them like "Bitch and Whore" while
               they walked down the hallway. She said people had accused
               Elliott's girlfriend of showering with her in the same shower
               stall on the floor as well as living with Elliott in the Hall.
               Elliott said they would shower at the same time and use the
               same soap, but using different stalls and said her girlfriend
               did spend a lot of time in her room, but has her own apartment
               in Pullman. Elliott said the last straw was in the early
               morning hours of 02-23-14, when there was a suspicious fire on
               the third floor of Perham Hall. When the fire alarm had sounded
               and the residents were evacuating the Hall, an unknown female
               yelled something to the effect of "The lesbians must have done
               it". Elliott went to hall staff and asked to be moved. Elliott
               said since being moved to the third floor of Streit Hall she
               has not been being harassed. She said her girlfriend doesn't
               like to come to the hall and just prefers to hang out at her
               apartment because of how she and Elliott were treated in Perham
               Hall. Elliott said she was never threatened and never felt fear
               of any sort. She merely wanted people to keep their comments to
               their selves. I advised Elliott to call us if this type of
               behavior happened to her or her girlfriend again and told her
               about the WSU Office for Equal Opportunity as a resource.
               Elliott asked me to call her mother, Dawn M. Elliott (08-09-73)
               to speak with her. I spoke with Dawn and by the end of our
               conversation she felt better. Since there was no threats or
               fear, by Elliott or her girlfriend, of threats, the crime of
               harassment is unfounded. This case was sent to the Washington
               State University Office for Equal Opportunity by J.
               Kirshner/333 on 03-04-14. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               4th day of March, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               and I were dispatched to an injured person on the north side of
               Johnson Tower. The r/p was stating that someone had threw a
               glass Coke bottle at them. The r/p stated that the suspects
               were approximately 10 college age males and females that were
               currently running south on Troy. I responded to the r/p's
               location while Welter went to look for the suspects. When I
               arrived on scene I contacted the two victims, Bonnie Van Allen
               and April Dodd. Van Allen stated that she and Dodd were
               standing next to the north door of Johnson Tower when they saw
               approximately 10 college age males and females. The 10 were at
               the top of the north sky bridge to the tower. They were talking
               loudly and kicking a traffic cone around. One of the males
               noticed the two standing by the building. He said something
               about the two then he threw the glass bottle at them. The
               bottle flew through the air then struck the wall closest to
               Dodd. The two said glass blew everywhere. Both were hit, but
               Dodd was struck hard on the left side of her head. I asked her
               is she needed an ambulance and she said "No, I think I am
               fine." I asked if I could look at her head. She said I could. I
               saw a slight redness on her scalp, but no scratches. As I
               looked at her I noticed there were glass shard's in the hood of
               her sweatshirt. I again asked if she needed medical assistance
               and she said she was fine. I asked the two if they thought the
               10 knew they were next to the building. Van Allen said that the
               male that threw the bottle said something like "Watch
               this(threw the bottle) Wholly crap I almost got them." I asked
               the two if they could describe the 10. Van Allen said all
               wearing dark clothing except one female who was wearing a light
               color hoodie sweatshirt and dark pants. I photographed the
               glass and later downloaded the photos onto the departmental
               hard drive. There didn't appear to be any damage to the
               building. I told the two that I would going to go look for the
               10. I told them if they saw then again to call 911. I also told
               Dodd that if she started feeling bad to call 911 and request an
