    Narrative: RVWD: Asst. Chief: OFC: JAK/333 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY
               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W1066 SYNOPSIS: A non-disclosed
               person called stating she had learned from the Washington State
               Division of Child Support enforcement, a male student, who
               attends Washington State University, had a suspended Washington
               State Driver's License and has been driving in the Moscow,

               14, Jennifer L. Ellis (07-30-79) called Whitcom wanting to
               report a traffic offense. I called Ellis and asked her what I
               could do for her. She said Jason K. Harmon (05-06-86) is a
               student at Washington State University. She said Harmon has
               been driving in the Moscow, Idaho and Pullman, Washington areas
               even though his Driver's License is suspended. She said she
               received verification Harmon's License is suspended from the
               Washington State Division of Child Support Enforcement on 03-
               18-14. This sounded odd to me; however, Whitcom was able to
               check Harmon's driving status and verified he is suspended in
               the 3rd degree through. Ellis and Harmon have a 12 year old
               daughter in common. She does not have any specific dates,
               locations, or times of when Harmon had driven in the Moscow and
               Pullman areas. She said she had received some of her
               information from Harmon's ex-wife. Ellis said she would be
               speaking with Harmon's ex-wife to attempt to gather more
               information and was going to send me an e-mail. More to follow.
               I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws
               of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 19th day of March, 2014, in Pullman,

               14, at approximately 1711 hours, I responded to the WSU Compton
               Union Building and contacted Hanna Congur at the information
               desk. Congur handed me a dark colored notebook and said it had
               been turned in to her by a female who works in the bookie. She
               did not get the name of the female who turned it in to her, not
               did she ask when and where the notebook was found. She said she
               believed she would recognize the female if she saw her again. I
               gave her my business card with the case number written on it
               and asked her to give the card to the female who turned in the
               notebook if she saw her again. The notebook is made by ASUS and
               has the serial number C90XAS087773 taped onto the back side of
               the notebook. The notebook was in a black case. The notebook
               has a "Lock" on it so I cannot access it to see if I can
               determine who owns it. I have locked the notebook in a
               temporary evidence locker at the WSU Police Department in hopes
               I can determine who it belongs to and have it returned to it's
               owner. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the

               coming from room 211. I walked over to room 211 and knocked on
               the door. Alexander J. Schumacker 09/30/94 answered the door.
               When Schumacker opened his door I could smell the slight odor
               of marijuana and heavy masking agents. I told Schumacker that I
               was at his room because of the odor of marijuana. Schumacker

               going to get a vacuum in the morning to vacuum up the small
               amounts of marijuana out of the carpet. I told Schumacker that

               fact he would be referred to student conduct. Throughout the
