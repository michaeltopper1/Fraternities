               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 03-03-2014 at about 0847 hrs I was
               dispatched to an agency assist for the Yuma Police Department
               in Arizona. I contacted Detective Rodrigo Bacaneri on the
               telephone, 928-373-4694. Detective Bacaneri told me that he was
               investigating a child molestation case that occurred in
               Arizona. The suspect in the case was identified as Ellec J.
               Roy(DOB 07-11-1995). Roy is a Washington State University
               student and resides at Stephenson North #923. Detective
               Bacaneri explained that Roy's nine year old cousin, identified
               as Isabella M. McNeil (DOB 09-02-2004), had reported to her
               mother that Roy had touched her vagina. Detective Bacaneri
               requested that I contact and interview Roy about the incident,
               and depending on the outcome of the interview, determine if Roy
               would take a polygraph examination. Detective Bacaneri provided
               me with a copy of his police report. I reviewed the report and
               learned the following: The incident occurred sometime around
               the summer of 2012 in the afternoon. McNeil was asleep on the
               bed in a bedroom of a relative's house. McNeil woke up and
               discovered that Roy was lying behind her on the bed. Roy's hand
               was under her pants, but over her underwear, and was touching
               her vagina. McNeil starting crying, and Roy told her not to
               tell anyone because she would get into trouble and he would not
               be her cousin anymore. McNeil told Roy to stop, and she left
               the room. McNeil reported that Roy had an injured arm at the
               time. Detective Bacaneri's report has been added to the case
               file. Investigation continues. Olmstead/339 I certify and

               n/a NARRATIVE: On 03-03-2014 at about 1338 hrs I was dispatched
               to a report of a non-injury vehicle collision that occurred in
               the Bustad Hall parking lot, located at 1845 NE Grimes Way. The
               collision occurred earlier that same day about 1315 hrs. I
               contacted all of the parties involved on the telephone and
               determined the following: Jingting Liu (DOB 08-19-1993) was the
               driver of a gray, 2010 Mercedes Benz 4-door sedan (WA Lic.
               AON3180). Janet C. Johnson (DOB 12-30-1953) was the driver of a
               red, 1998 Ford Expedition (WA Lic. WSU9513). No other
               passengers or witnesses were identified. Johnson was travelling
               through the Bustad Hall parking lot and stopped her vehicle
               momentarily in the parking lot lane of travel. Liu was backing
               up out of a parking space and did not see Johnson's vehicle
               behind her. The rear bumper of Liu's vehicle collided with the
               front tire of Johnson's vehicle. None of the involved
               individuals complained of any injuries. I gave Liu a verbal
               warning for unsafe backing. I encouraged all the involved
               individuals to report vehicle collisions at the time they
               occur, so that a police officer can respond and accurately
               document the incident. No further action at this time.
               Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under penalty of perjury

               4, 2014 at approximately 0212 hours I heard Ofc. Harris of the
               Pullman Police Department call out with a foot pursuit in the
               area of Chief Joseph. Harris had attempted a traffic stop on a
               vehicle. The vehicle pulled into the Chief Joseph apartment
               parking lot and a male jumped out of the car and fled on foot.
               Ofc. Harris chased the male on foot around the C building of
               Chief Joseph. The male ran toward the entrance of the C
               building and was able to get into a unit before Ofc. Harris
               could apprehend him. Ofc. Harris said he heard the male enter
               the building but did not see what unit. Ofc. Harris found blood
               on the door to unit C2. The car that the suspect ran from was a
               rental car from enterprise rental. It was determined the car
               was rented to a female Shaquelle M Duncan 08/07/93 who lives in
               C2. Duncan was contacted and she said she lent the car to a
               friend. It was determined that Duncan's ex-boyfriend was
               driving the rental car, Shaun L Fuhr 03/25/96. Fuhr has 2
               active warrants for his arrest, One out of Whitman County and
               one out of King County. Also Fuhr is suspended through
               Washington. Also inside unit C2 was Jason John Fuhr-Turner
               05/25/93.While Ofc. Harris was writing a search warrant for
               unit C2 I heard a noise coming from the front of the building.
               I went around the corner and saw the screen punched out and two
               males walking away from the building. One male I recognized as
               Jason J. Fuhr-Turner who had just walked out of the apartment.
               The second male matched the description of the male that ran
               from Ofc. Harris. I told the two to stop and both started
               running. The second male (Fuhr) ran up a stairwell and was
               hiding next to the laundry area. Jason Fuhr-Turner kept going
               down the sidewalk towards the E building. I told Fuhr to stop
               and he hopped over a railing to get away. Fuhr ran up a muddy
               embankment and slipped. I grabbed Fuhr by the pant leg and
               struggled with him for a moment. Fuhr yelled for me to let him
               go as we rolled on the ground. Fuhr was able to wiggle out of
               his pants, both shoes, and one black sock and get up the hill.
               Once I was able to get up the hill, Fuhr ran down the sidewalk

               and slipped and fell down. Fuhr got back up and I ran after
               him. Fuhr ran into the entrance of the E building and started
               frantically banging on the door saying "let me in." By the time
               I reached the font of the E building Fuhr had already made it
               inside. I followed the muddy foot prints that led into E2.
               There was mud on the ground in front of E2 and mud smeared on
               the door itself. There is also a muddy footprint that leads
               right into E2. There is no other mud leading to any other units
               in the E building. WSU Police Officers were able to surround
               the building and nobody has come out of E2. I returned to my
               patrol car and looked up a photograph of Fuhr. The photograph
               of Fuhr matched the person who ran from me and I struggled
               with. It is clear that Fuhr is inside E2 of the Chief Joseph
               Apartments. We knocked on the door of E2 and no one answered.
               Cpl. Daniels was able to see two black males in the apartment.
               One had on a white tshirt which is what Fuhr had been wearing.
               We also attempted to call inside the apartment and the
               residents called did not answer their phones. A search warrant
               for E2 was issued by Judge Robinson. Whitman County Regional
               SWAT team served the search warrant and 6 people were detained.
               One of the individuals found inside of E2 was Shawn L Fuhr.
               Fuhr was arrested. When Fuhr was searched incident to arrest,
               Fuhr had the keys to the rental car in his pocket. The keys in
               Fuhr's pocket locked and unlocked the rental car that was in
               the parking lot. Fuhr was interview after mirandized and Fuhr
               admitted to running from both Ofc. Harris and I. Fuhr stated he
               was scared and that was why he ran. Fuhr did state he knew I
               was a Police Officer when I told him to stop. ***More to
