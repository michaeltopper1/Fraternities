               NARRATIVE: On 03/05/14 at approximately 1000 hours I was
               dispatched to a welfare check at 1401 NE Merman Dr. C311. The
               reporting party, Saeid (Sam) Ghannad, said that he was
               contacted by family members who were concerned that Amirhossein
               Arasteh was suicidal. The call takers comments said that
               Arasteh showed his mom a knife and said he was going to commit
               suicide in the next three days. The comments also stated that a
               friend of Arasteh (Ali Azadfar) took Arasteh to the hospital
               last night. I called Azadfar and asked him to tell me what
               happened. Azadfar said he was contacted by Sam and was asked to
               check on Arasteh and take him to the hospital because of his
               suicidal comments. I asked Azadfar if he did take Arasteh to
               the hospital and he said he did. Azadfar said he waited at the
               hospital while he saw the doctor and then drove him back home.
               Azadfar said when he dropped off Arasteh at home that Arasteh
               told he he was fine and that Azadfar could leave, which he did.
               I attempted to call Sam twice, but he did not answer so I left
               him two messages. Ofc. Stewart and I responded to Arasteh's
               residence (Terrace Apts C311). I knocked on the door several
               times, but there was no answer. I knocked on Arasteh's
               neighbor's door and it was answered by a female. I asked her if
               she had a neighbor and she said she did. I asked her what his
               name was and she said Amir. I asked her if she saw Amir
               recently and she said she saw him the day before. The neighbor
               said she wanted to talk to us about Amir and at this point
               Arasteh opened his door. I asked Arasteh if he had a moment to
               talk and he said he did. I asked if we could come in and he
               said we could. We walked into the kitchen/dining area. I
               immediately saw a Swiss Army knife on a table on top of some
               papers. I had Arasteh sit on a bed that was in the room. I
               asked him if he knew why we were there and he said no. I looked
               down at the papers and saw the words "I want to Live" written
               over and over on a page. I also noticed the word "I want to
               kill" written on the paper. I pointed at the paper and told him
               that was what we were there to talk about. Arasteh said, "My
               homework?" I told Arasteh I was interested in what was written
               on the homework. I asked Arasteh if he sent a picture of the
               knife to anyone and he said no. I asked Arasteh if he made

               suicidal threats to anyone and he said no. Arasteh asked who
               called. I told Arasteh that concerned family members called
               after he made suicidal comments. I asked Arasteh if he wanted
               to hurt himself and he said no and got up. Arasteh asked if
               that was all we needed (as if he felt we were going to leave).
               I told him that I wanted to talk with him a little more. I
               looked back at the papers and noticed another page under the
               top one that had the words "I want to die" written all over it.
               I told Arasteh I was concerned about him and asked if he has
               seen a counselor recently and he said he did last night. I
               asked Arasteh if he planned to see a counselor again soon and
               he said yes. I asked Arasteh if he would be willing to let me
               take him to the hospital. Arasteh said that would be fine. I
               had Arasteh gather his belongings. While Arasteh gathered his
               items I collected the knife for safekeeping and the notes to
               give to the mental health professional. Ofc. Stewart checked
               Arasteh kitchen and only located a very dull knife, which he
               left. While en route to the hospital Arasteh commented that we
               passed counseling services. I told Arasteh we could go there
               and turned around and took him to counseling services. I stood
               aside while Arasteh spoke with the receptionist. I provided
               Arasteh with my business card and Whitcom's phone number. I
               told Arasteh to call Whitcom if he needed me to give him a ride
               home. Arasteh said he would be fine. I went back and spoke with
               Dr. Rodriguez (the mental health professional). I told Dr.
               Rodriguez what I discovered and provided him the notes I
               gathered. While I handed the papers to Dr. Rodriguez I noticed
               on the back of one of the pages the words "I want to kill
               myself" were written all over the paper. I provided Dr.
               Rodriguez with my business card and case number and told him to
               call if I could be of any further assistance. I called Sam and
               spoke with him about the situation. Sam told me that Arasteh
               had used "facetime" and spoke with his mother in Iran the night
               before. Sam said Arasteh showed his mom the knife and said he
               was going to kill himself in the next three days. I told Sam
               that I took Arasteh to counseling services and dropped him off.
               Sam said he was en route to Pullman from Bellingham to
               hopefully have Arasteh withdraw from school and hopefully get
               him to a treatment facility. At approximately 1645 hours Sam
               arrived at the WSUPD. I explained to Sam that I did not know
               what happened after I dropped Arasteh off and that counseling
               services would probably not release any information. I was busy
               with another case so I had Asst. Chief Hansen and Records
               Manager McNannay further assist him. During my contact with
               Arasteh he was very "stand offish" and would only give me short
               answers. He did not want to engage in conversation with me. On
               03/06/14 at approximately 0830 hours I met with Sam at WSUPD.
               Sam explained that Arasteh was out in his car and he was taking
               steps to get Arasteh to withdraw. Sam explained that he is
               going to get Arasteh connected with family either in California
               or would take him back to Bellingham to ensure he continues to
               get help. Sam said he would contact our department if he needed
               any further assistance. I returned the Swiss Army knife to Sam.
               I sent a copy of the case to counseling services. I certify and
