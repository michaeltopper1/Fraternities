               Hall. Ofc Petlovany and Ofc Kirshner also responded and upon
               our arrival we went to the 11th floor. As we entered the
               hallway of the 11th floor I immediately noticed the odor of
               burnt marijuana hanging in the air. As we reached room 1129 I
               smelled around the door jam and noticed what I recognized as
               the odor of burnt marijuana coming from inside the room. I
               knocked on the door, which was answered by Rosa M Cardenas
               (060595, and as the door opened I confirmed the odor of burnt
               marijuana was coming from within the room. Ofc Petlovany asked
               Cardenas and the second female, later identified as Rebekah E
               Kraut (052695), to step outside into the hallway so we could
               speak with them. Once outside I explained why we were
               contacting them. Cardenas admitted to having smoked a blunt in
               her room and Kraut also admitted to having smoked marijuana in
               the room as well. Cardenas explained that they had smoked all
               of the marijuana they had and I asked to see their
               identification, which they provided. We spoke for a short time
               longer before we warned them of their behavior and cleared.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury

               at approximately 1904 hours I was driving vehicle 17 eastbound
               on NE Colorado St near D St when I observed a vehicle driving
               westbound (WA/AHG7994) exceeding the posted speed limit of 20
               mph. My radar verified the vehicle was moving at 31 mph. My
               radar's calibration was verified before and after the stop. I
               turned around and saw the vehicle turn down D St without
               signaling to do so. I turned down D St and saw the vehicle turn
               on to Shaw St without signaling. It appeared the vehicle was
               trying to hide from me. I activated my emergency lights and the
               vehicle stopped shortly after at Lake St, near Scott-Coman
               Hall. I approached the driver, later identified as Jacob D.
               Eggers (11994), and told him I was recording. I could smell the
               odor of marijuana coming from the vehicle. Eggers surmised I
               had stopped him for speeding. Eggers had 3 passengers: Justin
               A. Santillan (111994), Oscar J. Fuentes (020695), Zachary F.
               Griffith (071694). The front passenger Fuentes opened the glove
               box to retrieve the registration and I smelled a renewed odor
               of marijuana. I had Eggers exit the vehicle and explain to me
               why I could smell the odor of marijuana. He denied being a
               medicinal marijuana patient. He said he had allowed other
               friends not present to smoke in his car earlier in the day. He
               said he was unsure of what was in the car. However, when I
               asked him to get out of the car, he appeared to give a
               cautionary look to his rear passenger and I would later find
               marijuana in the glove box where he assisted Fuentes in getting
               the registration. I had Eggers sit on the curb. I then
               approached the passenger side of the vehicle and could smell
               the odor from that side as well. I had Santillan speak with me
               outside of the vehicle. He said he had just gotten picked up at
               his residence hall. He sat on the curb. Ofc. Welter arrived as
               backup. I had Fuentes speak with me outside of the vehicle. He
               commented he knew me from a previous case but I have no
               recollection of it, nor is there anything relevant in Spillman.
               He said he had quit smoking marijuana recently after getting
               caught. I then spoke with Griffith, who disclosed he thought
               Egger was trying to hide from me. He denied smoking marijuana

               that day. I spoke with Eggers again and explained to him I
               could smell the odor coming from his car and that I would like
               to look through his vehicle. He asked what would happen if he
               did not give permission and I told him I could not tell him as
               it could be considered coercive. I explained he could restrict
               where I looked, rescind his permission, and deny me any access.
               He said he was not sure what was in his car and I asked him
               about a brown paper bag under the front passenger seat. He was
               not sure. I told him he could retrieve it and decide if he
               wanted to give me permission. He looked in the bag and it was a
               bong. I told him that it was not illegal to possess a bong. The
               3 passengers were free to go once Eggers confirmed they had
               nothing in the vehicle. Eggers granted permission and I had
               Ofc. Welter stand with him in case he changed his mind, he
               asked I be quick. I found a purple plastic container in the
               glove box that contained a green vegetable material (GVM) that
               was seized. There was a plastic bag with various legal drug
               paraphernalia. In the center console was a glass jar with GVM
               that was seized. There was more legal drug paraphernalia there
               as well. There was GVM shake under the seats. I told Eggers I
               would like the names of the people he believed to be the
               alleged owners of the marijuana. I gave him time to think about
               it. I got his phone for him in case he wanted to call them. He
               decided he did not want to and he would claim the marijuana. I
               informed him he was under arrest for possession of marijuana
               less than 40 grams and informed him of his right to an
               attorney. I then read him his Miranda rights. I had him wait
               for me in his car as it began to hail. I completed Sector
               Citation #4Z0321322 and issued it to Eggers. He was released
               and I cleared. The gvm was later weighed and placed into
               evidence. The gvm in the purple container weighed 4.15 grams
               and the gvm in the glass jar weighed 21.05 grams. Both
               specimens were weighed without the containers. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               25th day of March, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               occupied vehicle at the lower loading dock. I contacted Rebecca
               E. Birchett (111094) and Reid O. McPherson (052395). They said
               they were just simply hanging out and were not aware of the
               facility. I did not detect any drugs or alcohol. I was able to
               see in their vehicle (WA/AND1724) and did not see anything
               suspicious. I informed them they could not park there. They
               left. I completed checking the facility and later emailed Corey
               Hines regarding the access to the loading dock. Nothing
               follows. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 26th day of March, 2014, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer

               NARRATIVE: On 03/25/14 at approximately 2354 hours I was
               driving westbound on Colorado near the Scott Coman parking lot.
               The sidewalk on the northside of the street is fenced off due
               to construction in the Scott Coman parking lot. The fence
               protruded into the street causing there to be no usable
               sidewalk on the northside of the street. There are several
               signs that instruct pedestrians to cross the street to the
               southside of the street so they may use the sidewalk. When I
               was driving westbound on Colorado there was a large SUV in
               front of me. When we reached the area of the fenced off Scott
               Coman parking lot, the SUV abruptly swerved away from the fence
               causing the SUV to cross into the oncoming traffic lane. When
               the SUV swerved I saw a male walking in the street along the
               fence line. I turned off my emergency lights and exited my car.
               I asked the male, later identified as Cole Ashton Bonvallet
               03/02/95, what he was doing. Bonvallet said he was walking to
               his dorm. I asked why he was walking in the roadway and he said
               he was walking on the side of the road. I asked Bonvallet if he
               saw all the signs telling him to cross the street and use the
               sidewalk. Bonvallet said he did not. I had Bonvallet walk with
               me over to the sidewalk so were were not standing in the
               roadway. Once on the sidewalk I asked for Bonvallet's info.
               Bonvallet provided his WSU cougar card and verbally provided
               his date of birth, 03/02/95. Bonvallet identified himself as 19
               years old. As Bonvallet spoke I could clearly smell the odor of
               intoxicants coming from his breath. I asked Bonvallet how much
               he had to drink. Bonvallet said he had not drank anything. I
               asked Bonvallet why I would be smelling alcohol coming from him
               then. Bonvallet said he was at a fraternity where people were
               drinking but he was not drinking. I asked Bonvallet if I could
               check his eyes. Bonvallet said I could and I performed an HGN
               test on Bonvallet. During the test I noticed, equal tracking,
               lack of smooth pursuit, and distinct and sustained nystagmus at
               maximum deviation. Bonvallet was swaying side to side as he
               stood before me. I told Bonvallet that I knew he had been
               drinking. I again asked Bonvallet how much he had to drink.
               Bonvallet said he had a few beers. I asked how much a few beers

               was. Bonvallet said two. I asked Bonvallet if he was willing to
               provide a PBT sample and he said no. I told Bonvallet that he
               was under arrest for MIP and handcuffed (D/L) him. I advised
               Bonvallet of his right to counsel. Bonvallet was searched
               incident to arrest and no weapons or items of evidentiary value
               were found. I placed Bonvallet in the backseat of my patrol car
               while I researched his prior contacts. Bonvallet has not been
               arrested or contacted by the Police before. I drove Bonvallet
               over to his dorm, Coman Hall, and told him I would be
               forwarding charges of MIP Exhibiting to the prosecutor. I
               explained the process as well as Student Conduct's process.
               Bonvallet was released from custody and I cleared. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 26th day of March, 2014, in Pullman,
