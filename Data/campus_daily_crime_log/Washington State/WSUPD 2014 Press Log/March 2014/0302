               toned out to a burglary alarm at the WSU Student Recreation
               Center (SRC). Officer Olmstead and I responded to the building.
               We found a front door unlocked at the closed business. I asked
               Whitom to call inside. They did, but there was no answer.
               Officer Olmstead and I made entry into the building announcing
               our presence. We contacted a female SRC employee inside the
               building. She said she had disarmed the alarm and did not know
               why it had activated. She said she had been working in the
               building preparing for the morning opening. She had unlocked
               the front door for staff to enter. We checked the back loading
               dock entry. Nothing was found. Unknown why the alarm activated.
               No further investigation. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 2nd day of March,

               03/02/14 at approximately 2301 hours I responded to Community
               Duncan Dunn where an assault had just occurred. Dispatch stated
               that the reporting party, Bryawna S. Yager 08/21/95, had just
               been pushed by another female in the door. Dispatch stated both
               parties were separated. Upon arrival I contacted Yager who was
               in her room, 137. Yager invited me inside her room to talk.
               Also inside Yager's room was Alexis Marie Jones 10/04/94 who
               said she had witnessed the incident. I asked Yager what
               happened. Yager said that over the weekend she had given her
               cougar card to Jones so she could feed her fish while she went
               back to Tacoma for the weekend. Yager said she thought that her
               next door neighbor, Rachel Kathleen Swanson 06/16/95, had
               stolen some of her clothing. About this time Cpl. Daniels
               arrive on scene and spoke with Swanson who was in her RA's
               room. Jones said over the weekend she decided to do Yager's
               laundry for her as a way to thank Yager for letting her borrow
               some of Yager's clothes. When Jones when to collect the clothes
               out of the dryer she found the clothes to be moved out of the
               dryer and onto a folding table. Jones said this is common and
               she was not alarmed by it. However Jones noticed a jeans jacket
               missing from the clothes she had just washed. Jones said she
               looked at the other loads of laundry and noticed a load that
               had what she believed to be the jeans jacket. Jones said she
               recognized the load of laundry to belong to Swanson. Yager
               stated when she returned from Tacoma, Jones told her what
               happened. Yager went to Swanson's room to confront Swanson
               about the clothing. Yager stated that she asked Swanson to look
               through her closet for her jacket and other clothing that had
               come up missing. Jones told Yager that she could not look
               through her stuff. Yager said that she asked Swanson several
               different ways to look through Swanson's clothes for her
               missing items but Swanson would not let her. Yager said during
               this encounter she was sanding in the door frame to Swanson's
               room. Yager demonstrated for me how she was standing. Yager was
               leaning against the latch side of the door frame with one foot

               inside Swanson's room. Yager said Swanson got upset with Yager
               and pushed her out of the room. I asked Yager to describe how
               she was pushed. Yager said that Swanson put her hand on Yager's
               stomach, grabbed a handful of shirt and skin and pushed Yager
               into the hallway causing Yager to hit the wall on the opposite
               side of the hallway. I asked Yager if it hurt and she said it
               did. Yager said that when Yager grabbed her her skin on her
               stomach was grabbed too. Yager also stated that it hurt when
               her back hit the wall of the hallway. I asked Yager if she was
               comfortable with showing me her stomach and Yager said that was
               fine. Yager lifted her shirt and I noticed the area between her
               bra and bellybutton was red but I was unable to see distinct
               finger or scratch marks. The skin was red in general. I asked
               if I could photograph her stomach and Yager said I could. I
               asked Yager if she had any marks on her back from hitting the
               wall and she said she did not know. I looked at Yager's back
               and saw no red marks. The photograph was later uploaded to the
               department's computer. Jones said what she saw was consistent
               with what Yager had said. I spoke briefly with Cpl. Daniels who
               stated Swanson had told Yager to leave her room several times
               and when Yager did not she pushed Yager out of her room. I
               spoke with Swanson who was still in the RA's room. I asked
               Swanson what happened. Swanson said she was in her room with
               two friends when Swanson knocked on her door. One of Swanson's
               friends opened the door and Yager began to ask to look through
               Swanson's closet. About this time Swanson's two friends left.
               Swanson told Yager that she could not look at her stuff.
               Swanson stated she told Yager that she needed to leave her room
               several times but Yager did not. Swanson said she "lightly
               pushed" Yager out of the way. I asked Swanson to describe how
               she pushed Yager. Swanson said she put her hand on Yager's
               stomach and "pushed until she (Yager) moved." I asked Swanson
               how far she pushed Yager into the hallway. Swanson said she
               pushed Yager just enough so she could shut her door. I asked
               Swanson if Yager ever hit the wall on the other side of the
               hallway. Swanson said Yager did not. I asked Swanson how her
               hand was when she pushed Yager. Swanson said her hand was open
               the whole time and she did not grab Yager. I asked Swanson why
               she thought Yager would believe that she took some of her
               clothing. Swanson said she had no idea. Swanson said she was
               more than willing to allow me to look through her stuff to
               prove she did not have Yager's clothing. I asked Swanson if she
               wanted to press charges on Yager for not leaving her room.
               Swanson said she did not. I went back to Yager and asked her a
               few follow up questions. I told Yager that because she was
               saying that she was assaulted by Swanson I wanted to be very
               clear about the events. I asked Yager if she was pushed
               completely across the hallway and into the wall. Yager changed
               her answer and said she was pushed which caused her to take
               several steps back and her arm and elbow hit the wall. This
               statement was much different than Yager had first described.
               Yager also said Swanson never told her to leave the room
               instead pushed her out of the room. I told Yager that there
               seemed to be fault on both parties and there would no be any
               arrests in this case. I explained how student conduct and hall

               staff would become involved in this situation instead of
               courts. I advised Yager to stay clear of Swanson so no other
               incident occurred. I asked Yager to describe the clothing she
               was missing so I could check Swanson's room for it. Yager said
               she was missing an Abercrombie and Fitch jeans vest and an
               American Eagle light pink sweater with lace on the back. I
               provided Yager with my business card and her case number. I
               told Yager to contact me if there were additional incidents
               between Swanson and her. During my contact with Yager, she was
               very animated and upset. Yager was forthcoming but I question
               her accuracy of the events. I went to Swanson's room and again
               asked if she was ok with me looking at her clothes. Swanson
               said it was ok and I told her what I was looking for. Swanson
               said she only had one jeans jacket but no vest. Swanson showed
               me the jacket which was Rue 21 brand not Avercrombie and Fitch.
               Swanson also showed me a pink sweater with lace on the back but
               it again was not the brand that Yager had described. I told
               Swanson how student conduct and hall staff could get involved
               in this case. I also provided Swanson with my business card and
               her case number. Throughout my contact with Swanson, I found
               her to be calm and forthcoming. I have no reason to believe
               Swanson was being untruthful with me. At 2343 hours Cpl.
               Daniels and I cleared. Swanson had the right to use force to
               remove Yager from her room when Yager refused to do so. Based
               on my investigation, the amount of force used by Swanson to
               move Yager out of her room was reasonable and no crime
               occurred. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 3rd day of March,
               2014, in Pullman, Washington.
