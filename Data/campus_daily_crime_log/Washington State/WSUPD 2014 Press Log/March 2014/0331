               vehicle collision. DRIVER 1: Ryan A. Taylor (DOB 11-16-1994)

               INSURANCE: Safeco Insurance / #M1684785 / exp. 08-21-2014
               DAMAGE: passenger side front quarter panel and front bumper
               DAMAGE VALUE: $2000.00 WITNESS(ES): Wesley D. Pinard (DOB 08-
               26-1986) NARRATIVE: On 03-31-2014 at about 0718 hrs I was
               dispatched to a non-injury vehicle collision on Grimes Way near
               the Washington State University Grounds Shop, located at 2325
               NE Grimes Way. Assistant Chief Hansen and I arrived on scene,
               and I contacted the following individuals: Ryan A. Taylor (DOB
               11-16-1994), Kenneth W. Twitchell (DOB 07-04-1959), and Wesley
               D. Pinard (DOB 08-26-1986). Taylor was the driver of a tan,
               2003 Toyota Camry (WA Lic. ABK7988). Twitchell was the driver
               of a red, 2006 Chevrolet Cobalt (WA Lic. 1LB5773). Pinard was a
               pedestrian in the area who witnessed the collision. There were
               no other passengers or witnesses. After speaking with all of
               the individuals, I determined the following: Twitchell was
               travelling eastbound on Grimes Way. Taylor was also travelling
               eastbound on Grimes Way and was in front of Twitchell. Taylor
               pulled over to the right side of the roadway near the entrance
               to the grounds shop. Taylor then moved left back across the
               eastbound lane of travel and began making a u-turn. Taylor did
               not see Twitchell in the eastbound lane and turned directly in
               front of him at the start of his u-turn. Twitchell could not
               avoid a collision with Taylor's vehicle. The passenger side
               front of Twitchell's vehicle struck the driver side front of
               Taylor's vehicle. Twitchell and Taylor did not complain of any
               injuries. The damage to the vehicles was consistent with the
               information provided by the drivers. Twitchell's vehicle had
               been moved prior to my arrival. Assistant Chief Hansen
               photographed the scene, and the photographs have been
               downloaded into Spillman. I gave Taylor a verbal warning for
               improper u-turn. Taylor requested a tow truck, and Autobody
               Supercenter arrived on scene and towed his vehicle. I completed
               a Sector PTCR. No further action at this time. Olmstead/339 I

               Director of Rogers Hall, reported the mysterious opening of two

               hours Sunday morning, 3/30/14, and found her door open. The
               door chain was attached which prevented the door from opening
               completely. Gilmore said both residents reported nothing was
               disturbed or missing from their rooms. Both residents believed
               their doors were locked when the went to bed. Gilmore was asked
               if all of their Master Keys for Rogers Hall were accounted for.
               Gilmore said they had checked their keys, and they were all

               was dispatched to a report of a possible fraud and identity
               theft. I was asked to contact the reporting party, Bryawna S
               Yager (082195), at her residence and upon my arrival was told
               the following. Yager explained that she had recently contacted
               the Washington State Employee's Credit Union about trying to up
               her credit limit on her credit card. As part of that process
               they conducted a credit check when showed she had an account in
               collections from 2009. Yager told me she is appealing this
               claim, since at the time she was 13 years old and did not have
               an account with Century Link. I asked her what service was
               being provided and was told it was an internet account and was
               located at her mothers home in Tacoma. She went on to explain
               that she has not lived with her mother for several years due to
               abuse claims and that she was removed from the home and awarded
               to her brother by the court as a result. When asked why her
               mother would use her social security number to open an account
               in her name she told her mother has a history of doing things
               such as this. We spoke again about the timeframe for this
               incident and after which I explained that she would need to
               speak with Pierce County or Tacoma regarding this incident. We
               also discussed how to secure her social security number from
               further use as well as checking her credit to insure there were
               no other accounts open in her name. Yager told me she was going
               back home next weekend and would have all the information I
               suggested she try to obtain to give to the deputies. I provided
               her with my business card along with the case number for
               reference and cleared a short time later. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 033114 I was dispatched to a report
               of a civil problem and asked to contact the reporting party,
               identified as Derek E De La Rosa (062894), by phone. Upon
               reaching him I was told the following. De La Rosa explained
               that he had recently purchased a motorcycle from an individual.
               He had been told the motorcycle was in good shape and
               approximately three days later he began to drive to Spokane.
               Around 10 miles outside of Spokane the motorcycle began to have
               issues and quit running. De La Rosa was able to get the
               motorcycle to a shop and later learned that the motorcycle was
               only running on one cylinder and had other issues prior to it's
               purchase. De La Rosa understood this was a civil issue and
               wanted information on how to take take the individual to civil
               court to resolve this matter. We spoke about this and he was
               given information on contacting District Court to obtain and
               fill out the necessary paperwork. After speaking with him I
               cleared a short time later. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               31st day of March, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               the vehicle and activated my emergency lights. I contacted the
               driver, Samantha M. Woolwine (081095), who told me she had

               and we got the vehicle to start. I had Woolwine drive to the

               arrived there. Woolwine said she would wait for AAA at Beasley.
               I provided her with Whitcom's number in case she needed me to

               dispatched to the report of marijuana in room 221 Stephenson
               South. I responded and met with RED Griffin. Ofc. Westerman

               vaporizer in his room. He had a jar of marijuana, some
               marijuana in his vaporizer, and trace amounts in his grinder.
               He would have had less than 20 grams. He disposed of his
               marijuana. He was informed he would be referred to Student

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 03/31/14 at approximately 2243 hours,
               I was monitoring traffic on Olympia Ave near Global Animal
               Health when I noticed a Honda sedan heading westbound on
               Olympia Ave near the observatory. The Honda appeared to be
               traveling faster than the posted 20 MPH zone. I activated my
               handheld radar (Decatur Scout) and obtained a reading of 31
               MPH. When the Honda passed my location I pulled behind it and
               initiated a traffic stop. I contacted the driver, Nuredin
               Ebrahim Abdi 06/16/95, identified myself, informed Abdi I was
               recording, and explained the reason for the stop. I asked for
               Abdi's driver's license. Abdi provided his WADL and asked for
               his vehicle registration and proof of insurance. While Abdi was
               looking for his documents I could clearly smell the odor of
               burnt marijuana coming from the car. Once Abdi provided his
               documents I asked him how much marijuana was in the car. Abdi
               said he did not have any. I asked why his car smelled of
               marijuana. Abdi said a friend of his had smoked marijuana in
               his car a few days ago. I asked Abdi if I could search his car
               to verify there was no marijuana. Abdi said I could search.
               Abdi and his passenger (not identified) exited the car. The
               passenger grabbed his backpack from the car and I asked why he
               was taking it. The passenger said Abdi told him to. Without
               prompt the passenger said I could look in his backpack. I
               looked through the backpack and found no illegal items. Before
               I started my search I advised Abdi of his Ferrier Warnings.
               After advising Abdi he said he did not want me to search
               because he was in a hurry. Due to Abdi being under 21 and the
               odor of burnt marijuana I asked Abdi if he was willing to do
               some voluntary field sobriety tests. Abdi said he would. After
               the SFST tests, it was my determination that Abdi had not
               recently smoked marijuana. I explained my observations to Abdi
               and again asked how long ago had he smoked. Abdi said he had
               smoked marijuana around midnight the previous night but not
               since then. I had Abdi sit back in his car while I filled out a
               Sector NOI for his speed. Once the NOI was issued I told Abdi
               that he would be referred to student conduct for his drug
               usage. Abdi said he understood. Nothing further. I certify and

               NARRATIVE: On 04/01/14 at approximately 0023 hours I was
               dispatched to an assault call in the area of Stadium Way and
               Colorado St. Upon arrival I found David S. Nydam 11/04/78,
               standing on the corner of Orchard Dr. and Stadium Way. I asked
               Nydam what happened. Nydam provided the following story: Nydam
               was walking northbound through the crosswalk that crosses
               Orchard Dr. There was a black male at the northeast corner of
               intersection. The male started to walk eastbound on Orchard Dr.
               as Nydam was about to reach that same corner. When Nydam walked
               past the male he was hit in the face with a snowball. The male
               took off running southbound on Stadium Way. Nydam ran after the
               male. The male ran down Stadium Way, past North Fairway, and
               run across the road just before Ferdinand's Lane. The male ran
               over to a red SUV that had stopped in the middle of the road to
               pick up the male. The male got into the SUV and the SUV took
               off southbound on Stadium Way. Nydam walked back to Stadium Way
               and Colorado and called 911. Nydam said he had no idea why the
               male threw the snowball at him. Nydam said he remembered seeing
               the SUV sitting on the side of the road on Orchard Dr. just
               before he was hit by the snowball. Nydam described the vehicle
               as a red smaller SUV but bigger than a car. Nydam said that was
               the best description he had. Nydam also stated that the only
               things he remembered about the male was that he was black,
               wearing a red sweatshirt, with short black hair. I asked Nydam
               if he needed medical attention. Nydam said no. Nydam said he
               was hit in the right side of the face just below his eye. I
               could see a red mark on the right side of his face and I took a
               picture of the redness. I returned to the station to review the
               surveillance video footage of Stadium Way. After reviewing the
               camera footage, it shows an individual running down the side
               east sidewalk of Stadium Way. A small SUV stopped in the
               southbound traffic lanes and the male ran across Stadium Way,
               in front of the SUV, and go it. The SUV took off southbound on
               Stadium Way. I reviewed the camera footage at the intersection
               of Stadium Way and Grimes Way but the SUV never passed. It is
               believed that the SUV took a left turn on Wilson Rd heading
               eastbound. Ofc. Petlovany remembered a large pile of unmelted

               snow at Hawthorne Circle. This is consistent with the direction
               of travel that the SUV took. I responded to the snow pile on
               Hawthorne Circle and did not see any new tire marks in the mud.
               Cpl. Daniels, Ofc. Welter, Ofc. Petlovany, and I searched for
               the SUV. We ran several SUV's that loosely fit the description
               provided by Nydam. None of the vehicles had any evidence of

               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W1251 SYNOPSIS: Talib called 911
               on a PATS phone because he was drunk and having trouble getting
               home. Talib was taken home via taxi. Talib will be referred to

               OTHER UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 04/01/14 at approximately 0204
               hours, I was dispatched to a male, Saeed Talib 12/17/77, who
               had called 911 on a PATS phone next to Albrook Lab. Dispatch
               said the male spoke broken English but was able to say that he
               needed help getting home to Forest Way before hanging up. Upon
               arrival I searched the area of Albrook but found nobody
               outside. I finally found Talib next to Sloan Hall talking with
               another male. I recognized Talib because I was one of the
               Officers who had found him face down in a snow bank on
               02/06/14. On 02/06/14 Talib was so intoxicated that he could
               not walk or talk. I asked the male next to Talib what was going
               on. The male said he had found Talib stumbling around by Sloan
               and had called a taxi to take him home. I asked Talib if he was
               ok. Talib said yes. Talib was very intoxicated and was having a
               lot of difficulty standing still without leaning on something.
               About this time the Taxi arrived and I asked Talib if he wanted
               to take the taxi him. Talid said he did and the taxi driver
               agreed. Talib was taken home by the taxi and I cleared. This is
               the second time that I have contacted Talib while he has been
               extremely intoxicated. I believe that Talib may have an alcohol
               problem. My case was emailed to WSU Counseling Services on
               04/01/14. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 1st day of April,
               2014, in Pullman, Washington.
