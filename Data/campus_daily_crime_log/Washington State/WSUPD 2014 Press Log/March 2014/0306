               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 03/06/14 at approximately 1115 hours
               Pullman PD requested that I respond to a traffic stop of theirs
               on SR 270 near Avista. I responded and spoke with Ofc. Crow who
               told me the driver was called in by PRH staff concerned that he
               should not be driving due to medications he received. I spoke
               with the driver and learned he was administered several
               narcotic analgesics today. The driver also provided me a list
               of medications he should be taking, but did not know if he took
               them. After talking with the driver at length I determined it
               was probably not safe for him to drive, but I also believe he
               might have mental health issues. The driver declined field
               sobriety tests and there was no driving issues observed. We
               convinced the driver to allow me to safely park the vehicle off
               the roadway and get a taxi. I did not identify the driver other
               than by his first name, Randy. Nothing further. See Pullman
               report for complete details. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 6th day of

               hours I was dispatched to the report of a theft. The RP,
               William D. Nicewonger, was in the lobby for contact. I
               contacted Nicewonger and he told me that his wallet was stolen
               from his dorm room at Goldsworthy 616 on Sunday, March 2, 2014.
               He told me that the last time he saw it was around 3pm on that
               day. He explained that his room is a "transit room" and
               described many people in and out on any given day. He said that
               he does not know who may have taken it or why. He was unable to
               provide any names of people who had been in his room.
               Nicewonger described his wallet as a brown, bi-fold Fossil
               wallet with a money clip. He said inside his wallet was three
               debit cards, his Washington State Driver's License, his
               Military ID, three military weapons cards and various club
               cards. He said that there was no cash in the wallet. Nicewonger
               said he has been monitoring his bank accounts and has not seen
               any suspicious activity. He told me that he just needed a case
               number to provide to his military base in order to get a new
               military ID issued. I gave Nicewonger my business card with the
               case number. He said he would be cancelling his debit cards. No
               suspects or leads. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 6th day of March,

               contacted Neil P. Baldwin (11-26-93) in the room. Baldwin
               admitted to having smoked marijuana in his room. He agreed to

               06-14, Officer Boyd and I responded to Orton Hall and met the
               Residential Educational Director, Earl E. Lee, in the hall
               lobby. Lee stated one of his staff members reported smelling
               the odor of marijuana emitting from within room 832. Lee said
               he verified the odor emitting from within the room. We then all
               responded to the 8th floor. Officer Boyd and I walked down the
               hallway and the odor of marijuana became extremely strong at
               room 832. I knocked on the door and a male, identified by his
               WADL as Neil P. Baldwin, opened the door. I asked if he knew
               why we were at his door and he said "Yes", opened his door
               wider, and invited us in. I entered the room and asked if he
               had a medical marijuana prescription. He said he did not. I
               told him if he were willing to destroy what marijuana he had, I
               would not file any criminal charges and have the case handled
               through the WSU Office of Student Standards and Accountability.
               He said that was fine and retrieved two sandwich bags
               containing a total of less than one gram of marijuana. He
               agreed to take the marijuana down to the bathroom and flush it
               down the toilet. I watched him as he did so. I told him he was
               free to leave and advised him not to smoke or have marijuana on
               campus. I informed hall staff of what occurred and cleared.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 7th day of March, 2014, in
               Pullman, Washington. _______________________________________

               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W0913 SYNOPSIS: Subject was found
               masturbating and feels he is being mocked by his RA. Referring
               to RED for hall. NAME/DOB: CITE/SECTOR#: OFFENSE: REFERRALS:

               ____CNSL SRV Sent?_____OFC/ WSU STUDENT: ____YES ____NO OTHER
               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 030614 I was dispatched to a
               Harassment. I contacted the RP, Travis W. Frymier (072995), by
               phone as requested. His roommate had walked in on him
               masturbating and he thought the subject would not go any
               further. Then he found on the hall bulletin board signs that he
               feels are mocking him. The bulletin board has a headline of
               "Door". One sign reads "Closed and Locked", then when you open
               the sign it says "Eli", who is apparently a resident who is
               known for locking his door. The second sign reads "Closed and
               Unlocked", then when opened reads "Wheels O_O". "Wheels" is
               Frymier's undesired nickname as he had broken his leg and had
               been required to roll around on a scooter to support his leg.
               The bulletin board is run by Hall staff and Frymier suspects
               his RA Marco of posting the signs. Frymier sent me pictures of
               the signs. I explained Harassment, Student Conduct, and
               Bullying issues to Frymier. I asked what avenues he would like
               me to pursue as I did not detect a crime at this point. He
               agreed to have me contact RED Alrashoodi to have her check with
               her RA's to maintain some of Frymier's confidentiality. I
               provided Frymier with his case number and my contact
               information in case this escalated. I then spoke with
               Alrashoodi and asked her to follow up with hall staff. I
               requested she let me know who had placed the items on the
               bulletin board. I emailed her the photos. Later on, Alrashoodi
               confirmed Marco A. Moreno (102293) had been the one who placed
               the items on the bulletin board as she had printed out his
               bulletin board information. It appears he was doing it as a
               Public Service Announcement that was misguided. Alrashoodi is
               following up with him to determine disciplinary actions. I
               recommended following up with Frymier to reassure him of the
               professionalism of their staff. Case closed. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               6th day of March, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               NARRATIVE: On 03/06/14 at about 2219 hrs Dispatch advised of an
               RED reporting the odor of marijuana coming from room 531 Streit
               Hall. I responded and could smell the odor of burnt marijuana
               emitting from the room. I knocked on the door and contacted the
               residents of the room Serapia Castellanos (082994) and Jessica
               Mejia (050394). I asked if they had medical marijuana cards and
               they said they did not. I told them I could smell the odor of
               marijuana coming from their room. I told them they had two
               options, they could retrieve whatever marijuana was in the room
               and we could destroy it and it would be sent to student conduct
               only. I told them the second option was to require I obtain a
               search warrant, which may or may not be granted. I told them if
               the search warrant was granted I would return and whatever was
               found during the search would be dealt with through the court
               as well as student conduct. Mejia agreed to go into the room
               and retrieve the marijuana. She returned with an apple which
               had a hold punched in it, turning it into a smoking device. On
               top of the apple was a small amount of burnt marijuana. Mejia
               said some friends brought the marijuana over. Castellanos said
               she was present during the smoking of the marijuana but did not
               smoke the marijuana herself. I walked Mejia down to the
               dumpster where she disposed of the apple and marijuana. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 07 day of March, 2014, in Pullman,
