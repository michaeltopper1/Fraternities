               approximately 1300 hours I was dispatched to a fraud call in
               the WSUPD lobby. I met with the reporting party, Prabodh
               Dhakal. Dhakal explained that on 03/24/14 between 1100-1130
               hours he received a phone call from a subject named John. John
               claimed to be from the IRS and told Dhakal he owed the IRS
               $3650 dollars from incorrect tax returns dating between 2005-
               2010. Dhakal said John requested he go to Walmart or Moneytree
               to transfer money to an account. Dhakal suspected this to be a
               scam so he did not do it. Dhakal reported it to the
               International Student programs who told him to report it to the
               police. The program also contacted the IRS and made them aware
               of the situation. Dhakal said he has already contacted his
               financial institutions as well. Dhakal also contacted the IRS
               who informed him he did not owe any money. I completed a press
               release to post on WSUPD's social media sites to warn others of
               the situation. Nothing further. I certify and declare under

               NARRATIVE: On 032614 around 1907 hrs I was dispatched to a
               report of a violation of a court order. I contacted the
               reporting party, identified as Rita D Best (030693), and was
               told the following. Best explained that her girlfriend, later
               identified as Marina A Martin (081993), had been involved in a
               case involving Daquawn D Brown (082295). According to Best
               after Brown had been taken to jail their was a protection order
               put in place to protect Martin from Brown. I asked if Best had
               a contact number for Martin so I could speak to her and after
               being given the number contacted her and was told the
               following. Martin explained that earlier she had been at the
               Northside Dining Center when Brown came up to her and asked her
               where the take out boxes were for food. According to Martin she
               was lead to believe that there was a protection order in place
               and that Brown shouldn't have been speaking to her as a
               condition of his release. I asked her if she had a protection
               order against Brown and was told she did not, which matched
               what Whitcom had told me earlier. I explained to her that I
               would do some further checking and speak with Brown, but that
               if there was not any orders in place there was not much I could
               do. We continued to speak on this issue for some time before I
               asked her if she had told Brown that she did not wish to speak
               with him and was told she had not. I told Martin that after I
               looked into this some more I would contact her and let her know
               what I found out. After speaking with Martin I attempted to
               contact Brown and left him a message to call me after which I
               contacted the Whitman County Jail to check on his conditions of
               release. I was told Brown was not to contact Martin or attempt
               to contact her through third parties, but that the order may
               have changed so it was best to check with the court first
               before proceeding. At this point I contacted Merritt Decker of
               the Whitman County Prosecutors Office regarding this case.
               Decker told me he was unfamiliar with Brown and after
               explaining this case and having found no orders other than the
               conditions of release from custody he asked me not to make an
               arrest and email him with what I had found out. I told him I
               would do that and tried to contact Brown again. Upon reaching

               Brown I asked him if he had spoken with anyone at the Northside
               Dining Center earlier. He told me he had asked a female he did
               not know where he could find a to go box but that was it. At
               hearing this I asked him if he recalled the conditions of his
               release and he confirmed that he was not supposed to contact
               the victim from his previous case, which he told me he didn't
               know anyway. I confirmed that he didn't know Martin, and he
               became upset about trying to stay out of trouble and having
               false accusations. At hearing this I asked him what his
               relationship was with Martin and he again told me he doesn't
               even know who she is. He went on to tell me he has never hung
               out with her and wouldn't know her from anyone else. Upon
               learning this we discussed the potential legal consequences for
               violating his order. He told me he understood and I explained
               that I would be sending this information to the prosecutors
               office at their request. He told me he understood and we
               concluded our call. I later contacted Martin again and asked
               her about her relationship with Brown. She again told me she
               had not filed a restraining order with the court over this
               issue. She went on to tell me she doesn't know Brown on a
               social level and has never hung out with him. I explained to
               her that Brown had told me he doesn't even know who she is and
               that I would be sending this report over to the prosecutor at
               his request. Martin told me she understood and after speaking
               with her I emailed Decker what I had learned and cleared.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 27th day of March, 2014, in

               26-14, at approximately 2210 hours, I was dispatched to Orton
               Hall regarding the odor of marijuana. Whitcom said hall staff
               reported the odor of marijuana coming from a male on the 9th
               floor of Orton Hall. I responded to Orton Hall and took the
               elevator to the 9th floor. Upon exiting the elevator I saw hall
               staff sitting in the entry way with a male, later identified as
               Nicholas A. Sotelo (01-11-94). I asked the hall staff what was
               going on and they said as they were walking down the hallway of
               the 9th floor they smelled an overpowering odor of marijuana
               emitting from within room 937. As one of the hall staff members
               was walking by the room, Sotelo exited the room. The hall staff
               member asked him if he would be willing to come talk to her and
               he agreed. She told him she had called the "On Duty" RED and
               was waiting for him to arrive. After the "On Duty" RED arrived,
               he went to smell the door of room 937. He verified the
               overpowering odor of what he described as "Fresh Marijuana". He
               then called Whitcom to report the incident and ask for a Police
               Officer to respond. Whitcom relayed a male smelled like
               marijuana rather than the room smelled of marijuana. I did not
               apply for a search warrant and responded directly to the 9th
               floor of Orton Hall. I asked Sotelo if he had a medical
               marijuana prescription and he said he did not. I asked him if
               he smokes marijuana and he said he does. I asked him if he had
               smoked it on 03-26-14, prior to me contacting him and he said
               he did. I asked him if he smoked it in his room and he said he
               did not. I asked him if he smoked it on the WSU campus in
               Pullman and he said he did not. I asked him if he had any
               marijuana in his room and he said he did not. I asked him if he
               would allow me to conduct a quick search of his room to verify
               he was telling me the truth and he said he would not allow me
               to search his room. I told him that was within his right, but
               asked him why he did not want me searching his room. He told me
               he was going to exercise his 5th amendment right and did not
               want to comment further. I told him he would be contacted by
               the WSU Office of Student Standards and Accountability and
               asked him if he had any questions. He said he did not so I
               cleared. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
