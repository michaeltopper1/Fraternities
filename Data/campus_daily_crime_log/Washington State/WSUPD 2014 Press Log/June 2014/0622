               NARRATIVE: On June 22, 2014 at about 1117 hours Pullman Police
               personnel requested the assistance of WSU Police regarding a
               domestic dispute call at 210 NW Anthony St #4. Officer Olmstead
               and I responded. Pullman Police canceled our response prior to
               our arrival. Soon after canceling they requested an officer
               respond. I responded to the scene as I was only a block away. I
               assisted Officer Emerson in dealing with Ryan Lamance who was
               detained and later placed under arrest. Lamance said he had
               used drugs (meth) within the past 24 hours. He appeared to be
               under the influence of drugs as he was highly verbal, agitated,
               and emotional. Lamance could not sit or stand still. His body
               was constantly moving even while handcuffed. Lamance was
               transported to Pullman Police Department by Officer Emerson. I
               was asked to respond to the department to assist in dealing
               with Lamance. Pullman Fire personnel were at the jail to
               evaluate Lamance as he had complained of an injured hand.
               Lamance removed a cast on one of his hands sometime during the
               incident. Officer Emerson and I successfully placed Lamance in
               a temporary holding cell until he could be transported by
               Pullman Police to Pullman Regional Hospital for medical care.
               Assistance was provided. VieVu video has been downloaded. No
               further investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 22nd day of June,
               2014, in Pullman, Washington.
