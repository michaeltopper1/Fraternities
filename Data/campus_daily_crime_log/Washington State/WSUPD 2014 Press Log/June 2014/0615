               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W2290 SYNOPSIS: Burglary at Nez
               Perce Apartment J35. Asus Laptop stolen. No suspects or leads.

               COUNSELING SRV OTHER: OEO Sent? CNSL SRV Sent? WSU STUDENT: YES
               XXNO OTHER UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 061514 at approximately
               1558 hours, I was dispatched to contact Allison R. Draffin
               regarding a burglary report. Upon contact, Draffin told me the
               following. She left Pullman on 060814 at approximately 1100
               hours. When she left, she wasn't sure she locked the back door.
               On 061514, her neighbor, Faustino, called her and told her he
               believes that someone went in her apartment this past week. She
               stated that she is in Kentucky and that nobody should have been
               in her apartment. She stated that her friend Bryan J. Bolyard
               has a key to her apartment and was going to meet me there after
               speaking to her. I asked her if she knew if anything was
               missing and she told me that Bryan had already been in her
               apartment and noticed that her laptop was missing from the
               dining room table. Draffin described her laptop as a black Asus
               G73 gaming laptop that is approximately 5 years old and she
               valued it at approximately $500.00. She stated it has a 17 inch
               screen and a crack in the plastic att he universal port where
               the SD card would go. Draffin was unable to provide me with her
               laptop serial number at this time. She told me that laptop was
               one of five devices she uses on the WSU Network and provided me
               with her Network ID of allison.draffin for MAC address
               tracking. I advised her that with five different devices, she
               would need to email me with the WIFI addresses of each of the
               devices she currently uses to narrow down which one the Asus
               was. She told me she would email me with the information. When
               she provides me with other MAC addresses of the devices she is
               in possession of, I will email WSUPD IT Security and have her
               computer flagged on the WSU Network. I responded to the
               apartment where Bolyard was waiting for me. I checked the
               apartment for forced entry and was unable to determine that
               there was any forced entry. Bolyard told me that when he got to
               the apartment, the back door was unlocked and the stick that
               usually goes behind the slider was not in place. I checked the
               back door for fingerprints and was unable to find any. I asked
               Bolyard why Faustino thought someone had entered her apartment,
               and he stated that Faustino some suspicious people in the front
               area of the apartment on 061114 or 061214. I asked Bolyard for
               Faustino's phone number and he provided it to me. I contacted
               Faustino P. Lukolo who told me that on 061514 at approximately

               0600 hours he was walking his dog behind the J Building and
               noticed that Draffin's apartment door was wide open. He pulled
               the door closed and texted Draffin. He stated that Draffin
               didn't seem to be alarmed or surprised at all that her
               apartment was unsecure. She stated that she would have Bolyard
               respond and make sure the door was locked. Lukolo told me that
               he was talking with other residents of the J building and they
               told him that her back door has been wide open off and on for
               the past three weeks so they didn't think anything of the
               apartment being unsecure this morning. I thanked Lukolo for the
               information and ended the call. Case inactive pending further
               leads. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the
               laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 15th day of June, 2014, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Kelly
