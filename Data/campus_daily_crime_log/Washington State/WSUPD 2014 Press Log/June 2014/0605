               DEPARTMENT ** COLLISION REPORT ** CASE #: 14-W2202 SYNOPSIS:
               Report of a hit and run collision which occurred sometime
               between 0800 hrs on 052714 and 0900 hrs on 060414. DRIVER 1:
               VEHICLE 1: INSURANCE: DAMAGE: DRIVER 2: VEHICLE/PROPERTY 2:
               Chain link fence gate INSURANCE: Self Insured DAMAGE: $ 900.00
               WITNESS(ES): NARRATIVE: On 060514 around 1030 hrs I was
               dispatched to a report of a hit and run collision in the
               Holland Parking Garage near the Compton Union loading dock.
               Upon my arrival I noticed that a sliding chain link fence had
               been bent over and was leaning into an area which contained
               wooden pallets. As I examined the fencing I noticed on the left
               center post that it appeared to have been damaged approximately
               3 1/2 feet up from its base. I could also see what appeared to
               be black paint transfer on the post. As I examined the fencing
               I also noticed the opposite post had also been damaged around
               the same height as the first post I looked at. Upon closer
               inspection I also noticed black paint transfer on the second
               post as well. In addition to the damage to the posts and
               fencing that I had observed I noticed that the force of the
               impact had peeled the base and bolts from the concrete. I
               photographed the area and contacted Karee A Shaw (052777) and
               was told the following. Shaw explained that she had received an
               email from Wayne Gregory on 060414 with photos of the gate
               being damaged. She went on to tell me she had did not know when
               it had been damaged but believed it had been between 052714 and
               060414. Shaw did not have any idea who had caused the damage
               and when asked about having reviewed the video footage from the
               camera in the garage told me she had not. I provided her with
               my business card and case number for reference and cleared.
               Upon my return to the WSU Police Department I reviewed the
               video footage along with Cpl Daniels and noticed the gate in
               question is not in view of the camera. I also contacted
               Facilities Operations and asked about anyone having seen when
               the fencing may have been damaged. I am awaiting a phone call
               back in an attempt to narrow the time frame. At this point I
               have no suspects and no leads. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 5th day of
