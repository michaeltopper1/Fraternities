               __X__NO OTHER UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 06/28/14 at
               approximately 2115 hours I was dispatched to the Ungulate
               Facility at the Steffen Center for a suspicious call. The
               reporting party, Miranda Crowell, said there was a male subject
               wearing khaki shorts behind the Ungulate facility taking
               pictures. Ofc. Petlovany and I responded. While enroute I
               noticed a Blue 4Runner parked at the Bear Pens (which Ofc.
               Petlovany later ran WA ABX9058). I arrived at the Steffen
               Center and noticed the front gate was closed. I entered the
               facility and while driving to the Ungulate area I saw two males
               (one of which was wearing khaki shorts) walking down the road
               towards me. I activated my VieVu camera around this time. The
               male in the khaki shorts took off running to the west. I asked
               the other male what his friend's name was and he said "Dave". I
               yelled to Dave to come back. The subject came back to our
               location. Ofc. Petlovany arrived no scene shortly after this. I
               asked the two what they were doing and they said they were
               taking pictures of scenery. I asked them how they entered the
               facility and they said they walked along the trails across from
               the Bear Pens. I know there are groomed walking trails in the
               USDA area across from the Bear Pens. The subjects said they
               were walking near the bee hives. I asked them what they were
               taking pictures of and they said the scenery. I asked for their
               IDs and the subject in the shorts provided me with his WADL
               identifying him as David R. Geppert 12/29/60 and the other
               subject verbally identified himself as Michael E. landers
               03/17/58. I asked Geppert why he ran when I arrived and he said
               he didn't realize who I was. I asked them where they worked and
               Geppert said he worked for Fac Ops and Landers said he worked
               at Owen Science. The subjects offered for me to look at their
               pictures, but I declined. I warned the two about trespassing
               and told them to stay on trails and follow the signs posted. I
               contacted Crowell and advised her of my findings. Case to be
               forwarded to Charlie Powell. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 28th day of
               June, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.
