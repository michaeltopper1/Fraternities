               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 06/25/14 at approximately 1250 hours
               Corporal Daniels and I were dispatched to a no injury accident
               that had occurred at the loading dock area of the Vet Med
               Bioresearch Building at 1815 NE Ferdinands Ln. The drivers of
               both vehicles had exchanged information and left the immediate
               scene. We contacted one of the drivers Erin M Cooper (DOB
               060584) at Vet Med Bioresearch Building Room G10. Cooper stated
               that she had entered the loading dock area bringing rats to the
               facility for her research. She was driving an all black FJ
               Cruiser license WA/AOP5203. The other vehicle was a freight
               truck from Diamond Freight Systems truck #102 license
               WA/B67968Z driven by Keith R Pollard (DOB 101476). Cooper
               stated that both vehicles parked and she had a short
               conversation with Keith about their deliveries and then she
               opened both driver side doors of her vehicle to get the rats
               out. She loaded the rats on to the dock and left her vehicle
               doors open. At that point Pollard pulled away from the dock and
               his truck caught the front driver side door of the FJ and bent
               it all the way forward. Cooper flagged down Pollard and they
               exchanged insurance information. Cooper was able to close the
               door to her vehicle and park in the parking lot. Pollard
               continued on his delivery route. At approximately 1400 hours I
               called Diamond Freight Systems Inc and spoke with John Coins
               about the vehicle collision. Coins gave me the vehicle,
               driver's information, and company vehicle insurance
               information. Coins also stated that he had spoken to his driver
               about the incident. I asked Coins to email a statement about
               what he had been told and to have his driver Pollard also to
               email a statement. Officer Curtis Whitman Washington State
               University PD Wed Jun 25 15:19:20 PDT 2014 I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 06-25-14 I was waiting for traffic at
               the intersection of Stadium Way and Wilson when I noticed a
               dark blue BMW sedan, WA/Lic AMK3028, traveling south on Stadium
               Way. I saw that there was no front license plate attached to
               the front of the vehicle. I saw that there was a Washington
               State license plate on the front dash. I turned right onto
               Stadium Way and activated my emergency lights. The vehicle
               finally stopped at the entrance to the CUE Parking structure. I
               contacted the driver a Guangjie Zhu and informed him the reason
               for the stop. I asked him for his drivers license, proof of
               insurance and vehicle registration. He provide all the items
               requested. I had WHITCOM run Zhu through DOL and he came back
               DWLS 3rd for un-paid tickets. I re-approached the vehicle and
               told Zhu that his driving privileges in the state of Washington
               had been suspended due to un-paid tickets. I asked him if he
               knew his license had been suspended. He said he did and was
               trying to take care of the problem. I told him they he was not
               free to leave and that I was going to issue him a citation for
               the suspension. He said he understood. I returned to he vehicle
               after writing the citation. I told Zhu that he was not going to
               be allowed to drive home due to the suspension. I asked him
               what he wanted to do with his vehicle and he asked that I move
               it into the parking lot next to the CUE. I moved the vehicle. I
               again told Zhu that he was not to drive the vehicle. He said he
               had a friend on the way to drive him home. I issued him the
               citation for DWLS 3rd and left the scene. When I left Zhu was
               standing by his vehicle. Nothing further............. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
