               WSU STUDENT: ____YES ____NO OTHER UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 23
               June at about 1141 hours, WSU PD was dispatched to an
               unconscious male east side of Beasley Coliseum. Upon arriving I
               found a two males standing over another male on the ground. I
               went over to the male on the ground who was on his back near
               the inside wall. He had white frothy spittle coming from his
               mouth. I checked his carotid artery for pulse and was unable to
               locate a pulse. I started CPR and continued until Pullman
               medical personnel arrived at which time they took over medical
               care. I identified the males as Balram Pande and Zachary V.
               Paulsen. Pande identified the male patient as Jim Frasure.
               Paulsen stated he had come into the Beasley to use the restroom
               when he saw Frasure on the ground. Paulsen called 911 when he
               couldn't get Frasure to respond. Pande stated he got to Beasley
               around 0900 hours. He said Frasure walked into the office
               around 1000 and Pande commented to him he didn't know he was
               even here at which Frasure commented he was over at Martin
               Stadium working oh cleaning and organizing the commissary.
               During the conversation Frasure commented he had a headache.
               Pande left around 1115 hours and didn't return to Beasley until
               about 1140 hours. He stated when he returned is when he saw
               Frasure on the ground with Paulsen standing over him talking on
               the phone. At 1217 hours, Pullman medical called the time of
               death. Whitcom was advised to call Whitman County Coroner. The
               Chief Deputy Coroner, Annie Pillers, arrived to start the death
               investigation. Pictures were taken of the scene and body. I
               located a hand print and sweat marks on a poster near Frasure's
               body. The Coronor Pete Martin arrived along with Kimbal Funeral
               home. Martin stated Frasure's body would be transported to
               Kimbal Funeral home and an Autopsy would be performed in the
               next couple of days. Martin stated WSU PD would be notified of
               the date and time of the autopsy. I took measurement of the
               bodies location as I remembered it upon my arrival. The two
               anchor points for the measurements were the corners of the
               concrete pillars on the outside of the concourse. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 06-23-14 I was dispatched to a

               wanting an officer to contact him about a possible harassment
               on camput. I called Bill. He stated that he has an employee,
               that he would not name, that has made some statements to him
               that he thought might me of a harassing tone. Bill stated that
               he wrote up a statement and gave it to HRS, but wanted some
               information about what to do if it continues. I asked him to
               explain the situation. He stated that he didn't want to give

               anything else happen. He was appricative and ended the call.
