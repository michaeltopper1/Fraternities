               a parking permit from a vehicle (Wa. ALX3934), which wad been

               complainant, later identified as Therese L Jones (071387), and
               was told the following. Jones explained she had parked her
               vehicle in the Red 3 parking lot around 1030 hrs and when she
               returned around 1230 hrs she noticed she had a parking ticket
               on her window with a time stamp of 1159 hrs. I asked her if the
               doors had been locked and she told me she usually locks the
               doors, but when she used her key to open the door she noticed
               several items strewn about on her dashboard which had not been
               there before. She went on to tell me nothing else appeared to
               be missing. After speaking for a bit regarding this I
               instructed her to contact parking services regarding the theft,
               and told her I would do the same thing before concluding our
               call. I later contacted Parking Services and informed them of
               the theft. I was told the current value of the permit was
               $50.27 and that they would flag it in their system. I thanked
               them and cleared. Nothing further at this time. I certify and

               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               courts on N. Fairway until he arrived at Bohler Gym. When I
               arrived, he was just returning on foot after scouting the
               tennis courts. I waited while they turned their vehicles around
               and left. We had been called because Reeves was not sure of
               where to park. He had figured it out when I arrived. I cleared.

               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #:14-W2323 SYNOPSIS: Report of a
               Quadcopter and GoPro that were possibly stolen. No suspects or
               leads. NAME/DOB: Travis S. Anderson 12/18/73 CITE/SECTOR#:

               STUDENT: ____YES ___X_NO OTHER UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On
               06/16/14 I was contacted by Travis Anderson reference a
               possibly stolen Quadcopter and GoPro. Anderson explained that
               on 06/06/14 at approximately 1200 he was at the Valley Rd.
               playfields towards the west side of the field. Anderson said he
               was flying his remote controlled Quadcopter in the area.
               Anderson said the Quadcopter was flying towards the east and
               apparently went out of range of the remote control. Anderson
               said he saw the Quadcopter continue to travel in an easterly
               direction. Anderson went to the east side of the Valley Rd.
               playfields and spoke to subjects playing soccer. The soccer
               players pointed towards the east/ southeast and said they saw
               the Quadcopter continue in that direction. Anderson went along
               the suspected route, but could not locate the Quadcopter.
               Anderson said when he walked to the Nez Perce apartment parking
               lot and noticed two subjects working on landscaping. Anderson
               asked them if they saw the Quadcopter and both said they did
               not. Over the course of the following week Anderson, along with
               many other people scoured the area. Anderson had another
               subject fly their Quadcopter with a camera attached and
               photographed the area, but still could not locate the
               Quadcopter. Anderson believes the Quadcopter would have
               eventually landed in the area of the Nez Perce apartments and
               feels that someone found it and took it. Anderson said he got a
               "strange vib" from one of the landscapers working. Anderson
               provided me with the description and prices of all the
               components of the setup. I completed and NCIC form for the
               GoPro and emailed it to records to be entered and scanned it to
               the case. At this time there are no suspects or leads. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 19th day of June, 2014, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer
