               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On June 1, 2014 at about 0707 hours I
               was dispatched to a lockout at the CUB. I responded to the main
               entry where I contacted Kelly M. Newell (06/12/73). Newell is
               the WSU Online Outreach & Program Director. She was involved
               with the Imagine Tomorrow event that was held at the CUB
               yesterday. Newell was with an unidentified high school teacher
               from Ballard, WA. The high school teacher had forgotten his bag
               in the CUB yesterday. He was leaving with his school this
               morning by 0830. He was in need of the bag because it had
               student's papers in it that he needed to grade. Newell asked if
               we could go inside and look under the chair he was sitting in
               for the bag. I escorted them into the CUB and we checked the
               areas where the Imagine Tomorrow event took place. We were not
               able to locate the bag. Newell told the high school teacher
               that she will find the bag and FedEx it back to him on Monday.
               They both thanked me for my assistance. I escorted them out of
               the building. Assistance provided, no further investigation. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 1st day of June, 2014, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer

               UNIVERSITY POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W2160 SYNOPSIS: I was

               WSU STUDENT: ____YES ____NO OTHER UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 06-
               01-2014 at about 0913 hrs I was dispatched to a request for a
               building lockout at Chemical Storage, located at 210 SE Dairy
               Road. I arrived on scene and contacted a WSU Facilities
               Operations employee, who stated that he needed to get inside
               the building to read the meter. The Chemical Storage building
               is alarmed, and I determined that Dispatch did not have the
               code to deactivate and/or reset the alarm. The reading of the
               meter was not emergent, and I decided that it was not necessary
               to summon a responsible party to the scene just to read a
               meter. I told the Facilities Operations employee to reschedule
               the reading of the meter for Monday during business hours when
               the building would be open, which he agree to do. I cleared the
               scene. No further action at this time. Olmstead/339 I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.
