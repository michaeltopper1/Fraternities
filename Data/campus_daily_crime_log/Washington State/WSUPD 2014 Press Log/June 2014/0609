               NARRATIVE: On June 9, 2014 at about 1434 hours I was dispatched
               to a vehicle prowl. The complainant/victim, Jessica L. Pierce
               Rohleder (09/26/94), requested telephone contact. I called her
               as requested. She began the conversation with "It might be my
               fault because I left the door unlocked." Pierce Rohleder told
               me she parked her vehicle, DSB655/AK, in the Blue 1 lot near
               Roger Orton Playfield. She was not very specific on where it
               was parked other than that general location. The vehicle was
               parked at about 0800 hours on June 9, 2014. She discovered
               items missing from the car at about 1300 hours that same date.
               As she initially stated the vehicle was unlocked. Pierce
               Rohleder said there was no damage to the vehicle. An empty gray
               backpack was taken from an unknown location inside the car. It
               is valued at $45.00. A $100.00 Safeway gift card was also taken
               from an unknown location inside the car. I asked her to be more
               specific on a possible location. Pierce Rohleder replied "It
               was like 8 AM and that is early for a college student." She
               followed that statement with a laugh. Pierce Rohleder finished
               the conversation by telling me this is the second time in about
               two (2) weeks that her vehicle has been broken into. Pullman
               Police took vehicle prowl report on May 18, 2014. She has no
               idea who may be responsible for the vehicle prowls or if they
               are related. There are no suspects, witnesses, or leads at this
               time. No further investigation. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 9th day of
               June, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               06/09/14 at approximately 1813 hours, I was driving northbound
               on Stadium Way when I saw a gold colored Ford sedan heading
               westbound on North Fairway. I watched as the Ford slowed
               slightly for the stop sign at the intersection of North Fairway
               and Stadium Way before it turned right onto Stadium Way in
               front of me. The driver only slowed slightly and never came to
               a full stop at the stop sign. I initiated a traffic stop and
               the vehicle came to a stop at Orchard Drive and Gaines Road. I
               contacted the driver, Anthony L.J. Bendorf 01/12/93, identified
               myself, informed Bendorf I was recording and asked him if he
               knew why I had stopped him. Bendorf said, "yeah I did not come
               to a complete stop." Bendorf said he did not think twice about
               stopping. Bendorf provided his WADL and vehicle registration.
               Bendorf stated he did not have his current insurance card with
               him. I returned to my patrol car and ran Bendorf through
               dispatch. Dispatch stated Bendorf's driver's license was
               suspended thought Washington in the 3rd degree. I returned to
               Bendorf and asked him to speak with me outside the car. Once
               outside I asked Bendorf if had received any citations recently.
               Bendorf said he received a no proof of insurance citation a
               while ago and his license was suspended because he could not
               pay the ticket. I asked Bendorf if he had taken care of his
               suspended license. Bendorf said no, he has been busy with
               moving to Pullman. Bendorf also said, "I know it's stupid, I
               shouldn't be driving." I told Bendorf that he was under arrest
               for driving on a suspended license. Bendorf was handcuffed
               (D/L) and searched incident to arrest. No weapons or items of
               evidentiary value were found. I read Bendorf his Miranda Rights
               of my department issued card. Bendorf stated he understood his
               rights and having them in mind still wished to speak to me. I
               transported Bendorf to the Pullman Holding Facility where he
               was fingerprinted and photographed. I issued Bendorf Sector
               citation 4Z0591790 for RCW 46.20.342.1C DWLS 3rd Degree. I
               explained the citation to Bendorf and provided him with his
               copy. Bendorf was released from custody. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
