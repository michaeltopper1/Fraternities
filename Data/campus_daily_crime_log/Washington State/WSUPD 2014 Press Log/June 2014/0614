               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 061414 at approximately 1800 hours I
               heard Pullman PD being dispatched to: "RP is reporting a
               possible drunk driver. Last seen leaving the parking lot
               towards "The Man Shop". States the attendant told him to go up
               over Stadium Way through Campus to Get there. Believes he is
               intoxicated. Slurred speech and not all there. Sort of lost.
               Plate: APW5909 Vehicle: Silver Ford Focus" I left the station
               and the vehicle drove by at Wilson and Stadium Way. I got
               behind the vehicle and it turned into the CUE parking lot. The
               vehicle parked and I pulled off to the side several car lengths
               away so as not to obstruct the vehicle at all. My emergency
               lights were not activated. I got out of my vehicle and
               approached the Ford Focus. William J. Modene (081679) exited
               his vehicle and appeared to be shaking. I requested another
               unit. Ofc. Kirshner arrived shortly after. Modene said he
               normally shakes but did not have a medical condition. Modene
               told me he was lost. He was trying to find his hotel. I could
               smell the odor of intoxicants on his breath and his eyes were
               watery. Modene seemed to have labored or slurred speech. I
               asked him for his driver's license and he provided it. He
               intially denied drinking that day. I asked if he would be
               willing to provide some voluntary field sobriety tests and he
               said something to the effect of "you guys got me, I'm not going
               to lie to you". I confirmed he did not want to do the tests and
               he reaffirmed that we had "got" him. I asked if he would be
               willing to provide a voluntary sample for my PBT and he agreed
               to. I stated it was voluntary and did not replace the
               evidentiary breath test. He provided the sample stating "I know
               I'm going to fail it". He provided a sample of .243 at 1807
               hours. I confirmed he did not want to perform SFST's and placed
               him under arrest for DUI. I read him Miranda and he stated he
               understood he rights. I let him smoke a cigarette. He was
               placed in handcuffs and placed in the back of my patrol car. He
               was informed he was being recorded. Ofc. Kirshner stayed on
               scene for the tow and later brought the tow form and Morene's
               wallet and phone to PPD. Once we arrived at PPD, Ofc. Gordon
               had already begun processing a separate DUI case so I began our
               process in the interview room. At 1827 hours I read Modene his

               constitutional rights and he signed the form. At 1828 hours I
               checked Modene's mouth and found no foreign substances. At 1830
               hours I read him the implied consent warning for breath. I
               asked him if was willing to provide 2 breath samples and he
               said he would. He did not request counsel. Modene did complete
               the DUI interview. In the interview he stated he could not
               remember how much he had drank that day. He thought he had
               started drinking at 0800 and stopped drinking about 15 minutes
               before I contacted him. Modene had stated he feels he has a
               "drinking problem". He affirmed that his ability to drive was
               affected by his alcohol consumption. Modene was unsure of what
               bar he had been drinking at but had started out at his hotel
               room. While waiting for Ofc. Gordon to finish, I went over the
               Driver's Hearing Request form with Modene. Ofc. Gordon then
               informed me that the BAC was malfunctioning and we all would
               need to go to Colfax. I transported Modene to the County Jail
               to utilize their BAC. At 1928 hours I checked Modene's mouth
               and found no foreign substances. During the 15 minute
               observation period, I observed Modene the entire time and he
               did not vomit, eat, smoke, drink, or place anything in his
               mouth. I checked that the breath tube was warm to the touch,
               the instrument was on, the antenna was attached, and the sim
               temperature was within 34c +/- .3c. At 1950 hours he provided
               his first sample and a reading of .215 was recorded. At 1953
               hours Modene provided his second sample and a reading of .227
               was recorded. When the test document was printed I signed and
               explained the results to Modene. Modene had told me that he had
               a previous DUI in Alaska. He thought it had taken place in 2004
               or 2005. I had requested a triple I be run via dispatch but
               ACCESS was down. We had checked a couple times with no results.
               I consulted Ofc. Kirshner who was acting OIC. He agreed that
               without definitive evidence of the previous DUI in the last 10
               years I should not book Modene into jail. While returning to
               PPD we encountered a vehicle that was varying it's speed from
               50 mph to 64 mph. When it turned onto the north bypass from 195
               south, it stopped, then continued. At this time it appeared as
               if a child's car seat had overturned. The vehicle continued to
               have varying speeds. I requested a Pullman PD unit respond.
               Ofc. Gordon said he was nearby and asked me to stop the vehicle
               and I did. Ofc. Gordon arrived and I informed him of what I
               saw. And he took over the stop. The driver was Shouhai Li
               (051579) and the vehicle was a blue Mustang (WA/APY4327). I
               then continued to PPD where I explained to Modene his Notice Of
               Hearing/Conditions of Release. I made a copy for my case. I
               also explained his tow form to him. I then transported Modene
               to the Quality Inn where I issued him Sector Citation 4Z0321328
               for DUI. He was released with all of his property and
               paperwork. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 14th day of June of 2014, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 06-14-14, Marlon O. Lopez Cabrera
               (12-10-94) called Whitcom stating he had his backpack stolen
               from the Valley/Orchard play fields. He said he had driven to
               the play fields at approximately 1800 hours on 06-14-14. He
               parked his vehicle in the parking lot and placed his keys in
               his backpack and began playing soccer. When he finished playing
               soccer he realized his backpack was not where he had left it
               and called Whitcom. Lopez Cabrera described his backpack as
               being bright yellow in color, having black, string straps, and
               having a black skull and cross bones print on the yellow
               portion of the backpack. He said he placed the backpack on the
               ground on the West side of the East soccer field near the goal
               while he was playing soccer. He described the keys as having
               two car keys and a "Clicker" which unlocked or locked the
               vehicle upon pressing its buttons. I value the key ring at
               approximately $100. I helped Lopez Cabrera look through the
               garbage cans, recycle bins, and bathrooms in the area and we
               were unable to locate the backpack. I gave Lopez Cabrera a
               business card with a Police Case Number on it and asked him to
               contact me if he located the backpack and/or keys. No suspects

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 06/15/14 at approximately 0205 hours
               I was traveling north on NE Stadium Way near Lake St. I saw the
               defendant turn onto Stadium Way northbound from Valley Rd. As
               the vehicle was traveling north on Stadium Way I noticed when
               it applied the brakes, the center brake light did not
               illuminate when the other brake lights did. I was not able to
               catch up to the vehicle until the area of Grand Ave and Tesoro.
               As the vehicle approached Whitman St. it put on its left turn
               signal and again the brakes were applied. I again noticed the
               center brake light did not illuminate. I activated my emergency
               lights and VieVu camear and stopped the vehicle on Whitman near
               Grand Ave. As the vehicle pulled over I noticed the back seat
               passenger was laying down, as she got up as the vehicle was
               stopping. I could see the passenger was not wearing her
               seatbelt. Ofc. Gordon arrived on scene at this time. I
               contacted the driver and advised him the reason for the stop
               and that it was being recorded. I asked the driver for his
               license, registration, and proof of insurance. I was provided
               with the registration. The driver verbally identified himself
               as Jason W. Allen 05/07/90. I asked Allen if his license was
               through Washington and he said it was. I asked Allen if it was
               valid and he said it was. Ofc. Gordon also told me that the
               back passenger was not wearing her seatbelt. I asked her for
               her ID, which she provided identifying her as Rebekah J.
               Tegtmeier 10/06/94. I noticed Tegtmeier's movements were slow
               and deliberate and she had difficulty retrieving her ID. While
               standing at the car I could smell the strong odor of
               intoxicants coming from the car. I asked Allen how much he had
               to drink and he said none. I asked Allen if I could check his
               eyes and he said I could. I attempted to administer an HGN
               test, but due to Allens' size I could not get him into the
               proper testing position. I returned to my vehicle and ran both
               subjects through Whitcom. Whitcom radioed that Tegtmeimer was
               clear and Allen had no return. I returned to Allen's vehicle
               and asked if he would perform some field sobriety tests. Allen
               said he would. I had Allen exit his vehicle and administered
               the tests in the parking lot near the train depot. Before

               starting the tests I had Allen confirm his information, which
               he did. I again ran Allen's information, again receiving no
               return. At the end of my tests it was my opinion that Allen was
               not impaired by alcohol. I explained to Allen that I still
               needed to get his information because his name was not Jason
               Allen. I asked Allen what his SSN was and he said he did not
               know. I told Allen that was because he was lying to me. I asked
               Allen what the address on his license was and he said he just
               moved from Las Vegas. I asked Allen if he had a Nevada driver's
               license and he said he did and was getting it transferred to
               Washington. I ran Allen's information through Nevada and still
               received no return. While speaking with Allen he was acting
               very nervous and I noticed at times he was tugging at his
               clothing, moving around, and was fidgeting with his hands as
               well. These actions appeared as pre-attack indicators to me. I
               explained to Allen that in the state of Washington not having a
               valid license and no identification was a criminal offense. I
               told Allen I was detaining him until I could confirm his
               identity and driving status. I handcuffed (D/L) Allen and again
               told him he was not under arrest, but was being detained. I
               read Allen his Miranda Rights, which he said he understood and
               would answer my questions. I placed Allen in the back seat of
               my patrol car. The front passenger exited the vehicle and spoke
               with Ofc. Boyd (who arrived on scene during the tests). The
               front passenger told Ofc. Boyd that Allen was her brother and
               confirmed the same information he had provided me. I spoke with
               the front passenger, who verbally identified herself as Alyssa
               R. Allen 11/07/93. I explained to Alyssa that at this time I
               was going to arrest Allen for NVOL w/out ID, since I was
               receiving no valid driver's return and he did not have his ID.
               I told Alyssa I would be transporting Allen to Pullman PD,
               where he could possibly be released from later. I returned to
               my patrol car and attempted to find any information using LinX,
               but was not successful. I returned to Alyssa and asked her if
               there was a sober driver for the vehicle. Alyssa said she was
               sober, but did not know how to drive a manual car. I told
               Alyssa that Tegtmeier had too much to drink to drive. I offered
               to have an officer park the car in the nearby parking lot.
               Alyssa said she would learn how to drive a manual. I told her
               she was free to go and Tegtmeier was given her ID. I returned
               to my vehicle and advised Allen he was under arrest for NVOL
               w/out ID. I transported Allen to Pullman PD. Upon arrival at
               Pullman PD I placed Allen in a holding cell. I began to attempt
               to find Allen's identity through DAPS searching similar names
               and by the address Alyssa provided me as her home address, but
               was not successful. I heard Ofc. Gordon on the radio advise
               that he was contacting Alyssa and Tegtmeier, who had drove to
               the area of the Pullman PD. Ofc. Gordon advised me that Alyssa
               was advising him now that her last name was Banks. I remembered
               seeing a tattoo on Allen's right arm that said "Banks". I
               attempted to run Allen's information with the last name of
               Banks, but still got no return. I ran Alyssa's information with
               a last name of Banks and got a return with an address in Walla
               Walla. Alyssa came into Pullman PD and spoke with the records
               personal and told her she was there to pick up Jeffrey. At this

               time I knew both subjects were lying about his identity. I
               asked the records personal to get Jeffrey's full information
               from Alyssa. This time Alyssa said she made a mistake as her
               other brother's name is Jeffrey and provided a the initial name
               of Jason, but with a date of birth of 05/05/90. I asked Allen
               what his middle name was and he said Wayne. I asked Alyssa what
               Allen's middle name was and she said Wesley. I decided to call
               Walla Walla dispatch (WESCOM) and spoke with Kris Kerr. I gave
               Kerr all of the different names I was provided. Kerr was able
               to locate a booking photo for a subject named Adam W. Banks
               05/05/90. Kerr told me the booking photo showed two tattoos,
               one on his left arm that said "Family" and one on his right arm
               that said "Banks". Kerr also told me that Banks has two
               warrants from Walla Walla (one from county one from city) and
               that he was suspended. I had Whitcom confirm all of this
               information, which they did, including the warrants. I returned
               to Banks and asked him if he was sure his last name was not
               Banks. At this time he told me he did not want to talk to me
               anymore. I told Banks he was going to be booked into jail for
               his 2 warrants, DWLS 3rd, and making a false statement. I spoke
               with Alyssa and asked her what her brother's first name was.
               Alyssa said, "He told you Jason." I asked Alyssa how long she
               knew her brother. Alyssa said 4 years. I asked Alyssa if he was
               her "blood brother" and she said no. I told Alyssa that she
               knew his first name was Adam. I asked her why she did not tell
               me that his name was Adam. Alyssa began to cry and said she did
               not want to get him in trouble. I told Alyssa that she is lucky
               I am not arresting her for providing false information. I told
               Alyssa that Banks would be booked into jail and transported to
               Walla Walla on Wednesday. Kerr emailed me photos of Banks and
               the tattoos. I confirmed that indeed the subject I had in
               custody was Banks. Ofc. Boyd transported Banks to Whitman
               County jail and read him the warrants. Banks was also booked on
               his charges. Charges forwarded. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 15th day of
               June, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.
