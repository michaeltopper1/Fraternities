               ____NO OTHER UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On June 7, 2014 at about
               1249 hours Pullman Fire and WSU Police were dispatched to a
               fire alarm activation at Southside Dining. Officer Welter and I
               responded to the building. I was contacted by Southside Dining
               staff upon my arrival. I was told that the fire suppression
               system activated near the pizza oven. They said there was no
               known fire emergency. Staff was in the process of making
               pizzas. The pizza oven was on, warming up. No food had been
               cooked, just prep work. The staff did not report seeing any
               smoke or flames. Pullman Fire personnel and I discovered the
               Ansul R-102 wet chemical fire suppression system had activated
               at two cooking stations near the pizza oven. The green colored
               wet chemical agent was covering the cooking burners, floor, and
               surrounding areas. Each cooking station has two (2) R102
               sprinkler heads that activated. A total of four (4) heads
               activated. The system was serviced by General Fire in May 2014
               according to the tags affixed to it. According to Ansul, the R-
               102 Restaurant Fire Suppression System is an automatic pre-
               engineered, fire suppression system designed to protect areas
               associated with ventilating equipment including hoods, ducts,
               plenums and filters. We found a fusible link that had separated
               over the pizza oven causing the system to activate. The link is
               designed to melt at a set temperature. It is unknown why the
               link activated. The pizza oven has an exhaust fan which
               automatically turns on when the oven is on. We were unable to
               verify if the fan was working or not. WSU Life Safety and
               Facilities Operations Maintenance responded to the scene at the
               request of Pullman Fire. WSU Life Safety was going to contact
               General Fire to re certify the system. This section of the
               Dining Center can't be used until the system has been
               recharged. There was no damage. No further investigation. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 7th day of June, 2014, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer
