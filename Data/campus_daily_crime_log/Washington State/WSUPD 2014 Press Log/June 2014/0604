               reported that a few medical supplies were taken from a staff
               break room of WSU Health and Wellness on the first floor of the
               Washington Building. NAME/DOB: CITE/SECTOR#: OFFENSE:

               ____NO OTHER UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 060414, at about
               1120hrs, I contacted Donna Harsh, the Administrative Manager of
               WSU Health and Wellness, about several medical supplies that
               had been taken from a first floor break room. On May 9, they
               received 2 units of Trichloracetic Acid (a medication which is
               used to remove warts) worth $35.44. The supplies were placed in
               the first floor break room until it was moved into the locked
               supply room (which is adjacent to the break room). The door to
               the supply room is only accessible by going through the break
               room. The break room is not marked with a room number but is
               located in the area of suites labeled 118, but closest to room
               118C. The wart medication was noticed missing on May 15th. An
               email was sent out to all of the Health and Wellness employees
               to see if anyone had moved the items or had seen anything
               unusual. Then on May 16 some finger splints were delivered and
               placed in the break room again. The nurse who was supposed to
               take the supplies and lock them up was on annual leave. The
               splints were initally documented as being received but placed
               in the break room. There were about 42 finger splints (about
               $48.72). Those were noticed missing on May 21st. On June 2nd,
               Health and Wellness received a free sample of Medihoney paste
               (wound care paste)and it was seen in the break room on June 3rd
               in the afternoon, but could not be located on the morning of
               June 4th around 0800hrs. There are 50 plus WSU Health and
               Wellness employees that have access to the break room and a few
               contracted xray lab employees who actually are employees from
               Pullman Regional Hospital who work in the immediate area as
               well. There also have been some contractors roaming around on
               the southwest side of the floor while they are remodeling that
               area. I talked to a few of the workers and none of them seemed
               to know anything. I also talked to Cindy Bennett, a Registered
               Nurse, that has been asking almost everyone if they have seen
               anything unuasual but has not found anything. I advised them to
               lock everything up as soon as the supplies are delivered so
               that the thefts could be prevented. They will call if any
               additional information becomes available. I certify and declare

               indicated that someone has possibly tampered with the freezer

               ____NO OTHER UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 060414 at about 1445hrs,
               Trent Amonett called to report that someone had changed the
               temperature setting on a freezer belonging to the WSU Chemistry
               Department. The freezer is located by room 477. He indicated
               that he received and email from Professor Cliff Berkman saying
               that on Monday night (060214) at about 1700hrs, he left and
               noticed that temperature setting on the freezer was -80 degrees
               celsius. When Berkman arrived on Tuesday morning his students
               noticed the freezer setting was set to 1 degree celsius.
               Berkman did not think that the temperature in the freezer rose
               to above zero but was concerned about the research projects and
               the potentially them being compromised. I went to Fulmer Hall
               and made contact with Amonett and then went to the fourth floor
               to room 477. I had to leave a card for Berkman to contact me
               but I noticed the chest freezer was right outside his office
               (see picture). Sgt Jacobson took a report (14-W2133) on May 29
               of subjects turn off or opening instruments. I will have
               dayshift make some rounds through Fulmer Hall for the next
               several days. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this ____ day of _____________,

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 06/05/14 at approximately 0350 hours
               I was driving through the CUE parking garage between the 1st
               and 2nd floor. When I entered the garage no one was in the
               structure. As I turned around to come down from the 2nd floor I
               slowed and noticed a subject on a bicycle coming up from the
               1st floor. The subject appeared to be driving straight towards
               two vehicles parked in the garage. When the subject saw me he
               quickly turned around and left quickly. As I turned to the 1st
               floor the subject was already gone. As I exited the garage I
               saw the subject quickly pedaling across Stadium Way towards the
               west side of McCoy. The subject continued between McCoy and
               Wegner Hall. I drove to the south side of Wegner Hall and saw
               the subject heading towards me. I parked my car (leaving
               approximately a vehicle's width between me and the curb, and
               without activating my emergency lights) and exited my vehicle.
               I activated my VieVu camera. I asked the subject if he had a
               second to talk and he stopped his bike and started to talk with
               me. I asked him what he was doing and he said he was out for a
               bike ride. I asked if he was a student and he said no, but he
               lived in Pullman. Based upon my training and experience as a
               DRE it appeared the subject was under the influence of a CNS
               Stimulant. I asked the subject if he had any ID and he said he
               did not. He told me he had his wallet. I asked if he had
               anything in his wallet with his name on it and he said he did.
               He removed an EBT card and handed it to me. I saw the name
               David Jennings and asked Whitcom to run his name locally. I
               gave his card back and asked him about the bike he was riding.
               Jennings told me he bought it from his friend and I made small
               talk about the bike. I learned that Jennings bought the bike
               from Fred for $200 and a flat screen TV (worth $200). Whitcom
               radioed that Jennings had a warrant from Colfax. I told
               Jennings there was a warrant for his arrest. I handcuffed (D/L)
               Jennings and told him he was not under arrest, but was being
               detained. I removed a knife from Jennings pocket and placed it
               on the curb. Whitcom confirmed the warrant and I told Jennings
               he was under arrest and advised him of his right to counsel. I
               told Jennings he was being audio and video recorded. I walked
               Jennings to my vehicle and searched him incident to arrest. In

               Jennings left jacket pocket I located a pair of nippers and a
               cell phone case. In the cell phone case was a cell phone and a
               pipe that I recognized as a meth pipe. Next to the pipe was a
               small baggie that contained a small amount of crystals that I
               recognized to be methamphetamine. In Jennings right jacket
               pocket was a folding multi tool. I found no other weapons or
               items of evidence. Ofc. Anderson, Ofc. Stewart, and Ofc.
               Lambley arrived on scene around this time. I placed Jennings in
               the back of my patrol car and read him his Miranda Rights,
               which he said he understood. Ofc. Anderson ran the serial
               number on the bike and it returned not stolen. I asked Jennings
               if he wanted me to leave the bike where it was or store it at
               WSUPD and he asked that I store it. I turned off my recording
               at this time. I came back to my car and turned my VieVu on and
               asked if he remembered the rights I read to him and he said he
               did. I asked Jennings if he would answer my questions and he
               said he would. I asked Jennings if he would be surprised if the
               bike returned stolen and he said he would. Jennings told me he
               bought the bike from a guy named Fred who worked at Basilios. I
               asked Jennings if he knew where Fred got the bike and he said
               he bought it from a friend. I told Jennings it seemed kind of
               odd. Jennings said he did not think it was. I turned off my
               recording at this time. I transported Jennings to Whitman
               County Jail and booked him on the warrant. I read the warrant
               to Jennings and scanned it to the case. I forgot to return
               Jennings' knife. I asked the jail staff to advise Jennings his
               knife would be with his bike. I retrieved the knife and put it
               with Jennings bike in the vehicle bay. Further investigation of
               the drugs on case 14-W2197. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 5th day of June,
               2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               06/05/14 at approximately 0350 hours I was driving through the
               CUE parking garage between the 1st and 2nd floor. When I
               entered the garage no one was in the structure. As I turned
               around to come down from the 2nd floor I slowed and noticed a
               subject on a bicycle coming up from the 1st floor. The subject
               appeared to be driving straight towards two vehicles parked in
               the garage. When the subject saw me he quickly turned around
               and left quickly. As I turned to the 1st floor the subject was
               already gone. As I exited the garage I saw the subject quickly
               pedaling across Stadium Way towards the west side of McCoy. The
               subject continued between McCoy and Wegner Hall. I drove to the
               south side of Wegner Hall and saw the subject heading towards
               me. I parked my car (leaving approximately a vehicle's width
               between me and the curb, and without activating my emergency
               lights) and exited my vehicle. I activated my VieVu camera. I
               asked the subject if he had a second to talk and he stopped his
               bike and started to talk with me. I asked him what he was doing
               and he said he was out for a bike ride. I asked if he was a
               student and he said no, but he lived in Pullman. Based upon my
               training and experience as a DRE it appeared the subject was
               under the influence of a CNS Stimulant. I asked the subject if
               he had any ID and he said he did not. He told me he had his
               wallet. I asked if he had anything in his wallet with his name
               on it and he said he did. He removed an EBT card and handed it
               to me. I saw the name David Jennings and asked Whitcom to run
               his name locally. I gave his card back and asked him about the

               under arrest, but was being detained. I removed a knife from
               Jennings pocket and placed it on the curb. Whitcom confirmed
               the warrant and I told Jennings he was under arrest and advised

               logged it into evidence, with the baggy to be sent to the lab
               for testing. Charges to be forwarded pending lab results. I
