               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On June 9, 2014 at about 0635 hours WSU
               Police were toned out to a burglary alarm at the WSU Alumni
               Center. Officer Stewart and I responded to the building.
               Officer Stewart contacted a WSU Facilities Operations employee
               who had set off the alarm. The worker thought the building was
               open. She pulled on the east entry door handle and the door
               opened. The door had been locked but it was not completely shut
               allowing the door to open when pulled on. We searched the
               building, had Whitcom contact a responsible, reset and secured
               the building. The Facility Operations worker was told to come
               back when the building was officially opened at about 0800
               hours. No further investigation. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 9th day of
