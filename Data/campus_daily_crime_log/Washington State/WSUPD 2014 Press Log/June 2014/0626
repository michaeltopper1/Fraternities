               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W2394 SYNOPSIS: Flor A. Araujo
               (070596) had her phone taken from her room. Unable to track it.

               NARRATIVE: On 062614 at 1648 hours I was dispatched to the
               report of a stolen phone from a room in Regents. I responded to
               Bohler Gym where the victim, Flor A. Araujo (070596), was
               waiting with WSU Women's Basketball Assistant Coach Ashley T.
               Grover (052987). In talking with the two I learned that Araujo
               had been on campus since 062414 and living in Regents Hall. She
               was attending a basketball camp with 79 other basketball
               players. They were all lodged in Regents. Camp had ended and
               everyone else had left. Araujo discovered at approximately 1300
               that her phone and charger (Iphone 5s/Gold) had been taken. She
               had last seen it at 0900 hours. I asked about her roommate and
               Grover informed me that the roommate was a female by the name
               of Darion. Grover had called Darion's coach, a Vanessa
               McClendon (253-355-6497), of NW Magic Basketball. Grover and
               Araujo did not have reason to suspect anyone on the team but
               thougth to check. McLendon and her team had left early and were
               already on the road. When Grover asked about the phone,
               McLendon reportedly pulled over and searched Darion's
               belongings. She did not find the phone. I later placed a call
               to McLendon but have not heard anything back. Araujo confirmed
               that she had left her door open while leaving the phone. Araujo
               did not have an tracking applications for the phone and had not
               called it. I called it and it appeared to have been turned off.
               I explained to Araujo that she should report her phone stolen
               to her carrier (AT&T) and request any recent activity. I gave
               her the case number and my contact information. I remained on
               scene to speak with Araujo's brother who was picking her up as
               Araujo was a juvenile. Tony Gonzales (071781) arrived and I
               explained the situation to him and requested any information
               they may get. I cleared. I later spoke with Vanessa D.
               McClendon (033071). She confirmed what Grover had told and
               added that she had searched Darion's "person" and did not find
               the phone. She has known Darion for at least 6 years and did
               not suspect her to be the culprit. Case closed pending any
               leads. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the
               laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 26th day of June, 2014, in Pullman,

               NARRATIVE: On 062614 at approximately 1750 hours I was
               dispatched to the report of an angry woman lying partially in
               the roadway on College Ave. Sgt. Jacobson responded as well and
               arrived before me. We found Janette M. Lorton (100571) lying on
               the curb on Tacoma St. She said she suffered from numerous
               ailments and had an allergic reaction to something she had been
               given at the hospital. She said she had been unable to move.
               Sgt. Jacobson requested medics respond. Medics arrived and she
               informed them she had recently had a heart attack and had
               recently smoked marijuana. They asked if she wanted to go to
               the hospital and she said yes. As the medics loaded her on a
               gurney a vehicle drove by. The male driver had his windows down
               and was singing along to Wham!'s "Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go".
               His music and singing was loud enough for us to hear and most
               of us chuckled. I then heard Lorton say "Fag". I am referring
               this to OEO. Medics did not need further assistance and we
               cleared. Nothing follows. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 26th day of June,

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 06/26/14 at approximately 2250 hours
               I was on foot patrol on the southwest side of the Stephenson
               Complex. As I came around the corner to the west side of the
               dining area I could hear the noise of a lighter "flicking". I
               could see a subject sitting near the top of the stairs (at the
               furthest staircase south). I activated my VieVu camera. As I
               turned to walk up the stairs I noticed the subject was not
               visible and I could hear the sound of two items dropping onto
               the ground along the building. As I got to the top of the
               stairs I saw a subject standing close to the glass doors. I
               told the subject that I would just go pick up what he dropped
               and he said, "What the water bottle?" I could see a small
               amount of what I recognized to be marijuana (based upon my
               training and experience) on the landing at the top of the
               stairs, as well as a small amount on his left pant leg near his
               knee. I asked the subject if he had his ID and he said no. The
               subject picked up his backpack and put it on as if he was
               leaving and I told him to have a seat, which he did. I asked
               the subject what his first name was and he said John. I asked
               what the full name on his license was and he said he did not
               have a license. I asked the subject how old he was and he said
               17. I asked what he was doing at that location and he said he
               was just walking over there. I asked him if he was here for
               Alive and he said no and that he lived "over there" and pointed
               towards the Latah St. area. I asked him what his address was
               and he told me that he was lying. He then said "I fucked up". I
               told him I knew he was smoking and asked if that was what he
               dropped. He said it was just a little "shake" in the container
               he dropped. The subject verbally identified himself as Joshua
               J. Mason 10/26/95. Ofc. Petlovany arrived on scene and located
               a prescription bottle with a small amount of marijuana flecks
               inside, which he brought to me. Mason admitted to smoking
               marijuana from the water bottle. Mason was very apologetic and
               polite with me. I gave the water bottle and prescription bottle
               to Mason and told him to throw it away. I told Mason he would
               be contacted by Student Conduct about the incident, but I would
               not be pursuing criminal charges. I returned to WSUPD and
               downloaded the video to the computer. I sent an email to Amanda
