               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 06/20/14 at approximately 1834 hours
               I was dispatched to the Bustad Hall parking lot where Park's
               parked car was hit. Park said he parked his car at
               approximately 1000 hours and returned to his car at
               approximately 1830 hours. When Park looked at his vehicle he
               noticed damage to his driver side rear bumper. I looked at the
               bumper and noticed a very large dent just rear of the fuel door
               and continued to the tail light. Also the bumper had been
               cracked from the tail light section to the face of the bumper.
               There was white paint transfer on the rear quarter panel and
               bumper. It appears that someone parked next to Park reversed
               and most likely scraped the passenger side front corner of
               their car against Park's parked car. The estimated value of
               damage is $500 dollars. I asked Park if he remembered what kind
               of car was parked next to him. Park said he remembered a larger
               white vehicle. I asked if it was large like a SUV. Park said he
               could not remember the size all he remembered was it was white.
               I photographed the damage to Park's car. The photos were
               uploaded to the files folder in Spillman. I provided Park with
               my business card and his case number. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 20th day of June, 2014, in Pullman,
