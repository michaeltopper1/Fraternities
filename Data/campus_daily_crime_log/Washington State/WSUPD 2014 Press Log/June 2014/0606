               06/06/14 at approximately 1818 hours, I was dispatched to a
               weapons offense in the area of Orton Hall. Dispatch stated RA's
               saw two males in the area with an airsoft gun. There were not
               further details at the time. Upon arrival I saw two Asian males
               talking to a RA in the grassy area east of Orton Hall. As I
               walked up to the males I saw what appeared to be a black sniper
               rifle siting on the ground. The RA, Hannah J. Campbell
               08/24/92, was writing down the names of the two males. Before I
               could ask a question one male, Shuai He 01/21/96, said he just
               had broken the window. He pointed to a 1991 GMC Jimmy parked on
               Olympia Ave. The GMC's back window was shattered. The rifle was
               at the feet of He and I removed it for everybody's safety. I
               asked He what kind of weapon it was and He said it was an
               airsoft gun. The rifle was plastic but had no orange safety tip
               on it. I placed the rifle on my patrol car. I asked He what
               happened and he said he just broke the GMC's window. I asked He
               where he shot the rifle from. He said he was over by the main
               lobby entrance to McEachern Hall and shot towards the Orton
               Playfields. I asked He what he was aiming at. He stated he had
               not aimed but it went off in his hands. I asked how many times
               he pulled the trigger and he said once. I asked what kind of
               BB's he used. He stated they were metal BB's. He stated he had
               just bought the rifle at Walmart about an hour prior to the
               incident. He stated he paid about $150 dollars for the rifle. I
               next spoke to the second male, Chihao Jiang 05/21/96. Jiang
               said He came over to his room, McEachern Hall room 314 and told
               him he had just broken a window. Jiang said he did not witness
               the rifle going off. Ofc. Boyd spoke to the GMC's owner, Hannah
               Marie Mitchell 09/09/85, who had arrived on scene. He was
               wanting to pay for the damage and Mitchell was fine with that.
               Mitchell was provided with her case number. The damage to
               Mitchell's window is estimated at $235.00 Dollars. Due to He's
               willingness to pay for the window and Mitchell acceptance of
               the offer I did not charge He with malicious mischief. Due to

               He's reckless behavior of bringing a loaded airsoft sniper
               rifle outside, pointing it across the roadway, and pulling the
               trigger, I issued He a Sector citation for RCW 9A.36.050
               Reckless Endangerment. I explained the citation to He and
               provided him with his copy. I also told He that his rifle was
               being seized as evidence. Once back at the station, I examined
               the rifle. I found the trigger of the rifle to be very stiff
               and tough to pull back. It is very unlikely that the gun would
               go off accidentally. Due to the stiff trigger it is more likely
               that it was intentionally pulled. The rifle was logged into
               evidence. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 6th day of June,

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 06/06/14 at approximately 2200 hours
               I was dispatched to Steptoe apartments L building for an
               assault that occurred. I responded to apartment L103 and met
               with the apartment coordinator for Terrace Apartments, Edward
               Thomas. Thomas walked me into the apartment and said he met
               with the resident (David) who reported an assault to him.
               Thomas explained that he was going to leave and I could talk
               with David. I met with David (David M. Spadotti) in his
               apartment. I asked David to tell me what happened. David
               explained to me that at approximately 2015 hours he was outside
               his apartment on the south side of it looking at his windows.
               David explained he was curious as to what people could see from
               the roadway. David said that while he was out there a male
               subject who lived adjacent (not directly next to him, but two
               apartments over) looked outside and asked what he was doing.
               David told the subject that he lived at the apartment and was
               just looking at it. David said they continued talking for a
               moment and he walked around the front of the building to talk.
               David said the resident of apartment L201 (Rabee Elhafi) came
               out to the landing area of the building and continued their
               conversation. David said he spoke with Rabee for approximately
               2 minutes. David said he talked with Rabee about being new to
               WSU and just general things. David said Rabee's English was not
               too good and was hard to understand. David said Rabee invited
               him in for coffee and he accepted, going into apartment L201.
               Rabee started asking David if went out to bars and other
               questions about what he did for fun. David said they talked for
               a bit about this and Rabee asked if he went out with males or
               females and he explained he went out with both. David said
               Rabee asked him if residents could have sex in the apartments
               and David explained to Rabee that they are allowed to since
               they are renting the apartments. David re-iterated that Rabee's
               English was poor and he often did not understand what he was
               saying. David said Rabee then asked him if he liked young girls
               and mentioned something about 15 year olds. David told Rabee he
               did not understand what he was talking about and Rabee changed

               the subject back to going out and drinking alcohol. David said
               Rabee asked him again if he drank alcohol and he said he did.
               David said Rabee told him he wanted to show him something and
               walked towards his bedroom. David told me he thought Rabee was
               going to show him alcohol from Libya (David mentioned Rabee was
               from Libya) so he started to follow him. David said when Rabee
               went into his bedroom he (David) stopped because he thought it
               was odd. Rabee told him to come into his bedroom and David told
               him no. David said approximately 10 seconds later, Rabee
               reached out and grabbed his "dick". David said he was shocked
               and slapped Rabee's hand away and pushed him back into his
               bedroom. David said Rabee repeatedly said "Come in" and David
               told him no and left the apartment. David said he began to walk
               toward his apartment, but turned around and walked to the
               apartment coordinator for the Steptoe Apts. David said he
               knocked on the coordinator's door and noticed Rabee left his
               apartment and quickly walked away to the west. David said the
               coordinator was not home so he went back to his own apartment.
               David said he thought about what he should do for approximately
               1 hour and then went to Ed's apartment (Terrace Apt
               coordinator). David said he knew Ed because he helped him move
               in a week prior. David said he told Ed what happened and Ed
               told him to report it to the police. While I was talking with
               David he was very flustered about the situation and worried
               about Rabee trying to come over and retaliate or do something
               else. I explained to David the options of how I could pursue
               the case. David asked that I speak with Rabee and explain that
               what he did was a criminal act and to have no further contact
               with David, or risk arrest for the assault. I told David I
               could do that. I told David I would also follow up with Ed and
               request one of them be relocated. David asked that Rabee be
               relocated because he (David) was just settling into his
               apartment. I told David I could pass that information along. I
               provided David with my business card as well as a DV pamphlet.
               I explained to David that it would be a good idea to petition
               the court for a no contact order. I showed David the steps on
               how to obtain the order. I also explained ATVP's role in
               assisting people as well as options to contact WSU Counseling.
               David explained to me that he was very bothered by the
               encounter and he did not know what he would do if he saw Rabee
               again. I explained to David that if he were to see Rabee in
               passing in the meantime to just ignore him and go the other
               way. I cautioned David on acting out and told him to call the
               police if he felt threatened in any way. David thanked me for
               my time and I left his apartment. I went to Terrace Apt D407
               and spoke with Ed. I explained to Ed what I learned and he said
               that was what David had told him. I asked Ed to begin the
               process of contacting the appropriate people within housing to
               get Rabee relocated and asked that they did that sooner than
               later, due to David's worries. Ed said he had already texted
               his boss. I provided Ed with my business card and case number.
               I went back to Steptoe Apts and knocked on Rabee's door several
               times, but received no answer. I left a note and business card
               on his door requesting him to contact me as soon as possible. I
               called the phone number that Ed provided me for Rabee and left

               a voice mail, again asking him to contact me. At approximately
               0010 hours Whitcom radioed that Rabee was at his apartment for
               contact. I responded back to Rabee's apartment and knocked on
               the door. A male subject, later identified as Rabee answered
               the door and invited me inside. I noticed another male in the
               apartment, identified as Al Tiyb S. Al Khaiyali, sitting on the
               floor. Al Khaiyali explained to me that the number I called was
               his, but he knew Rabee and that Rabee had asked him to come
               over to translate for him. Although Al Khaiyali translated for
               me, I addressed my questions to Rabee. I asked Rabee if he knew
               why I was there and he said he did. I asked Rabee to tell me
               what happened. Rabee said approximately 1/2 hour before sunset
               he noticed David walking behind his apartment. Rabee said he
               asked David what he was doing (thinking he might be a thief)
               and David said he was just looking at his own apartment. Rabee
               said this was the first time he had seen David. Rabee said he
               started a conversation with David and explained that he (Rabee)
               was still learning English. Rabee said they talked for a short
               time and David moved to the front of the building where they
               continued to talk. Rabee said he invited David in for coffee
               and David accepted the offer and they went into the apartment.
               Rabee said that he went into his kitchen and began to make
               coffee. Rabee said David was walking around the apartment while
               he was making the coffee. The apartment is very small with all
               rooms off of the living room area. Rabee said they sat on the
               floor and had the coffee and some chocolates. Rabee said he
               started talking with David about going out and about drinking
               alcohol. Rabee said David invited him to go out with him and
               his friends sometime later. Rabee said he was having a hard
               time understanding David during their conversation. Rabee said
               David walked toward his bedroom and Rabee followed. Rabee said
               David was standing outside his bedroom and Rabee said "We can
               have sex here." (this was the quote from Al Khaiyali). Rabee
               said that David said he did not want to have sex and was only
               looking at how he set up his apartment. I asked Rabee if he
               talked to David about young women, or made any mention about
               ages of women. Rabee said he spoke to David about the women at
               bars and asked about the ages of them. I specifically asked
               Rabee if he asked David about having sex with 15 year old
               girls. Rabee said he did not. Al Khaiyali told me he had
               previously explained to Rabee about the fact it is unacceptable
               to have sex with young women in America. Al Khaiyali told me
               when Rabee moved here he met with him several times and
               explained legal and cultural differences here compared to other
               countries. I asked Rabee if any physical touching occurred. Al
               Khaiyali told me that when they were standing at the room he
               grabbed a hold of David's hand and put it down his own pants on
               his penis. I asked Al Khaiyali to clarify if he grabbed David's
               hand, or if he touched David's penis with his hand. Al Khaiyali
               then told me he was mistaken and that Rabee did indeed touch
               David's penis from the outside of his pants. I understood this
               to mean the touching occurred after Rabee told David they could
               have sex. I asked Rabee what happened next. Rabee said David
               slapped his hand away and told him he did not want that and
               left. Rabee explained that he must have misunderstood David's

               intentions of coming into his apartment. Rabee said that he
               thought because David accepted his coffee offer and willingly
               came into his apartment he had other intentions. Rabee even
               made mention of the shorts that David was wearing (which I
               understood to mean that his outward appearance made Rabee think
               David was possibly gay). Rabee said he now knows that he was
               wrong to make these assumptions. I explained to Rabee that
               David was merely being polite to accept coffee from his
               neighbor. I explained to Rabee that in the future he needs to
               explicitly ask anyone before attempting any physical contact
               with them if that is what his intentions are. I told Rabee that
               what he did was a crime (assault), but that David asked that I
               do not arrest him at this time. I told Rabee that David wants
               no further contact with him whatsoever and that David would
               want to pursue criminal charges if Rabee does contact him.
               Rabee said he understood. I told Rabee that Housing would most
               likely be relocating him and he said he understood and was
               willing to move. I told Rabee that Student Conduct would also
               be getting in touch with him about the event. I provided Rabee
               with my business card and case number. I asked Rabee if he had
               any questions and he said he did not. I thanked Rabee and Al
               Khaiyali for their time and I left. While talking with Rabee he
               appeared embarrassed about his actions and was apologetic. I
               emailed a copy of this narrative to housing. No charges
               requested at this time. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 7th day of June,
               2014, in Pullman, Washington.
