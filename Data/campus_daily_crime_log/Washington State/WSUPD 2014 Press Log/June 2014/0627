               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 14-W2401 SYNOPSIS: Report of an
               individual claiming to be a debt collector calling the WSU Vet
               Teaching Hospital repeatedly. NAME/DOB: CITE/SECTOR#: OFFENSE:

               _____OFC/ ____CNSL SRV Sent?_____OFC/ WSU STUDENT: ____YES
               ____NO OTHER UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 062714 around 1021 hrs I
               was dispatched to a report of telephone harassment at the WSU
               Vet Teaching Hospital. I contacted the reporting party, later
               identified as Douglas J Blake (010265), and was told the
               following. Blake explained an individual who was identifying
               himself as John Smith was repeatedly calling and jamming up the
               main switchboard at the hospital. According to Blake, Smith was
               tying to contact Rachel Fairchild over a supposed debt. When
               Blake transferred Smith to Fairchild he would hang up the phone
               and recall again. I asked Blake for the phone number Smith had
               been calling from and was told it was 786-955-9908. I searched
               the phone number using Bing and found several web pages and
               posts identifying Smith and the phone number as a scam. I
               contacted Smith at the number provided and found him to be
               argumentative. When I asked to speak with his supervisor I was
               told he was unavailable although I could hear someone talking
               to him in the background. I explained who I was and where I
               work before instructing him to no longer call the Vet School.
               Smith told me he would continue to call at which point I
               informed him of the telephone harassment statute. Smith told me
               he didn't care and told me to go ahead and try to find him
               before hanging up on me. At this point I went to the Vet
               Teaching Hospital and spoke with Blake and Fairchild. During
               that period Smith called another 15-20 times, hanging up
               shortly after the line was picked up or I identified myself. I
               instructed Blake to contact Information Technology (IT) and
               request they block the phone number from Smith. While Blake was
               contacting I spoke with Rachel J Fairchild (110254) regarding
               her contact with Smith. She told me she became suspicious over
               the call when Smith had her social security number wrong, as
               well as other information. Fairchild went on to tell me she had
               been the victim of a Scam approximately 2 years ago she had to
               pay off and this caller didn't seem legitimate. I asked if she
               had given Smith any personal information and she told me she
               had not. I provided her with information to contact the
               Internet Criminal Complaint Center and Better Business Bureau
               to file complaints on this. Around this point Blake finished
               speaking with IT and requested they block the phone number

               Smith had been using. I gave him the same information as
               Fairchild and he told me he would do that. Before clearing I
               told him to give me a call if the calls resumed and he told me
               he would. Nothing further at this time. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               27th day of June, 2014, in Pullman, Washington.

               NARRATIVE: On 06/28/14 at approximately 0250 hours Intern Wolff
               and I were parked in the lot on the north side of Vogel Hall
               along NE Johnson Rd., facing north monitoring traffic on
               Stadium Way. I saw the defendant's vehicle traveling north on
               NE Stadium Way past my location. I activated my radar (Veh 41)
               and it displayed a speed reading of 26MPH and it increased to
               29MPH in a 20MPH zone. I caught up with the vehicle and
               activated my emergency lights, stopping the vehicle on Stadium
               Way at Beasley. I activated my VieVu camera. I contacted the
               driver and advised him the stop was being recorded as well as
               the reason for the stop. I asked the driver for his license,
               registration, and proof of insurance. The driver provided me
               with his Idaho license, identifying him as Scott B. Buck
               05/10/94. The driver and passenger continued looking for the
               registration and insurance (which they did not find). I could
               smell the odor of intoxicants emitting from the car. I asked
               Buck where he was going. Buck explained he was going to pick up
               a friend from Pullman and had picked up his passenger from a
               party. I asked Buck how much he had to drink and he said none.
               I asked Buck if I could check his eyes and he said I could. I
               administered an HGN test with Buck seated in the car. I saw a
               lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes and noticed they were
               bloodshot and watery. I asked Buck if he provided a breath
               sample if it would show zeros. Buck said it would, but then
               added that he had a drink hours ago. I asked Buck if he would
               provide a breath sample and he said he would. I had Buck exit
               his vehicle and wait on the sidewalk. I retrieved my PBT and
               explained to Buck that the test was voluntary and did not
               replace the evidentiary breath test. I asked Buck if he had
               anything in his mouth and he said no and opened his mouth,
               which I noticed contained no foreign objects. I checked the PBT
               (FST # 62324) and found it in proper working condition. Buck
               provided a breath sample and while I was waiting for the
               reading I asked Buck if he knew the legal limit in Washington
               for DUI and he said a .08. I told Buck that was correct and
               that for being under 21 it was a .02. Buck gave a breath sample
               of .111 at 0255 hours. I asked Buck if he felt impaired and he
               said no. I asked Buck if he would do some field sobriety tests

               to determine if he was impaired by the alcohol he consumed and
               he said he would. I turned off my front facing emergency
               lights. I administered the field sobriety tests on the level
               and paved sidewalk on the east side of the road. The weather
               was overcast with an approximate temperature of 55 degrees.
               Buck was wearing a sweatshirt, shorts, and canvas boat shoes
               during the tests. Lighting was provided by overhead lights, my
               vehicle spotlight and my flashlight. The first test I
               administered was the HGN. I told Buck to stand with his feet
               together and his arms at his sides. I told Buck to follow the
               tip of my pen with his eyes only with out moving his head. I
               held my pen approximately 12-15 inches in front of Buck's face
               and administered the test. I had Buck remove his glasses for
               the test. I checked Buck's eyes and noticed they tracked
               equally and his pupils were equal in size. I did not see
               resting nystagmus in either eye. I saw a lack of smooth pursuit
               and a distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation in
               both eyes. I saw an onset of nystagmus at approximately 40
               degrees in both eyes. Sgt. Macy arrived on scene around this
               time. The next test I administered was the walk and turn. I
               told Buck to find an imaginary straight line and put his left
               foot on the line. I told Buck to put his right foot in front of
               his left foot touching heel to toe and leave his arms down at
               his sides. I told Buck to stay in that position while I
               explained the test. I told Buck that when I tell him to begin,
               to take nine steps touching heel to toe, watching his feet as
               he walked and count each step out loud. I told Buck that when
               he gets to step nine, to leave his lead foot in place and using
               his rear foot, take small steps around until facing the way he
               came. I told Buck to take nine steps back touching heel to toe
               and counting each step out loud. I told Buck that once he
               started, do not stop. I reminded Buck to count each step out
               loud, keep his arms at his sides, and watch his feet as he
               walked. I demonstrated the test and asked Buck if he understood
               and he said yes. I told Buck to begin at any time. Instruction
               Phase: Buck swayed left to right in the starting position and
               lost his balance and had to move his front foot to the right to
               regain his balance. Buck got back into the starting position.
               First Nine Steps: Buck began the test and took slow steps and
               stopped on step 6. Buck continued the test and missed heel to
               toe between steps 8 & 9 and stepped off the line to the left on
               step 9. Buck competed the turn as directed. Return Nine Steps:
               Buck began his return steps and stepped off line to the left on
               step 8. The next test I administered was the one leg stand. I
               told Buck to stand with his feet together and his arms at his
               sides. I told Buck that when I tell him to begin to raise the
               foot of his choice approximately 6 inches off the ground. I
               told Buck to point his toe forward, look at his foot, and count
               out loud by 1000's until I tell him to stop. I asked Buck if he
               understood, and he said yes. I told Buck to begin at any time.
               Buck raised his right foot and began the test. Buck raised his
               foot approximately 2 inches and I reminded him to raise his
               foot 6 inches. Buck was not looking at his foot and I reminded
               him to do so. Buck swayed left to right during the test. Buck
               counted to 1009 and then started counting over from 1001. Buck

               did this twice. Thirty seconds elapsed on Buck's count of 1006.
               At this time it was my opinion that Buck's ability to drive was
               impaired by alcohol. I told Buck he was under arrest for DUI. I
               handcuffed (D/L) Buck and advised him of his right to counsel.
               I reminded Buck that he was being audio and video recorded. I
               had Intern Wolff search Buck incident to arrest, finding no
               weapons or items of evidence. Intern Wolff placed Buck in the
               back seat of my vehicle. I contacted the passenger (identified
               by Idaho license as Cody T. O'Brien 01/30/92) and explained to
               him the driver was arrested for DUI and the vehicle was getting
               towed. O'Brien gathered the purse (belonging to the vehicle's
               owner who they were picking up) and said he would walk to the
               house they were going to. Sgt. Macy facilitated the tow with
               Autobody Supercenter. I transported Buck to Pullman PD for the
               BAC. Upon arrival we went into Interview Room B. I read Buck
               his Constitutional Rights at 0324 hours, which he said he
               understood and signed both signature blocks. I checked Buck's
               mouth at 0325 hours, finding no foreign substance. I read Buck
               his Implied Consent Warning for Breath at 0327 hours. Buck
               signed that it was read to him. I asked Buck if he would submit
               to a breath test. Buck checked the "yes" box and initialed next
               to it. I asked Buck if he understood the warnings I read to him
               and he said he did. Buck provided a breath sample of .107 at
               0349 hours and a sample of .105 at 0351 hours. The breath test
               was administered in accordance to the methods approved by the
               Washington State Toxicologist pursuant to the Washington
               Administrative Code. I provided Buck with a copy of the
               following documents: Driver's Hearing Request, Notice of
               Hearing/Conditions of Release, the Tow Impound form, and the
               Breath test document. I issued Buck a criminal citation for
               DUI. I explained the citation to Buck and provided him a copy.
               I released Buck from custody. I returned to WSUPD and saved the
               video to the computer. Buck was very polite and cooperative
               during my contact with him. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 28th day of June,
               2014, in Pullman, Washington.
