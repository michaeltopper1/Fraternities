               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On June 21, 2014 at about 1127 hours
               Pullman Fire and WSU Police were dispatched to a trash can fire
               between Webster and Fulmer. Whitcom advised there was an
               language barrier. Officer Welter and I responded to the area.
               As I approached the area from the north I could see a
               noticeable dark column of smoke coming from the area. I was the
               first emergency responder to arrive on scene. I saw a fully
               engulfed dumpster at the Fulmer Hall loading dock. I am
               estimating the dumpster was a 4 yard or greater container. I
               advised Whitcom and request Pullman Fire upgrade their response
               from a non code Bravo response. They did not upgrade and
               responded non code. Pullman Fire personnel quickly extinguished
               the fire. Once the fire was extinguished I investigated for
               origin and cause. The dumpster was full of water and burnt
               garbage debris. I estimate that the dumpster was about two
               thirds of the way full of garbage. There was no lid on the
               dumpster. It is unknown if the dumpster originally had a
               plastic lid that melted. The green exterior paint on the
               dumpster was damaged and flaked off. The garbage inside the
               dumpster is a total loss. I estimated damage to the dumpster at
               $1000.00. I called WSU Fire Marshal Holmes and WSU Police
               Assistant Chief Hansen to advise them of the fire. I also
               called WSU Facilities Operations and provided notification. The
               weather at the time of the fire according to the National
               Weather Service Pullman Regional Airport reporting station was
               about 50 degrees Fahrenheit with calm winds. The sky was clear
               and sunny. It is unknown what caused the fire or where the
               exact origin was. The fire shall be classified as undetermined.
               There are no suspects, witnesses or leads. Digital photos and
               video of the incident were taken. No further investigation. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 21st day of June, 2014, in Pullman,
