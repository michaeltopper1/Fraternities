               May 2014 Detective William Shield contacted Cpl Dawn Daniels
               concerning the possession and distribution of Child
               Pornography. The following is Detective Shield's statement: "On
               Monday, June 16, 2014, I was conducting an online investigation
               on the BitTorrent network for offenders sharing child
               pornography. I directed my investigative focus to a device at
               IP address 134.121.215.206, because it was associated with a
               torrent with the infohash:
               06dd2333f94f76d38316a09b84249e4f92ef061e. This torrent file
               references 1 file, at least one of which was identified as
               being a file of investigative interest to child pornography
               investigations. Using a computer running investigative
               BitTorrent software, I directly connected to the device at IP
               address 134.121.215.206, hereinafter referred to as "Suspect
               Device". The Suspect Device reported it was using BitTorrent
               client software -AZ5300- Vuze 5.3.0.0 On Monday, June 16, 2014,
               between 1100 hrs and 1108 hrs, I successfully completed the
               download of the following 1 file(s) that the device at IP
               address 134.121.215.206 was making available:. The device at IP
               Address 134.121.215.206 was the sole candidate for each
               download, and as such, each file was downloaded directly from
               this IP Address. (PTHC) Notta 2008 g 5yo.mpg
               HBFSZTCU24HQTFX2XZVUHCEUD5VL7JEB In my training and experience
               I know "PTHC" stands for Pre-Teen Hard Core and 5yo stands for
               five years of age. This is a video that is approximately 4
               minutes and 15 seconds in length. The video shows an
               approximate five year old white female with long brown hair.
               The female is lying on what appears to be a bed or bedding of
               some sort. The child is wearing a pair of black or dark green
               thong type shear underwear and has a white blanket or shawl
               covering her upper body and top of her head. The child is posed
               by an adult male in several sexual positions. The adult male
               appears to be the camera man. The video focuses on the
               prepubescent genitalia of the child. The adult male poses the
               child pulling away her underwear exposing the child's
               genitalia. The adult male spreads the child vagina open and
               several flashes take place appearing that photos are being

               sexual position exposing her prepubescent vagina and anus
               recording video and taking pictures. On Tuesday, June 17, 2014
               I conducted a query on the IP address 134.121.215.206 through
               the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN). ARIN
               reported IP address 134.121.215.206 to be registered to
               Washington State University." On 17 June 2014 at about 0900
               hours, I spoke with Matthew L. Konkel of WSU Information
               Technology Network Security Group. I asked Konkel for the user
               information associated with the IP address for 134.121.215.206
               for the time frame of 1100 hrs to 1108 hours on 16 June 2014.
               Konkel stated the user assigned 134.121.215.206 at the
               specified time was Michael Severns. Konkel stated the Machine
               address for they system being used was 5c9dd740091 with a
               machine name of asis-tech-sp2 located at Streit Perham Hall
               assigned to Housing and Dinning services. I contacted Craig
               Howard, Director Administrative Services Information Systems
               for Housing and Dinning Services. I provided Howard with the
               time, IP Address, machine address and machine name. Howard was
               able to verify through his network system the computer system
               used and confirmed it was Micheal Severns computer system.
               Howard stated to me at about 1545 hours, he was going place the
               computer system in to a secure area. Howard stated the computer
               system was a Dell Tower and belonged to Washington State

               UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 06-17-14 at approximately 1130 hours,
               I was requested to contact the WSU Attorney General's Office
               regarding a possible criminal impersonation and forgery. I met
               with Danielle Hess, Senior Assistant Attorney General, Wendy
               Peterson, Director of Admissions, and several other staff
               members. They stated they recently discovered a subject who had
               been denied enrollment in 2013 had recently enrolled at WSU
               under another subject's name. They stated the subject who is
               now going by the name of Shondre C. Sims (dob 10-13-94) had
               enrolled using the name Nicholas C. Wagner (dob 05-18-93). The
               first WSU Student Identification number issued to Sims when he
               was denied enrollment was 011352699. The current WSU Student
               Identification number issued to Sims is 011451799. On 06-09-14,
               Sims attended the Alive New Student Orientation using the name
               Nicholas Wagner. He registered with the university and obtained
               a WSU Cougar Identification Card using this information. He has
               since sent a fraudulent King County District "Order Granting
               Name Change" form to WSU Payroll Services to change his name to
               Shondre C. Sims (dob 10-13-94). I was shown a copy of the
               document and I contacted King County District Court and
               verified the judge's name used on the document does not exist
               and the numbers used for the Judicial District and Court File
               Number are not consistent with the numbers used by King County
               Courts. WSU also showed me a picture of Sims which was used for
               his Cougar Card. The card was first issued under the name
               Wagner and then changed to Sims. The male in the photograph is
               the same male in the photograph for WA Driver's License issued
               to Shon Drea Curtis Sims (dob 10-13-94). I looked up Nicholas
               Wagner who attends Eastern Oregon University on Facebook and
               found a photograph of him. Wagner is a white male, and Sims is
               a black male. It shows Shondre Sims as a friend of Wagner's on
               Facebook. WSU provided the following names associated with
               Sims' account: Nicholas Curtis Wagner (dob 05-18-1993),
               Nicholas Christian Wagner (dob 10-13-1994), Shon Drea Curtis
               Sims (dob 05-18-1993), Shon Drea Curtis Sims (dob 10-13-1994),
               Shondre Curtis Sims (dob 10-13-1994), and Shondrea Curtis Sims
               (dob 10-13-1994). A check in Spillman shows Sims identified
               himself to a Pullman PD Officer as Shondre C. Sims (dob 06-24-

               for the fall. He would be given a housing assignment, a zzusis
               student account, and would have records contained in payroll,
               admissions, registrar's, and the financial aid offices. MUCH
