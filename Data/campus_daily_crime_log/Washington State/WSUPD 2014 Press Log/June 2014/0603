               XXNO OTHER UNIVERSITY: NARRATIVE: On 060314 at approximately
               0920 hours, I was dispatched to a report of lost property in
               Honors Hall. Upon arrival, I contacted Maria V. Dickson (Vicky)
               who told me the following. On 060214 at approximately 1730
               hours, she walked out of Honors Hall to her car in the rear
               disability parking stall. Vicky told me she was talking on the
               phone and when she reached her car, she thought she put her
               black LG Elite smart phone in her back pocket. She stated she
               thinks she dropped her phone as she was getting in her car.
               Approximately 10 minutes later, her daughter told her she was
               receiving text messages from Vicky's cell phone. Vicky told me
               they texted the phone and asked the person in possession of it
               to turn it in to the police department as found property. Vicky
               stated they didn't receive a response. Vicky valued her phone
               at $150.00, and was unable to locate a serial number. I asked
               her if she has used it on the WSU Wireless Network and she told
               me she has. She told me her NID is dickmv. I contacted Brian
               Hall with WSU IT Security and had him look up Vicky's MAC
               address for her cell phone which he did. Hall told me that the
               last known access was at the McCroskey Hall access point at
               1813 hours on 060214. I asked Hall if he could tell that the
               person in possession of the phone was in McCroskey Hall or not.
               Hall told me that they could have been outside the building
               with the phone. Hall told me that he flagged the MAC address as
               lost/stolen and will monitor if it logs in to the network in
               the future. Case inactive pending further leads. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
