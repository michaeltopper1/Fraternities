    Narrative: RVWD: 316 / OFC:MTK/336 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #:15-W0426 SYNOPSIS: Report of a student
               searching suspicious websites during class. Nothing criminal.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               01/28/15 at approximately 0900 hours I was notified by Sgt.
               Larsen of the report of a student looking at suspicious
               websites during class. Sgt. Larsen provided me a printed out
               email from Chief Gardner that stated the following
               (summarized): Cheryl Hansen (International Studies) called
               Chief Gardner and notified him that the Aware Network (an early
               intervention reporting network) had received 6 independent
               concerns about a student, identified as Jun B. Kwak. The most
               recent concern was from another student, identified as John
               Menard, who saw Kwak accessing suspicious websites during
               class. The email stated that Hansen would forward the
               information to Homeland Security due to Kwak's visa status. I
               called Menard and asked him about the concern. Menard explained
               to me that on 01/26/15 during his 0900 hour History class he
               sat next to Kwak in the front row. Menard said he noticed that
               before class Kwak was surfing what he thought was
               gunbroker.com, and described the site as "blackmarketish".
               Menard said Kwak was looking up AR15 rifles and the like.
               Menard said he found this disturbing. Menard said Kwak was also
               looking up 2 way radios, used cars, and foreign banks like HSBC
               & Barclays. Menard said he determined the students name because
               he was signed into Blackboard. Menard said he spoke with his
               professor after class and they suggested he compile an Aware
               network inquiry. I asked Menard why he felt the internet
               activity was "disturbing". Menard said because of the "current
               social climate with daily shootings" he was disturbed. I asked
               Menard if he knew Kwak and he said he did not and that was his
               first time encountering him. I thanked Menard for his time and
               told him I would contact him in the future if needed. I called
               Hansen and asked her if she could email me the Aware Network
               inquiries, and she did. There was a total of 6 postings, the
               first being 10/01/13 and the last being 01/26/15. I attached
               the document containing the inquiries. Based upon the Aware
               Networks I do not feel there is any police action required.
               Kwak has been contacted twice by WSUPD, one of which resulted
               in a protective custody hold for suicidal statements. I related
               the cases in involvements. I called Hansen and explained to her
               my investigation. I called SA Timothy McAvoy and explained my
               investigation to him and he agreed nothing has occurred that
               would change Kwak's status with his agency. Nothing further. I

               1339 hours WSU Police were toned out to an argument outside of
               Holland Library in Pullman, WA. Ofc. Stewart responded and
               contacted Hoi Y. Pang (01-14-93) in front of the Public Safety
               Building. Ofc. Jones and I drove past Ofc. Stewart and headed
               to the entrance of Holland Library where we contacted Jiaqing
               Liu (04-01-92). Ofc. Jones interviewed Liu who said his ex
               girlfriend Pang came into his classroom in Todd Hall. They left
               Todd Hall and went out to the Terrell Mall in front of Holland
               Library where they argued about their recent breakup. Pang and
               Liu have been living together and dating for the past three
               years. Pang had Liu's sweater and backpack that he asked her to
               take from the classroom. Pang proceeded to empty the contents
               of the backpack onto the ground. Pang dumped his books, papers
               and cell phone onto the ground. Pang shattered the face of the
               cell phone making it inoperable. Liu described Pang as being
               "angry and extremely mad". Pang kept saying to Liu "why are you
               doing this to me?". Witnesses saw Pang dumping the contents of
               the backpack onto the ground and they heard Liu shouting "help
               call police". I interviewed a witness who watched Liu hit Pang
               multiple times on the back of his head and shoulders. The
               witness also said that Pang was not defending himself when Liu
               was striking him. Pang walked away with Liu's sweater. While
               Ofc. Jones continued to interview Liu I went and spoke with
               Michael V. Solomon (09-12-87) who said he saw what had
               happened. I asked Solomon what happened and he told me he was
               walking down Terrell Mall when he saw Pang lunge at Liu and hit
               him multiple times. I asked Solomon if Pang hit Liu with open
               or closed fists and he said he did not remember. Solomon said
               Pang was hitting Liu on the back of Liu's head and shoulders. I
               asked Solomon if Liu was fighting back or if he was doing
               anything to defend himself from Pang and Solomon said no, Liu
               just let Pang hit him. Solomon told me he could not hear Pang
               or Liu saying anything because he was too far away. Solomon
               also told me as other people were trying to break up the fight
               Pang dumped the contents of Liu's backpack on the ground.
               Solomon also said Pang took Liu's cell phone and threw it on
               the ground. Solomon then told me Pang stormed off. I went back

               sweater and backpack from the classroom. Pang said Liu pushed
               her because Liu did not want her to take his stuff. Pang said
               she slapped Liu in the face. Pang then said she kept Liu's
               sweater and walked away. Pang contacted Ofc. Stewart with the
               sweater in her possession. ****Report not complete**** I

               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: Responded to the basement of
               McCoy and found Facilities Operations Electrician, Ted N.
               Townsend. Ted said he was the only person in the basement and
               he didn't, or at least knowingly, set off a Panic Alarm. Ted
               was found in room four, and the panic alarm was supposedly from
               room five. In room five two old portable panic alarm devices
               were found right inside the door of the room. One was sitting
               on a small narrow shelf and the other on the table right below
               the one sitting on the shelf. It is believed when Ted opened
               the door of room five, which was hard to open, the panic alarm
               sitting on the table vibrated off the shelf above landing on
               the table causing the alarm with the immediate reset. No
               emergency. Life Safety will be contacted to see if these old
               panic alarms still need to be active. No further at this time.

               pushing incident on the basketball court at the SRC. Refer
               Demetrius M. Griffin (121591) to Student Conduct. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Demetrius M. Griffin
               Warned/Conduct Assault 2. NARRATIVE: On 012915 at approximately
               1701 hours I was dispatched to an Assault at the Student
               Recreation Center. Dispatch advised me that it involved Whitman
               County Reserve Deputy Tyler L. Langerveld (070292) and he was
               the RP. I responded with Ofc. Whitman and Cpl. Daniels. I spoke
               with Langerveld (070292) who told me he had been playing
               basketball on court 1 and had an incident with a black male by
               the name of Demetrius who was wearing red shorts with white
               stripes. Demetrius had a large tattoo on his back and was
               approximately 23 yoa. Demetrius was later identified as
               Demetrius M. Griffin (121591). Langerveld stated that they both
               had been playing basketball aggressively but Griffin seemed to
               be overly aggressive in play. After one contentious play at the
               basket Griffin pushed Langerveld and Langerveld responded to
               the effect of "what's your problem?" Griffin reportedly
               responded by pushing with both hands to Langerveld's upper
               chest/lower neck. Play stopped because of this interaction.
               Play then continued and later Griffin reportedly feigned a
               punch at Langerveld in an effort to intimidate or have him
               flinch. I spoke with a friend and witness of Langerveld's,
               James D. Leckenby (080991). He essentially recounted the same
               story with a little less detail as he was actively playing on
               the same court. I asked Langerveld what he would like to see
               happen and the essence was that he perceived Griffin to have
               chronic issues of aggression on the court and that in general
               it would be best if Griffin was trespassed from the SRC.
               Langerveld and Leckenby reported non-specific events of Griffin
               having run-ins with other players in the past. Langerveld said
               he hesitated to call based on the contact nature inherent in
               basketball. I then went into the SRC and contacted Griffin at
               court #1. I knew him by sight based on previous contacts and he
               matched the description provided. I informed him we were being
               recorded. Griffin recounted that they had been playing
               aggressively and that he felt the way Langerveld was playing,
               that an injury could be caused. He said it happened again and
               so he pushed him in what he called self-defense. I told him
               what he was describing was not self-defense. He described being
               undercut in the air in which an injury could occur. But once
               back on the ground either on ones feet or sprawled, the action

               of undercutting was not an active threat to injury. Griffin
               admitted to pushing Langerveld but stated he did not remember
               feigning a punch. He said he had many witnesses that would
               state Langerveld was the aggressor. He brought me about 3
               unidentified witnesses who stated they did not see much. I did
               speak with D'Arick D. Dulin (040691) who Langerveld was
               aggressively boxing out during his play. He confirmed there was
               pushing but he said both subjects were pushing each other. I
               then spoke with Griffin. I told him based on the mutual
               combatant nature of contact sports there was some leeway in the
               interpretation of the event. However, Langerveld did feel the
               final push was outside of play. I told Griffin I was not going
               to trespass him at this point in time but that I would refer
               the issue to Student Conduct to see how they would like to
               handle it. He admitted to having had arguments with others over
               basketball in the past but said they had not been physical. We
               all cleared. I later emailed Jeff Elbracht of UREC to see if
               they had previous records of incident reports involving
               Griffin. I am awaiting his response. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               29th day of January, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0435 SYNOPSIS: Responded to a report of
               an intoxicated driver in the Cougar Country drive-thru. I
               contacted the driver who was parked in the Cougar Country
               parking lot. I smelled no alcohol coming from the vehicle or

               2. NARRATIVE: On 01/29/15 at about 1817 I was advised by
               dispatch that Pullman Police were asking for an agency assist
               for a possible traffic offense. I responded to the Cougar
               Country parking lot. The reporting party said they believed a
               driver in the drive-thru was intoxicated. I responded and
               contacted the driver, Suellen B. Weller (070152) who was parked
               in the parking lot of Cougar Country Drive-in when I arrived. I
               could not smell any odor of intoxicant coming from her or her
               vehicle. She was sitting in her vehicle eating an ice cream
               cone. I contacted the employee at Cougar Country and she said
               Weller had difficulty pulling into the drive-thru. The employee
               did not smell the odor of intoxicants coming from Weller. I
               contacted the other reporting party, Sallie M T Gowdy-Burke
               (021063), and she also saw Weller have difficulty getting into
               the drive-thru. She also said when she walked by Weller's
               vehicle to enter Cougar Country she could smell the odor of
               alcohol coming from Weller's vehicle. I contacted Weller again
               and could still not smell the odor of intoxicants. I asked
               Weller if she would volunteer to give a breath sample for my
               PBT. She said she would and provided a sample. The reading on
               the PBT was 0.00. Unfounded. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 29th day of

               The call was reported by Cougar Security. I responded and spoke

               15 I was dispatched to the odor of marijuana coming from
               Stephenson Sounth #417. I responded to the area and contacted
               hall staff. They explained they were doing rounds when they
               detected the odor of burnt marijuana coming from the room. I
               knocked on the door and Oscar I. Deniz-Lucatero answered. He
               was the only one in the room. I asked him if he knew why I was
               there and he said he didn't. I told him it was for smoking
               marijuana in his residence hall room. He said he had just come
               back from a friends house where he had been smoking marijuana.
               When he first open the door the odor was fairly strong, but as
               we spoke the odor disapated. I asked him if there was any
               marijuana in the room. He said he had smoked it all at the
               friends. We discussed his options for smoking marijuana
               legally. He said he understood. I told him I was going to send
               the incident to student conduct. He said he understood and
               apologised for causing problems. I told him he might want to
               reevaluate his being a student here since this was the second
               contact he had for smoking in his room. He said he would think
               about it and I ended the conversation. Nothing

               R. Garwood/013096 Cite/Release MIP Exhibiting 5Z0173304 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 01/29/15 at about 2346 hrs I was driving
               eastbound on Cougar Way when I noticed a male, later identified
               as Jared R. Garwood (013096), who was walking eastbound on
               Cougar Way. He caught my attention because he was stumbling
               side to side as he walked and appeared to be under the age of
               21. I contacted Garwood as he was crossing Cougar Way in front
               of the Physical Education Building. I asked Garwood where he
               was going and he said home to Streit Hall. I told him I wanted
               to talk to him because he appeared to be under 21 and was
               visibly intoxicated. He admitted to having consumed several
               beers earlier. I asked if I could check his eyes and he agreed.
               I administered a horizontal gaze nystagmus test on him. I
               observed he had bloodshot and watery eyes, a lack of smooth
               pursuit, and a distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum
               deviation in both eyes. I could smell the odor of intoxicants
               on Garwood's breath as I administered the test. Garwood spoke
               with slurred speech. I asked Garwood for his ID, which he
               initially said he did not have. After I looked at his back
               pockets and asked him to check his wallet he retrieved his
               Washington Driver's license and provided it to me. His WADL
               confirmed he was under 21. I asked Garwood if he had ever been
               contacted or warned for drugs or alcohol before and he said no.
               I advised him he was under arrest and ran his information
               through Dispatch. As I was waiting for a return I read him his
               Miranda Rights from a pre-printed card. Dispatch advised
               Garwood had a previous warning for intoxication on 10/11/14. I
               placed Garwood in handcuffs (double locked) and had him sit in
               the back of my patrol car while I completed a citation. I
               issued Garwood a criminal citation for minor intoxicated in a
               public place. I explained the citation to him, he received his
               copy, and was released. Nothing further. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               30 day of January, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               Way when I noticed a group of three females walking eastbound
               from Thatuna Rd. They caught my attention because one of the
               females, later identified as Tessa M. Cleary (040396), appeared
               to be under the age of 21. She was stumbling as she walked and
               was receiving quite a bit of assistance walking from both of
               her friends. I stopped and contacted the group as they reached
               the entrance to the Holland Library parking garage. I asked
               where they were going and they said home to Streit Hall. I

               Way when I noticed a male, later identified as Ray A. Neevel
               (070895), who was walking eastbound on Cougar Way near Regents
               Hall. Neevel caught my attention because he appeared to be
               under the age of 21 and was stumbling as he walked.
               Additionally, several times Neevel stopped and bent over at the
               waist before beginning to run a short distance. He would then
               stop and walk/stumble for a bit before stopping and then
               running again. I contacted Neevel along Cougar Way in front of

               ID with him and he provided me with his driver's license, which
               confirmed he was under 21. I asked how much he had to drink and
               he told me two mixed drinks. I asked if I could check his eyes
               and he agreed. I administered a horizontal gaze nystagmus test
               on him. I observed he had bloodshot and watery eyes, a lack of
               smooth pursuit, and a distinct and sustained nystagmus at
               maximum deviation in both eyes. I asked Neevel to provide a
               breath sample on a PBT and he agreed. He provided a sample of
               .256 on alco sensor FST #5493. I tried to have Neevel contact
               his roommate so we could make sure someone was staying with him
               tonight but Neevel was uncooperative in that regard. He was
               able to answer all of my questions and appeared oriented to his
               surroundings and able to care for himself. I advised Neevel I
               would be forwarding charges to the Whitman County Prosecutor
               for MIP Exhibiting and he was allowed to continue home. Nothing

               of Hall staff he was identified as Lorne P. Mongeau (071292).
