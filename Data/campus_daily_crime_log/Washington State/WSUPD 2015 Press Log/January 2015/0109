               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0069 01/09/15 SYNOPSIS: Female riding a
               bicycle crashed and fell on the sidewalk near McCoy Hall.
               Patient transported by ambulance to Pullman Regional Hospital.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               January 9, 2015 at about 0701 hours Pullman Fire and WSU Police
               were dispatched to a fall outside of McCoy Hall. Sgt. Macy and
               I responded to the area. We located the female patient on the
               sidewalk near McCoy Hall. The patient was riding her bicycle on
               the sidewalk when she crashed and fell. She was wearing a
               helmet at the time. She complained of left knee pain. It
               appeared she may have hit her face on the ground as there was
               dirt, scratches and blood around her mouth and nose. The
               temperature at the time of incident was about 29 degrees
               Fahrenheit according to my patrol vehicle temperature gauge.
               There was freezing fog and the ground was slippery where it had
               not been deiced. I did not notice the sidewalk to be slippery
               when I was out with the patient. It appeared to have been
               deiced. Pullman Fire personnel treated and transported the
               patient to Pullman Regional Hospital. I transported her bicycle
               and helmet to the WSU Police Department for safekeeping.
               Assistance provided, no further investigation. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               9th day of January, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               I was dispatched to Stephenson East for a drugs call. An RA
               said they could smell the odor of marijuana coming from room
               1109. I called and spoke to Joshua B. McPhatter (062489) the
               RED and he said he also smelled the odor of marijuana coming
               from room 1109. He said he believed there was only one resident
               in the room, Amari N. Franklin (082796). I looked at a drugs
               call from August 2014 in the same room but Franklin was not
               contacted during that call. I responded to Stephenson East and
               met McPhatter on the 11th floor. He told me that Franklin had
               been walking between room 1109 and 1107 but he was in 1109 now
               and that is where the odor was coming from. I went to room
               1109. I could not smell an odor of marijuana outside of the
               room. I knocked and Franklin opened the door. I could then
               smell a strong odor of marijuana coming from the room. I asked
               Franklin if he knew why I was there. He said that he did not. I
               asked him his name and date of birth. He gave me the
               information. I asked him if he had a medical marijuana card. He
               stated he did not. I told Franklin I could smell a strong odor
               of marijuana coming from his room, and I asked him if he had
               marijuana in the room. At first he stated that he did not but
               then told me that he had some marijuana in the room. I
               explained he could collect the marijuana from the room and any
               drug paraphernalia and he could destroy it and I would forward
               my report to student conduct. Franklin said he would retrieve
               the marijuana from the room and destroy it. He got a baggy from
               his desk drawer that had some marijuana in the bag as well as a
               bottle with the butt of swisher sweet and a container of seeds.
               Franklin said the swisher is how he smoked the marijuana. I
               asked Franklin if that was it because the odor was strong and
               the amount he brought out of his room was not much. He said
               that was it and said that I could search the room. I explained
               to him that he had the right to refuse a search of his room,
               that he could limit the search or stop the search. Franklin
               said I could search his side of the room. Corporal Daniels and
               I searched his side of the room and found a tin with some trace

               amounts of marijuana, and a baggy with trace amounts of
               marijuana. Franklin took all items to the dumpster behind
               Stephenson East and destroyed them and threw them in the trash.
               I warned Franklin about possession and use of marijuana under
               21 years of age and that it is not allowed in the dorms. I also
               told him I would be forwarding my report to student conduct.

               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0079 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched
               to a drugs call at Stephenson East room 1107. An RED smelled
               the odor of marijuana coming from the room. I contacted a male
               in the room, he admitted to having marijuana in the room. He
               destroyed the marijuana and I warned him about marijuana use
               and possession. Report forwarded to student conduct. NAME/DOB

               Warned Possession of Marijuana 2. NARRATIVE: On 01/09/15 at
               about 2147 hours I was dispatched to a drugs call at Stephenson
               East room 1107. I called the reporting party Joshua B McPhatter
               (062489). He said he could smell marijuana coming from the
               room. I had been to a call earlier in the evening on the same
               floor in room 1109. I asked McPhatter if it was the same
               subject from that case. He said he did not think it was. I
               responded to Stephenson East and went to room 1107. I could
               smell the odor of marijuana around the door jam. I was about to
               knock on the door when a male, William A. Britton (022996),
               opened the door to come out. I asked Britton if he knew why I
               was there. He said he did not. I asked him how old he was he
               said he was 18. I asked him if he had a medical marijuana card.
               He said he did not. I told him I could smell the odor of
               marijuana coming from the room. I asked if he had any marijuana
               in his room. He said he did earlier when his sister dropped him
               off but he gave it back to her when she left. I explained that
               he could collect all of the marijuana and drug paraphernalia
               from the room and destroy it and I would forward my report to
               student conduct, or I could apply for a search warrant which
               may lead to criminal charges in addition to forwarding my
               report to student conduct. I had looked up recent calls from
               this floor earlier in the night and recognized Britton's name
               as being contacted about marijuana use in the dorms. Britton
               confirmed he was contacted in August of 2014 and warned then.
               Britton said he had a marijuana grinder in his room with
               marijuana in it. He said he would get it and destroy it. I
               asked him if that was everything in the room. He said he
               thought so. I asked if he thought so or knew that was it. He
               went back into the room and brought out a bong. Corporal
               Daniels asked him again if that was everything out of the room.
               Britton said that was all. Daniels asked Britton if he would
               let us search his room. Britton said that was okay. We searched
               the room and Corporal Daniels found two small containers with
               trace amounts of marijuana in them. I also found a small scale
               in the room, the type of scale often used to weigh marijuana.

               Britton said that it was not his. Britton did not have a
               roommate. I asked whose it was, he said it belonged to a friend
               of his, Ben. He did not want to provide Ben's full name.
               Nothing else was found. I escorted Britton to the dumpster
               outside Stephenson East. Britton destroyed the items and threw
               them in the dumpster. I warned Britton about use and possession
               of marijuana and told him I would forward my report to student
               conduct. I asked Britton if he had any questions and he said he
               did not have any. Warned. Nothing further. Officer Curtis

               about 2232 hours I was dipatched to the report of a parking
               problem at Olympia Hall. The hall director, Britteny L.
               Alspach, advised that there was an unauthorized red Ford Focus
               parked in the hall director's parking spot. I responded to the

               hall directors space. Benjamin R. Ostby was located in Spillman
               as being associated with this vehicle. I called Ostby and
               explained to him that his car needed to be moved. He said he'd
               be right out. A few minutes later Damion A. Clark came to me
               and said he was responsible for the car and would move it. I
               warned Clark about parking in reserved parking spaces. I gave

               a possible malicious mischief in a locker room at Bohler Gym. I
               responded to Bohler and talked with custodial staff. They
               showed me the damage in the old WSU football team locker room
               as well as a wall in the west entrance of the Bohler Gym
               Addition. I photographed both areas of damage. I asked the
               custodian Brian Kriebel when the damage occurred. He said
               sometime between 8pm and the time of the call. During that time
               there was a Pullman High School basketball game at Bohler Gym.
               I called the principal of PHS, Joe P. Thorton (092559), and
               asked if he had been advised of any incidents at the game. He
               said he had not. He gave me the phone number for the Coach of
               the PHS basketball team, which was the team in that locker
               room. I called the coach Craig B. Brantner (020271) and asked
               him if he knew anything about the damage. He said the holes in
               the ceiling of the locker room were already there and that he
               had seen them when he was shown the locker room in December. He
               said he talked about the holes in the ceiling with William E.
               Drake (052967) who had unlocked the locker room for him in
               December. On 01/10/15 at about 1900 I called and spoke to Drake
               he said he remember some damage to the locker room, he saw in

               the locker room. He did not recall any damage to the ceiling in
               the locker room. I asked if he would be willing to do a walk
               through with an officer to point out the damage he saw. Drake
               also said he had talked to Shawn Deeds about the damage. He
               also said the visiting teams from this years WSU football

               the door. I checked all the doors in the area of 323. 323 was
               the only one with a strong odor of burnt marijuana coming from

               asked if he lived in the room and he said he did. I asked if
               there was anyone else on the room and he said it was just him.
               I asked him if he knew why we were contacting him and he said
               "I did a really bad thing." I asked him what that bad thing was
               and he said "I was smoking marijuana." I asked him what was in
               the room and he said a small amount of marijuana and a bong. I
               told him what the options were in this case and asked him if he
               would be willing to take the bong and marijuana and destroy
               them. He said he would, so we went to one of the dumpsters
               where he threw the bong in breaking it and then crushed up the
               marijuana and threw it in the dumpster. I told Anton that I was

               would be saught. I told him that hall staff wanted to speak to
