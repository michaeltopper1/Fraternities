               nuts removed from the left rear tire of his vehicle. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: Paul Gawith
               reported that sometime between Wednesday evening, 1/21/15, and
               Thursday morning, 1/22/15, someone removed four lug nuts from
               the left rear tire of his 2000 Volvo S80 T-6. The vehicle was
               parked in the Crimson 2 lot just north of Waller Hall. Gawith
               did not realize the lug nuts were missing until after
               attempting to drive the vehicle. The Rotor on the axle was
               damaged and will need to be replaced. No other damage has been
               observed. Gawith has no proof, but he believes his ex-roommate
               may be involved in the removal of the four lug nuts. Gawith and
               his ex-roommate, Martin Kearns, had a falling out over Kearns
               having marijuana in their room. Kearns has since moved out of
               Waller Hall and into Gannon/Goldsworthy (room unknown). Gawith
               did not want police to contact Kearns about this situation at
               this time. Gawith is going to park his vehicle in a different
               location and contact police if any additional damage/thefts
               happen to his vehicle. Gawith did not know his license plate
               number, but said he would e-mail it to me. No further at this
               time. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the
               laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this ____ day of _____________, 2015, in

               lot Xing's vehile was parked next too, and facing, the Child
               Center in the third parking stall from the South side. Thein's
               vehicle was parked facing the oppisite direction in the middle
               of the parking lot about ten feet behind and offset about a
               vehicle's width to the south of Xing's vehicle. Both Xing,
               Thein and Pyayt Oo (passenger in Thein's vehicle and his son)
               indicated no one was hurt. I asked Xing to explain to me what
               had happened. Xing told me both vehicles were backing and ran
               into each other. Oo, who indicated Thein had difficulty with
               English, said that was not the case. Oo said they had been
               parked on the left side of Xing and had just back out of the
               space and were making a "U" type turn behind Xing so they could
               leave the parking lot. Oo said they were pulling forward when
               struck by Xing. When Xing heard this she started saying she
               could not see, indicating the accident could not be her fault
               because she could not see Thein's vehicle. Xing said Thein's
               vehicle sat to low for her to see. Xing even tried to get me to
               sit in her vehicle so that I could see that she could not see
               Thein's vehicle. Xing then started to insist that Thein had to
               be backing up because of the location I certify and declare

               she had it earlier in the day and put it into her backpack. She

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0315 SYNOPSIS: I was contacted by a male
               in a motorized wheelchair. He said someone had parked too close
               to his vehicle and he could not get his ramp down in order to
               get in his vehicle. He asked if I would back his vehicle up so
               he could access the ramp. I did so and he was able to get into
               his vehicle. The owner may have damaged another vehicle.
               Investigation continues. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR#

               contacted by a male, Benjamin R. Migliuri (101592). Migliuri
               was in a motorized wheelchair and had parked his vehicle
               (WA/U116WSU) next to Wilson Short Hall earlier. He returned to
               his vehicle and someone had parked too close to his vehicle and
               he could not get his ramp down in order to get in his vehicle.
               He asked if I would back his vehicle up so he could access the
               ramp. I did so and he was able to get into his vehicle. He had
               attempted to lower his ramp before he contacted me and there
               may have been contact with the vehicle next to his
               (WA/AKX2765). I saw a small scratch just in front of the rear
               driver's side wheel well, which may have been fresh. I left my
               business card on the vehicle that may have been damaged. The
               owner Vanessa J. Ward (050759) called me back and left me a
               voicemail. I will contact her tomorrow reference the damage.
               Investigation continues. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 22nd day of January,

    Narrative: RVWD:MJG/309 / OFC: BRW/325 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0320 SYNOPSIS: I backed Ofc. Gordon on a
               DUI stop at North Grand and Tesoro. Driver was arrested for
               DUI. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               01/23/14 at approximately 0244 I heard Ofc. Gordon ask for
               another Officer on his traffic stop at North Grand and Tesoro.
               Upon arrival Ofc. Gordon was talking to the driver at the
               driver's side window. Ofc. Gordon asked the driver to speak
               with him on the sidewalk. The driver attempted to get out of
               his car with his seatbelt still on. The seatbelt yanked the
               driver back into the seat. The driver took of his seatbelt and
               exited. The driver spoke very limited English so I remained on
               scene with Ofc. Gordon while he performed SFTSs. I held a cell
               phone with a language line translator on speaker phone. When
               Ofc. Gordon reached the PBT, he asked if we could use my PBT
               since his was not working properly. The driver provided a PBT
               sample of .117. Ofc. Gordon placed the driver under arrest for
               DUI. Ofc. Gordon transported the driver to the Pullman Holding
               Facility as I remained on scene with the car. Auto Body Super
               Center took custody of the car and I cleared. END OF REPORT I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 23rd day of January, 2015, in Pullman,
