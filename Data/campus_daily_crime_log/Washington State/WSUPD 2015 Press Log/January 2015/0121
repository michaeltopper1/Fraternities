               stop sign violation at NE North Fairway Lane. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On January 21, 2015 I
               received a report of a school bus stop violation from Pullman
               School District #267. According to the report the violation
               occurred on Tuesday, January 15, 2015 at about 1152 hours at
               the bus stop on North Fairway Lane at Bailey-Brayton Field
               school bus stop. The OSPI School Bus Stop Violation report form
               has been added to the case file. Nour Alsouwd was operating bus
               #9, a fully marked Pullman School District #267 school bus. The
               bus was stopped in the roadway to discharge and receive school
               children using the red lights and stop paddle for traffic
               control. Alsouwd writes that the suspect vehicle "Came from
               behind the bus while I'm crossing a mother with her daughter.
               The stop sign was out. It was very dangerous situation. He was
               going at a high speed." In addition Alsouwd wrote "This vehicle
               almost hit the mom and student that was crossing the street."
               Alsouwd described the vehicle as a gray, Toyota Camry with
               Washington license plate UF30. Alsouwd did not describe the
               driver.. The vehicle license returned "no computer record
               found." I could not locate the vehicle in the Spillman
               database. I am unable to contact the registered owner or driver
               as I do not have a valid license plate. No infractions or
               citations issued. When the OSPI form arrives I will fill it out
               and returned to the Pullman School District and scan it into
               the case. No further investigation. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 21st day of

               about 1634 hours I was dispatched to a possible cold theft at
               McCroskey Hall. The reporting party, Miriam R. Lewis (120895),
               was requesting phone contact. I called Lewis, the owner of the
               bicycle, and got a description of the bicycle. She described it
               as a blue and silver Jaguar bicycle. Lewis also said there was
               a "license" plate on the back of the bicycle that reads
               "Miriam". She said she did not know what the serial number of
               the bicycle was and did not put an owner applied on it. I
               checked local records and did not find any bicycles matching
               the description of Lewis's bicycle. I entered the bicycle into
               local records. I explained to Lewis the bicycle could not be
               entered into the state or federal computer system for stolen
               items without a serial number or owner applied number. No
               suspects, no leads. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 21st day of January,

               hours I was dispatched to a possible traffic offense. The
               reporting party said he say two males parked in the green
               parking lot at the corner of Columbia St and Idaho St drinking
               what appeared to be alcohol. I responded and located the
               vehicle. As I approached the vehicle (ID/1A1M912) the driver
               started the vehicle. I contacted the driver Jason J. Wang
               (070292). When I was at the window of the vehicle I could smell
               an odor of alcohol coming from the vehicle. I asked Wang how
               many drinks he had. He said he and his passenger had parked in
               the parking lot drinking a beer before he went to an exam. I
               asked if he would step out of the vehicle and take some
               voluntary field sobriety test. Wang said he would. Wang
               performed the standardized field sobriety test and I determined
               he was not impaired. I asked Wang if he would provide a
               voluntary breath sample for the PBT. He said he would. He
               provided a sample to my ALCO Sensor FST (SN#102461) and it
               recorded a reading of .017. I performed the PBT in accordance
               with state toxicologist recommendations and I have been trained
               in using the ALCO Sensor FST PBT. I had Wang empty out the two
               open containers of alcohol in the vehicle and he placed the
               remaining bottles in the trunk. I warned him about the crime of
               physical control and about open alcohol containers in his
               vehicle. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 21st day of January,
