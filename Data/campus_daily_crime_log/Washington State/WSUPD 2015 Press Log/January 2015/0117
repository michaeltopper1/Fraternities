               (061694), and Mary C. Paxson (022952). Paxson-Tarnai was

               driving the white, 2006 Volvo S40 (WA/AGV8293). Paxson was a

               driving through the upper tier of the parking lot saw an open
               space and began to back up. She did not see the white Volvo

               happened, made by both drivers, were consistent. All damage
               that occurred was consistent with the statements made by both

               Yellow parking lot #124. A grey Toyota Sienna (WA/AFR3631)
               backed into a light blue Honda Civic (WA/AKJ9732) while trying
               to park. It was dark and raining, making visibility somewhat
               difficult. The driver of the Sienna left a note on the
               windshield with his phone number (509-847-9568) and a message
               stating "I bumped your car". I placed a business card with the
               Police Case Number on it inside of an evidence bag and placed
               it on the windshield of the Honda Civic. More to follow. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of

               was hit by a van at Stadium Way and Grimes Way. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 01/17/15 at
               approximately 2104 hours, Medics were dispatched to Stephenson
               East room 701 where Janelle Kathryn Thomas 07/04/96 was
               reporting her leg was hurting after being hit by a car. I
               responded to room 701 and found Thomas inside. I asked if I
               could come in and Thomas said I could. Thomas was sitting in a
               computer chair and it appeared as if she had been crying. I
               asked Thomas about the collision. Thomas stated she had been
               walking southbound on Stadium Way and was crossing the
               intersection of Grimes Way. Thomas stated she had waited until
               the crossing signal turned green and she started through the
               crosswalk. Thomas stated she remembered looking at the crossing
               signal and it said she had 12 more second to cross when a white
               van hit her in the crosswalk. Thomas said the van was heading
               southbound on Stadium Way and turned left onto Grimes Way when
               she was struck. Thomas stated she believes that she lost
               consciousness for about 3 to 5 seconds. Thomas said the driver
               of the van stopped and asked if she was ok. Thomas told the
               driver that she was fine. The driver asked if Thomas wanted her
               to call an ambulance and Thomas said she did not need one.
               Thomas told the driver she was fine and was going to just walk
               home. At this point the driver and Thomas parted ways. Thomas
               walked the rest of the way home to Stephenson East. About 30
               minutes after the collision Thomas said he leg began to hurt
               more and more so she had her RA call for medics. Thomas
               described the driver as a white female, college aged, with
               blond hair. Thomas said the driver was wearing sorority letters
               on her sweatshirt but did not know what sorority it was. I
               asked Thomas if they exchanged information and Thomas said she
               did not. Thomas described the van as a white boxy van with
               sliding doors. Thomas stated it was more like a utility van
               than a mini van. I asked Thomas what she would like me to do
               with her case. Thomas asked if I could look into if I could
               figure out who was driving the van. I told Thomas that I would
               review the camera footage from that intersection and see what I
               could find out. I provided Thomas with my business card and her
               case number. Thomas was evaluated by medics and Thomas decided
               to have her friend drive her to Pullman Regional Hospital to
               have her leg checked on. Once at the station I attempted to
               look up the camera footage from the intersection. I was unable
               to look at the footage because the Cisco camera system needed

               drugs call at Streit Hall room 638. I responded and met with
               hall staff. They said there was an odor of marijuana coming
               from room 638. I asked the RA if they knew who was in the room,
               she said she did not know. I went to room 638 and could smell a
               strong odor of marijuana coming from the room. I knocked on the
               door and Riley T. Jackson (050796) answered the door. When he
               opened the door the odor of marijuana became even stronger. I
               asked if anyone else was in the room. He said there was not. I
               asked Jackson if he knew why we were there. He said he did not.
               I told Jackson I could smell a strong odor of marijuana coming
               from his room. I asked Jackson if he was under 21, he said he
               was. I asked him if he had a medical marijuana card, he said he
               did not. I asked if there was any marijuana in the room. He
               said there was no marijuana left in the room because he just
               smoked the last of his marijuana. Jackson's eyes were watery
               and his eye lids were drooping. Jackson said he just smoked
               marijuana in his dorm room about twenty minutes before we
               arrived. I told him to collect any marijuana or drug
               paraphernalia that was left in the room and he could destroy
               it. I explained that I would be forwarding my report to student

               crack of room 429 and confirmed the odor was coming from within
               room 429. I knocked on the door and Jeffrey J. Moberg 05/11/95
               answered the door. I explained to Moberg why I was called to
               his room and told him that if he was willing to turn over all
               of his marijuana and smoking devices, we would go to the
               dumpster, destroy his illegal items, and he would only be
               referred to student conduct. Moberg agreed to my proposal and
               grabbed a glass jar containing a few sandwich bags. Inside one
               sandwich bag was a small amount of marijuana. I asked Moberg
               what he had smoked with and he said his friend provided him
               with rolling papers. I asked Moberg if he had a medical

               just come over and was not involved in the smoking of
               marijuana. Jenks also stated he was not involved. I told Jenks
               that he would be referred to student conduct for being
               associated with the call but it was up to student conduct to
               determine if there was a policy violation. Moberg, Cpl.
               Edwards, and I walked to the dumpster where Moberg destroyed
               his illegal items. I explained the student conduct process to

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0239 SYNOPSIS: Fouthe arrested, cited,
               and released for MIP Exhibiting. PBT .073 NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Kaylee Ann Fouthe 12/19/95
               Cited/Released MIP Exhibiting 5Z0156164 2. NARRATIVE: On
               01/18/15 at approximately 0104 hours I was sitting in the
               Community Duncan Dunn parking lot off of B St when I noticed
               three females walking northbound on B St. One female grabbed my
               attention in particular. The middle female, later identified as
               Kaylee Ann Fouthe 12/19/95, had both of her arms over the
               shoulders of the two outside females. Even though Fouthe was
               being supported as she walked, Fouthe was stumbling side to
               side bumping into her friends. The whole group was weaving as
               they walked because of how much Fouthe was stumbling. Fouthe
               appeared to be under the age of 21. At the time I decided not
               to contact the three since they were walking towards greek row
               which is not my jurisdiction. At approximately 0116 hours I was
               driving eastbound on Cougar Way near the Soccer Field when I
               saw the three females again. Fouthe was still stumbling
               severely and was a stark contrast to the several other people
               walking on the sidewalk near her. I contacted Fouthe next to
               the Physical Education Building and Fouthe still had her arms
               over the shoulders of her friends. I told Fouthe I needed to
               talk to her and all three stopped. I decided to ask Fouthe a
               series of questions to determine her mental status. Fouthe
               removed her arms from the shoulders of the other two and began
               to answer my questions. Fouthe answered all questions
               correctly. As Fouthe now stood unsupported she was swaying back
               and forth. A few times she had to move her feet back and forth
               to keep her balance. As Fouthe spoke I could clearly smell the
               strong odor of intoxicants coming from her breath. About this
               time Cpl. Edwards arrived on scene. I asked Fouthe if she had
               her ID and she said no. Fouthe's friend handed me Fouthe's WSU
               cougar card. I asked Fouthe how old she was and Fouthe said she
               was 18 years old. I asked for Fouthe's date of birth and she
               provided it verbally. Fouthe then said, "well technically I'm
               19." I asked Fouthe if I could check her eyes and she said I
               could. I told Fouthe to look at where my finger was touching
               the tip of my pen. It took several times of me tapping where I
               was talking about until Fouthe could figure it out. I told
               Fouthe to keep her head still and only follow the pen with her
               eyes. Fouthe said ok. As soon as I moved my pen Fouthe moved
               her head to follow the pen. During the test Fouthe was
               constantly moving her head and swaying back and forth. After a

               few passes Fouthe stopped following the pen and rather looked
               at me. I had to tell Fouthe to keep looking at the pen. I was
               unable to complete the HGN test because Fouthe was not
               following my directions. During the test I able to observe
               equal pupil size, equal tracking, lack of smooth pursuit, and
               distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation. Fouthe's
               eyes were watery and he eyelids were droopy. I asked Fouthe how
               much she had to drink and Fouthe said not that much. I asked
               how many drinks that was. Fouthe said she had four beers and
               went on to tell me how it is different for every person when
               they are drunk. Fouthe was not making sense. I asked Fouthe if
               she was willing to provide a PBT sample. Fouthe said, "I guess,
               I guess, I guess." I found my PBT (Alco-Sensor FST #16805) in
               working condition. Fouthe provided a PBT sample of .073. The
               PBT sample that Fouthe provided was not consistent with the
               physical signs of intoxication that I was seeing. I asked
               Fouthe if she had mixed prescription medications with alcohol.
               Fouthe said no. Fouthe's behavior was more like someone who
               would be around .150 BAC. I told Fouthe that she was under
               arrest for MIP Exhibiting and handcuffed (D/L) her. I advised
               Fouthe of her right to counsel. At my direction Fouthe was
               searched by Intern Cody-Berry. No weapons or illegal items were
               found. Fouthe was placed in the backseat of my patrol car while
               I researched Fouthe's local involvements. On 11/02/14 Fouthe
               was found next to Dominos Pizza where she had fallen and hit
               her head on the pavement. Ofc. Emerson responded and found
               Fouthe to be very intoxicated but not to the point where she
               needed to be taken into protective custody. Fouthe also
               divulged that she has been sent to student conduct twice before
               for alcohol related issues. I issued Fouthe Sector citation
               5Z0156164 for MIP Exhibiting. I explained the citation to
               Fouthe and provided her with her copy. Fouthe was released from
               custody and walked home with her friends. END OF REPORT I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of

               dispatched to the report of a drugs call at Community Duncan
               Dunn room 77. Whitcom advised that the RED, Griffin Uchida,
               could smell the odor of marijuana emitting from room 77. Sgt.
               Griffin and I responded to the area. As soon as I walked into
               the hallway I could smell the odor of marijuana. I walked
               towards room 77 and could smell the odor of marijuana. After
               passing the doorway the odor dissipated. I put my nose to the
               crack of the door of room 77 and could smell the odor of
               marijuana. I smelled the doors surrounding room 77 and could
               not smell the odor of marijuana emitting from them. I could
               hear several voices talking and laughing inside room 77. The
               rest of the hallway was quiet. I knocked on the door and the
               voices stopped. I knocked again and could hear shuffling around
               inside the room. I knocked a third time and somebody said "who
               is it". I said "Ashley" and a male, later identified as Mitchel
               M. Chervets, answered the door. As soon as the door opened the
               odor of marijuana became stronger. I asked who lived in the
               room and Chervets said he did with Jacob R. Halela. I asked how
               many people were in the room and they said there was a total of
               six. I asked them to all step into the hallway so I could
               discuss with them why I was there. Everybody from the room came
               out into the hallway and were later identified as Kayla C.
               Rucker, Sebastian K. Daszczynski, Sarah A. Borgnes and Richard
               M. Hutson. I explained to everybody why I was there and gave
               them an opportunity to be honest with me. Chervets spoke for
               the group and told me that there was no marijuana in his room
               and was adament that they had not been smoking marijuana. I
               could see everybody had bloodshot, watery eyes except for
               Hutson. Daszczynski spoke up and wanted to tell me that they
               are good people. He was somewhat argumentative with Sgt.
               Griffin and I and kept interupting as we were trying to speak
               with the group. He then went on to explain how whenever he is
               in the hallway he always smells marijuana. I then explained to

               were for tonight. I explained to them that I would give them
               the opportunity to retrieve anything from their room that was
               illegal for them to possess and they could take it to the
               dumpster and destroy it and I would send the information to
               Student Conduct or I could apply for a search warrant and if it
               was granted I would search the room, seize any illegal items,
               and charge them with the respective crimes. Chervets and Halela
               decided to retrieve what they had in their room which was the
               following items: 2 unopened bottles of Champagne 1 bottle of
               tequila, about 1/4 gone 1 bottle of vodka, appeared to be
               almost empty I escoted them out to the dumpsters to destroy the
               alcohol. I went back inside with them and explained to the
               group what the process was regarding student conduct. As I was
               clearing the call Daszczynski asked if he could speak to me
               down the hall. He then said that he was a medical marijuana
               patient and that the odor we were smelling was most likely from
               him. I asked him why he didn't just tell us that earlier. He
               said that he wanted to tell us but I wouldn't let him. Vievu
               video was downloaded to the s: drive. Case to student conduct

               from her nose. The resident stated he found the female in the
               bathroom with the lights off. I called out to Urueta but she
               did not answer. I told Urueta that if she did not respond to me
               I would have to induce pain on her to make sure she was wake.
               Again Urueta did not answer. I pinched the skin on the back
               side of Urueta's right arm and she opened her eyes. I asked
               Urueta if she could hear me and Urueta grunted. I asked Urueta
               several questions but she was unable to communicate very well.
               It was very clear that Urueta was highly intoxicated. I was
               able to get Urueta to tell me her first and last name as well
               as her date of birth. Once medics arrived they determined that
               Urueta was unable to care for herself and transported her to
               Pullman Regional Hospital for an alcohol detox. Once medics had
               loaded Urueta into the ambulance, I cleared. END OF REPORT I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 19th day of January, 2015, in Pullman,

    Narrative: RVWD: AE/330 OFC: BRW/325 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0245 SYNOPSIS: Johnson reported Wright
               was outside her apartment banging on the door to be let inside.
               Johnson thought it was Wright but never actually looked outside
               to see who was banging on her door. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 01/18/15 at approximately 0335
               hours, I responded to 1401 NE Merman Dr, apartment 704 where
               Brianna C. Johnson 10/18/95 was reporting someone banging on
               her front door demanding to be let inside. Sgt. Griffin, Cpl.
               Edwards, and I responded to the call. Upon arrival Cpl. Edwards
               and I contacted Johnson. When we arrived at apartment 704 there
               was nobody outside. Johnson stated that someone had been
               pounding on her door to be let inside and tried the door knob.
               Johnson stated she believed Dominique M. Wright 08/13/93 was
               the person responsible. I asked Johnson if she looked out the
               window and saw Wright. Johnson said she was too scared to look
               outside so she never actually saw who was pounding on her door.
               Johnson stated that Wright has done this in the past and that's
               why she believes it was him. Johnson and Wright have a child in
               common and have had issues with domestic violence in the past.
               Sgt. Griffin and Cpl. Edwards searched the area for Wright who
               has an active warrant for his arrest. Wright was not found in
               the area. Johnson did not know where Wright was currently
               staying because he keeps saying at different friends houses. I
               urged Johnson to look into obtaining a restraining order
               against Wright so Officers could better assist her when Wright
               shows up to her place. I told Wright to call 911 if anything
               else happened. I could not see any signs of attempted entry
               into the apartment. The crime of trespassing is unfounded. END
               OF REPORT I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 18th day of January, 2015, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer
