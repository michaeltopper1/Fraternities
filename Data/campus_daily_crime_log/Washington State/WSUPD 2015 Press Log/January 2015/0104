               04-15 at about 2128 hours I was dispatched to the report of a
               two vehicle, non-injury collision in the parking lot entrance
               to Steptoe Village Apartments. At the time of the collision it
               was raining and driving conditions were extremely bad, with
               several inches of snow on the ground. I contacted the driver's
               of each vehicle and asked what happened. Ruth Mwawasi, the
               driver of the Honda Civic, told me that she was trying to go
               into the parking lot of Steptoe Apartments but her vehicle lost
               traction and she started to slide backwards on the slick
               pavement. Mwawasi said she tried to go forward but her car
               would only slide backwards. She later told me that she had
               chains for her tires but she had removed them because she
               thought they were illegal in city limits. Mwawasi had one
               passenger in her vehicle, identified as Milcah N. Okonda. They
               advised they were not injured. I asked Mwawasi if there was any
               damage to her car and she showed me a scratch on the passenger
               side of the rear bumper. I then spoke to Jordan Prokosch. He
               said that he was pulling into the parking lot of Steptoe
               Village Apartments when he noticed the car in front of him, the
               Honda Civic, started to slide backwards towards him. He said he
               was unable to get out of the way and the Honda Civic slid into
               his vehicle. He said he was not injured. I asked Prokosch if
               there was any damage to his car and he said no, not that he
               could see. I took pictures of the vehicles and later uploaded
               them to Spillman Files. PPD Officer Myklebust and I then
               assisted Mwawasi with putting her tire chains on her vehicle.
               She was able to continue into the parking lot with the chains
               on her tires. Myklebust, Officer Westerman and I then helped
               push Prokosch's car up the hill into the parking lot. I gave
               both driver's my business card with the case number. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true

               01/05/15 at approximately 0555 hours I responded to a motion
               alarm at the ORC. From prior experience I know the ORC motion
               sensors to be tripped by high winds, such as the winds we were
               experiencing at the time of the call. I responded to the ORC
               and walked through the building. Nobody was found inside. The
               alarm was reset and I cleared. END OF REPORT I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               5th day of January, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.
