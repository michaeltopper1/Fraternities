               NARRATIVE: On 01/11/15 at approximately 2133 hours I was
               dispatched to a drugs call at Goldsworthy Hall room 118. Upon
               arrival I met with the RED on duty, Ross McClure. McClure said
               he did not know if anybody was still inside the room or not but
               the room smelled of burnt marijuana and fabreeze. I walked up
               to room 118 and confirmed it smelled of burnt marijuana and
               fabreeze. I knocked on the door for a few minutes without
               anybody answering. I could not hear any movement inside the
               room. McClure was able to look up the two names of the people
               assigned to room 118. Luke N. Barrett 01/26/96 and Sidney N.
               Ankrah 11/04/95 were listed as the occupants. McClure stated
               that after the RA's located the room Barrett exited the room
               and went to the bathroom. Barrett realized that the RA's were
               watching his room and he left the building. McClure did not
               believe that Ankrah was inside the room and also stated he
               believed Barrett was the one who was responsible for smoking
               marijuana in the room. Both males will be referred to student
               conduct for the illegal activities that occurred inside their
               room. END OF REPORT I certify and declare under penalty of

               Marijuana N/A NARRATIVE: On 01-11-15 at about 2135 hours I was
               dispatched to the report of the odor of marijuana emitting from
               Regents Hall room 205. Whitcom advised that the RED, Griffin
               Uchida, thought there was at least one occupant in the room.
               Officer Westerman and I responded. As soon as I opened the door
               to the hallway I could smell the odor of marijuana. The odor
               was strongest at the doorway to room 205. I knocked on the door
               and a female voice asked who it was. I said "Ashley" and she
               came to the door. When she opened the door I could see a male
               and another female in the room with her. I could also see both
               windows standing wide open, despite the cold temperatures
               outside. I asked who lived in the room and the female who
               answered the door, Allyison Aahl, stated she lived there alone.
               I asked her if she knew why I was there and she said no. I told
               her that the odor of marijuana was coming from her room. Aahl
               denied having any marijuana. The other occupants were
               identified as Lael L. McDonald and Shay M. Dingfelder. I asked
               them if they had marijuana and they said they did not have
               anything. I could see Dingfelder's eyes were bloodshot and
               watery. I then explained to Aahl the options we had. Aahl still
               denied having any marijuana and told me I could come into her
               room and look. I asked Aahl if they had smoked outside and come
               back into the room. Aahl paused and said that they had been off
               campus, in a vehicle, when they all smoked marijuana. She said
               that she did not have any left and that there was nothing
               illegal in her room. I asked the occupants if they were medical
               marijuana patients and they all said no. I explained to all 3
               occupants that this information would be sent to student
               conduct. They stated they understood. I later downloaded video
               from my Vievu camera to the digital evidence file. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: BRW/325 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0117 SYNOPSIS: RA's reported an
               intoxicated male who ran away from them at Rogers Hall and ran
               towards Stephenson Complex. RA's witnessed the male fall down a
               set of stairs. The male was found and taken into protective
               custody. Charges of MIP Exhibiting will be forwarded to the
               prosecutor. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Omar
               Urbano-Rendon 03/17/96 Protective Custody Intoxication Charges
               Forwarded MIP Exhibiting 2. NARRATIVE: On 01/11/15 at
               approximately 2346 hours I was dispatched to an intoxication
               call in the area of Rogers Hall. The caller who is an RA stated
               an intoxicated male ran from them, fell down some stairs, and
               continued to run towards the Stephenson Complex. Ofc. Edwards
               was first on scene and spoke with the RA. Ofc. Edwards and I
               went out on foot around Stephenson Complex to look for "Omar."
               Omar was described to be Hispanic, around 5'6", thin build, and
               wearing all black. After a few minutes of walking around I
               found a male matching the description of Omar standing near the
               doors that lead to the kitchen of the downunder. When the male
               saw me he started to walk behind some dumpsters towards me.
               Omar was walking slowly and deliberately as if he was
               contemplating each step prior to taking it. Omar appeared to be
               well under the age of 21. I asked Omar, who was later
               identified as Omar Urbano Rendon 03/17/96, what was going on.
               Omar decided to walk past me and I grabbed ahold of the front
               of his shirt and told him to stop. Omar looked as me if he did
               not understand what was going on. I pointed out to Omar that I
               was a Police Officer and told him he was being detained. Omar
               and I were only several inches away from each other and I could
               clearly smell the strong odor of intoxicants coming from him. I
               had Omar sit on the ground so he would not fall over. I told
               Omar that some people had called in about him worried about his
               intoxication level. I asked Omar if he had fallen down and
               tonight and Omar said yes. I asked if he was hurt and Omar said
               no. I asked Omar for his ID and Omar pulled out his wallet.
               Omar removed a McDonald's gift card and a debit card and handed
               it towards me. I pointed out that the McDonald's card was not
               his ID and Omar went back to looking for it. Omar put away the
               McDonalds card and then pulled the McDonalds card back out and
               again tried to hand it to me as his ID. Next Omar handed me a
               debit card and a WSU cougar card. I could see Omar's driver's
               license in the front of his wallet. I bent down and helped Omar
               get his license out. Omar's WADL identified him as 18 years
               old. I asked Omar a series of questions to determine his mental

               status. Omar said the month was February, the day of the week
               was February, and the city he currently was in was January. It
               was clear that Omar was so intoxicated that he was not thinking
               clearly. Omar's words were heavily slurred. I told Omar that I
               would be taking him to the hospital if he could not answer my
               questions correctly. I again asked Omar the same questions
               before. I asked Omar where he currently was and Omar said he
               was at the hospital. I asked Omar what month it was and Omar
               said January. I asked what day of the week it was and Omar said
               January. I told Omar that he was being placed in protective
               custody and I handcuffed (D/L) him. Omar was searched and no
               weapons were found. Ofc. Edwards and I walked Omar to my patrol
               car. While walking to the patrol car Omar was stumbling around
               making it difficult to walk with him. Once at my patrol car I
               asked for medics to respond to take Omar to the hospital. I
               read Omar his Miranda Rights off my department issued card and
               Omar stated he understood his rights. Omar stated he was
               willing to speak with me having his rights in mind. I asked
               Omar what he had been drinking and Omar said he did not know.
               Every question I asked Omar, Omar said "I don't know." The only
               answer I could get out of Omar was that he had been drinking at
               Rogers Hall. I asked Omar if he was willing to provide a PBT
               sample and Omar said he would. I found my PBT (Alco-Sensor FST
               #16805) in working condition. Omar provided a weak sample of
               .172. I told Omar that I would be forwarding charges of MIP
               exhibiting to the Prosecutor. Once medics arrived they
               transported Omar to Pullman Regional Hospital. Once at the
               hospital I fill out the protective custody paperwork and Dr.
               Clark signed it. Once Omar was turned over to the hospital
               staff I cleared. Charges of MIP Exhibiting will be forwarded to
               the Prosecutor. END OF REPORT I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 12th day of
               January, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0118 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched to a
               report of the odor of burning marijuana in Goldsworthy Hall.

               06-1996 Warned Possession of Marijuana 2. NARRATIVE: On 01-11-
               2015 at about 2346 hrs I was dispatched to a report of the odor
               of burning marijuana originating from Goldsworthy Hall #308,
               located at 1455 SE Stadium Way. I arrived on scene and
               contacted several hall staff members in the hallway. I
               approached the door to room #308, and I could detect the odor
               of burning marijuana originating from inside the room. I
               knocked on the door, and it was answered by Collin C. Bates
               (DOB 04-06-1996). Bates is a resident of the room and is 18
               years old. Bates was the only occupant of the room. The odor of
               burning marijuana became stronger when the door to room was
               opened, and I could detect an obvious and strong odor of
               burning marijuana originating from inside the room. Bates
               admitted to smoking marijuana inside the room with a pipe. I
               observed that Bates' eyes appeared to be bloodshot and glazed.
               Upon further investigation, I determined that Bates was in
               possession of a small amount of green vegetable material (GVM)
               in a grinder. The GVM appeared to be marijuana and smelled like
               fresh marijuana. Bates was cooperative, and I explained to him
               that I would not be taking any enforcement action. Bates agreed
               to voluntarily dispose of the GVM in the nearby restroom
               toilet, which he did. I cleared the scene. No further action at
               this time. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this __12__ day of
