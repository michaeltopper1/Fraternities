    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: KDS/326 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0379 SYNOPSIS: Subject dialed 911 and
               was disoriented. Subject was later contacted in the CUB and was
               acting disoriented and confused. Subject was determined to be
               odd and following people around, but not a danger to himself,
               others or property at that point. Also see case 14-W0386
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Derek E. DeLaRosa
               (062894) Contacted Suspicious behavior. 2. NARRATIVE: On 012615
               at approximately 0937 hours, I was dispatched to a report of a
               911 call at the Fine Arts PAT phone. Dispatch advised that
               Derek DeLaRosa was contacted twice by PPD earlier and he had
               called advising he was going to find some water and then go to
               the police department. I responded to the area and Derek had
               left. I checked the Compton Union Building and asked Jessica
               Serio if she had seen a suspicious male in the CUB. Serio
               stated that she did. She told me that he was wearing aviator
               sunglasses and was walking around disoriented and confused. He
               put his jacket down near the TV area and was walking around the
               CUB. Serio took me to the entrance of the Bookie where Derek
               was sitting on a window sill talking to a female. I asked Derek
               what he was doing there and he stated he was waiting for his
               father to come to Pullman from Yakima. Derek stated that he
               didn't know where his dad was or when he was getting to
               Pullman. While talking with Derek, he seemed really relaxed,
               and almost tired. I asked him if he was under the influence of
               alcohol or drugs and he told me he wasn't. He stated he had
               been suspended from school and that he has depression and is
               off his medication. Ofc. Kirshner built a great rapport with
               Derek and continued talking to him. During the contact, Derek
               acted very lethargic, disoriented and confused. He continually
               forgot what he told us, what we told him and where he put his
               belongings, but at the time, he was not considered to be a
               danger to himself, others, or property or gravely disabled.
               Ofc. Kirshner and I remained in the CUB for approximately an
               hour observing him. He regularly walked up to us and engaged us
               in conversation and each time, he introduced himself and asked
               our names. At one point, I saw him take two of his shirts off
               and throw them in the trash. He then wandered around following
               a couple of males he was talking to. I distracted him while the
               males moved along. Derek continued to walk around the CUB and
               CUB staff were going to contact us if he caused further
               problems. We cleared shortly after. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 26th day of

               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 012615
               around 1215 hrs I was dispatched to a report of harassing phone
               calls being received by the complainant, later identified as
               Michael A Stills (042095). Upon contacting Stills he explained
               he has been receiving phone calls from individuals looking for
               someone he believed was names Rico. He went on to tell me he
               does not know anyone named Rico and has had the same phone and
               phone number since sometime in December of 2015. I asked Stills
               what numbers have been calling him looking for Rico and he told
               me a Pullman PD officer, whose name he could not recall, had
               called him around 2127 hrs on 012514. He went to give me a
               phone number of 509-432-6818, which I believed was a phone
               number from one of the Pullman Police Departments vehicles.
               While we continued to speak I asked about the second number he
               had received a phone call from and he gave me a phone number of
               208-892-8638. Again he told me the caller had asked to speak
               with Rico at which point he explained to the caller he did not
               know Rico. After speaking with Stills for a bit longer I asked
               him if he could wait while I checked on a few things. I left
               the room and looked the phone number given to me by Still for
               the Pullman Police Department. I showed the phone was assigned
               to vehicle 16 and I called the Pullman Police Department. Upon
               reaching the front desk and asking about who had been working
               around 2127 hrs on 012515 and driving vehicle 16 was told it
               was most likely Ofc McNannay. They went on to explain the only
               call he was working around that time frame was regarding a cold
               domestic dispute involving Elricco T Jones (081888). As I read
               his narrative I noticed where he had spoken with Stills who had
               told him he did not know Jones. At this point I looked up Jones
               name file in Spillman and also noticed he had a cell phone
               number listed as 509-339-3318, which was Stills phone number.
               After reading this I contacted the second number Stills had
               given me, (208-892-8638), which came back to Fast Cash located
               in Moscow ID. Upon speaking with a representative for Fast Cash
               I learned they had also contacted Still in an attempt to reach
               Jones. I explained what had happened and asked them to remove
               his number from their system, which they told me they had
               already done. I returned to speak with Stills and explained
               what I had learned. We continued to speak and I told him he
               should no longer be receiving any further calls from Fast Cash
               and I had removed the wrong cell phone number listed under

               Warned Possession of Marijuana 2. Sean T. Watungwa (032596)
               Warned Possession/use of Marijuana NARRATIVE: On 012615 at
               approximately 1534 hours, I was dispatched to a report of drugs
               in Goldsworthy Hall room 429. Upon arrival, I smelled a faint
               odor of marijuana coming from room 429. I knocked on the door
               and contacted Jonathon T. Chastain and Sean T. Watungwa who
               were in the room. I asked both to come in the hallway and talk
               to me and both did. When the exited the room, I noticed both
               had extreme bloodshot watery eyes and droopy eyelids. I
               explained to them that I was there because they were smoking
               marijuana in the room. Neither Chastain nor Watungwa denied
               smoking marijuana in the room. I asked Chastain if he was the
               resident of the room and he told me he was. I asked both for
               their identification and Watungwa provided his WADL and
               Chastain identified himself verbally. I asked Watungwa where he
               lived and he stated he lives in room 117 Goldsworthy. I
               explained that there were two options that Chastain had in how
               we could deal with the situation. I told him that option one
               was that he could go retrieve all his smoking devices,
               marijuana and any other illegal substances and we could destroy
               them in the dumpster and they both would be referred to WSU
               Student Conduct. Option two was that I would apply for a search
               warrant for his room and if it was granted, I would seize all
               illegal items from his room and he would be charged criminally
               for anything I located as well as getting referred to WSU
               Student Conduct. Chastain elected for option one and stated
               that he didn't have any more marijuana in the room. I asked him
               how much they smoked and he stated only one bowl and that was
               all the marijuana they had. I asked if each were smoking and
               both admitted to taking hits off the bong. I told him to
               retrieve his smoking devices and other illegal items and meet
               me back in the hallway and he did. I told Watungwa that he was
               free to leave and Chastain retrieved a clear glass bong from
               his room. As we were walking to the elevator, I asked Chastain
               if he had a medical marijuana card and he told me he didn't. I
               escorted him to the dumpster outside Goldsworthy Hall and he
               threw the bong in the dumpster breaking it. As we were walking
               back to the building, I explained that if we get additional
               calls to his room, we may show up to his room with a search

               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE 1. Marcus D. Ulloth 04/26/95 Charges
               Forwarded Poss. of Marijuana with intent to deliver 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 01/26/15 at approximately 2124 hours I was parked
               near Vogel Hall on Johnson Road monitoring traffic on Stadium
               Way when I noticed a black Acura Intregra driving southbound on
               Stadium Way. As the Acura reached Ferdinand's Lane I noticed
               the car was missing it's front license plate. When the Acura
               reached my location I saw the male driver holding a cell phone
               in his left hand. The male, later identified as Marcus Deandre
               Ulloth 04/26/95, was using his thumb to type a text message. I
               was able to clearly see the cell phone because the phone was a
               smart phone with an illuminated touch screen. I pulled behind
               the Acura and initiated a traffic stop at Stadium Way and
               Grimes Way. The Acura pulled into the CUE parking lot and came
               to a stop. I contacted Ulloth, identified myself, informed
               Ulloth I was recording and explained the reason for the stop.
               Ulloth said his license plate was underneath his bumper. I
               walked to the front of Ulloth's car and bent down to look for
               it. I found Ulloth's license plate approximately 8 inches
               behind the lower section of his bumper and grill. The license
               plate had been cut down to a smaller size. Due to the license
               plate being behind the bumper and grill it was almost
               noticeable unless you were looking straight into the bumper
               from ground level. I asked Ulloth about driving and texting and
               Ulloth said he was just replying to his mother really quick. I
               asked for Ulloth's driver's license and he said it was in his
               backpack behind his seat. Ulloth turned around and grabbed his
               backpack. From his backpack Ulloth grabbed his wallet and
               handed me his WADL. I asked for Ulloth's vehicle registration
               and proof of insurance. Ulloth opened the glove box with his
               backpack still in his lap. Every time Ulloth moved I would get
               a whiff of fresh marijuana. I believed there to be marijuana in
               his backpack since I smelled it once he grabbed his bag. I
               asked Ulloth how much marijuana was in his car. Ulloth did not
               answer. I asked Ulloth if he had a medical marijuana card and
               Ulloth said he did not. I minimized the situation by saying,
               "we are not talking about pounds (marijuana) are we." Ulloth
               said no. I asked Ulloth, "can I see how much you have." Ulloth
               grabbed a sandwich bag of marijuana from the front pocket of
               his sweatshirt and handed it to me. Ulloth said, "it's just a
               dime sir, I just went and got it from my friend." I asked

               Ulloth if he had any more drugs in the car and Ulloth said he
               did not. About this time Sgt. Jacobson arrived on scene. I told
               Ulloth as long as he has not been contacted for drugs before I
               was going to just write him a citation. Ulloth replied, "If you
               need to check my bag or anything like that go ahead." I told
               Ulloth that I would like to ask for his consent to search his
               car. I told Ulloth before he answered I wanted to notify him of
               his Ferrier Warnings. After the Warnings Ulloth said, "if you
               want." I told Ulloth that I need a more decisive answer such as
               yes or no. Ulloth said, "yes sir that's fine sir." I had Ulloth
               exit his car and stand on the sidewalk with Sgt. Jacobson.
               Ulloth was standing a few feet away from his car so he could
               revoke his consent at anytime. During the search of the car I
               located a small tupperware container with **** individually
               wrapped squares of what I instantly recognized as "wax" also
               known as hash oil which is a controlled substance. Each
               individual square had two small rubber bands on it and "1 gram"
               written on it. I found nothing else illegal during the search.
               I read Ulloth his Miranda Rights off my department issued card.
               Ulloth stated he understood his rights and having them in mind
               he still wished to speak with me. I also told Ulloth that he
               was being audio and video recorded. I told Ulloth based on how
               the hash oil was packaged and weighed out it looks as if he was
               selling. Ulloth said, "I did have intent to sell." Ulloth said
               he was not going to school and no longer wanted to work as a
               custodian so Ulloth went to Spokane, WA and bought the drugs so
               he could sell it and make some money. Ulloth was being very
               honest and forthcoming with me and I told Ulloth because of his
               respectful and honest behavior I would not be placing him under
               arrest at this moment. I told Ulloth that I would be sending
               charges of possession of marijuana with intent to deliver to
               the prosecutor. I told Ulloth that intent to deliver a
               controlled substance was a felony. Ulloth stated he understood.
               I told Ulloth that he was free to go and I cleared. Once back
               at the station the marijuana and hash oil NIC test presumptive
               positive for cannabis. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this ____ day of

    Narrative: RVWD: AE/330 OFC: BRW/325 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0393 SYNOPSIS: Report of a car outside
               the B Building of Chinook Village playing loud bass music.
               Unable to locate. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 01/27/15 at approximately 0130 hours I was
               dispatched to a noise complaint in the parking lot area of
               Chinook Village. The caller stated that there was a car in the
               parking lot near the B building playing loud bass music. The
               caller could not see the car so they were unable to provide a
               description. Cpl. Edwards and I responded to the area and found
               no sources of music. We cleared shortly thereafter. END OF
