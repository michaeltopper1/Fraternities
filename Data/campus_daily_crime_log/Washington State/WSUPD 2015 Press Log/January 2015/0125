               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0366 SYNOPSIS: A case number was
               generated for the WSU v Colorado Women's basketball game at
               Beasley Coliseum. There was no one ejected from the basketball
               game. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               012515 at about 1123hrs, a case number was generated for the
               WSU v Colorado Women's basketball game at Beasley Coloseum.
               There was no one ejected from the game. However, I received a
               phone call at 1533hrs from the Director of the Coliseum, Leo
               Udy, about a verbal confrontation that occurred between
               StaffPro (Adam Dangerfield) attempting to give a WSU fan,
               Mitchell Nelson, some directions about where he (the fan) was
               allowed to stand around section six on the basketball floor.
               The situation was diffused by a WSU Athletics Events employee,
               but Nelson went away very angry. Udy called Ben Clarke of WSU
               Athletics to inform him of the situation. I had noticed during
               half-time that Nelson went from his seating area (section
               4)over to section 13 to visit with someone. Then he went down
               to the basketball floor in the isle between section 12 and 13,
               stood behind the WSU team bench and then walked on the
               basketball floor back over to his seat in section 4. He has
               been told by the WSU Athletic Department not to walk on the
               floor (other than right in front of his assigned seat). I
               notified StaffPro and WSU Events employee Gregory Testa, to be
               aware that Nelson was had been on the floor and behind the WSU
               team bench. Nothing further at this time. MFL/313 I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               approximately 1119 hours, Miguel A. Garcia (10-29-92) called
               Whitcom reporting two of his apartment window screens were
               damaged sometime after 0200 hours on 01-25-15. I responded to
               Garcia's apartment (Terrace, 703) and contacted him. He showed
               me the two screens which had both been torn. He said his wife
               told him there was a lot of foot traffic on Merman Drive prior
               to her going to be on 01-25-15, but also said she did not see
               or hear anyone near the apartment. Garcia said he got in around

               screens. He noticed the damage when he woke up and called
               Whitcom. I took photographs of the damaged screens and gave
               Garcia my business card with his Police case number on it. I
               asked him to contact me if he determined who may have damaged
               his screens. There were no fingerprints on the window. Once
               back at the Police Department, I downloaded the photographs
               onto the WSU Police Computer System. No suspects or leads. I

               male on the south side of Bryan Hall that was standing near the
               trees, looking into the sky and possibly had a handgun. Subject
               contacted and it was determined that he was not armed and was

               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Ezsaisa K. Szentkiralyi/04-28-74 Detained 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 01-25-15 at about 2129 hours I was dispatched to
               the report of a suspicious male on the south side of Bryan
               Hall, standing near the trees looking up at the sky who
               possibly had a handgun. The RP, Shane C. Hopkins, reported to
               Whitcom that he was walking near Bryan Hall when he saw a white
               male wearing a hooded sweatshirt, jeans, dark gloves and was
               possibly holding a handgun. The RP also said that he saw a dark
               bag on the bench near the male. Hopkins stated that the male
               was looking up at the sky. Sgt. Jacobsen, Officer Olmstead,
               Officer Westerman and I responded. We watched the male for
               several minutes, pacing around the south side of Bryan Hall
               near the trees and bench. He would often stop and look up at
               the sky. I was too far away to see if he had a weapon in his
               hands. I watched as he went near the bench, shuffled through a
               bag, then stood back up and walked back to the trees. He then
               went back to the bench, sat down, and stretched both arms out
               to his sides. He did not appear to be holding anything. He then
               stood up, grabbed a bag in each hand, then started to walk
               southbound on Library Road. At this time I could see that he
               did not have a weapon in either hand and Officer Olmstead and I
               contacted the subject, ordering him to put his hands up and get
               on the ground. He complied with all of our orders. While we
               were handcuffing the male he told us he was visually and
               hearing impaired. He was frisked for weapons, none were found.
               He assisted the male to his feet and had him sit on a nearby
               bench. We asked if he was hurt or injured from being on the
               ground and he said no. The male was identified as Ezsaias K.
               Szentkiralyi. He said that he did not have any weapons and was
               out looking at the stars. He said he was walking around to try
               and find the best view. Szentkiralyi gave Ofc. Westerman
               consent to search his two bags for weapons, none were found. He
               told us he was on his way to the library. Szentkiralyi said
               that he has a car that he keeps in a church parking lot but
               does not have a permanent residence. Szentkiralyi was polite
               and cooperative throughout our contact with him. Because of the
               nature of the call, Sgt. Jacobsen advised Chief Gardner via
               voicemail and Assistant Chief Hansen via phone. Nothing

               2203 hours I was dispatched to the report of drugs at Streit
               Hall room 208. The RP, Michael A. Hoodless, is the Hall
               Director at Streit/Perham and called advising that he could
               smell the odor of marijuana emitting from room 208. Officer
               Olmstead and I responded. As I walked down the hallway towards
               room 208 I could smell the odor of burnt marijuana become
               stronger. I stopped at room 208 and put my nose to the crack of
               the door. I could smell a very strong odor of burnt marijuana
               emitting from the room. I listened for a minute and could hear
               at least two male voices inside the room. Room 208 is a single
               occupancy room with Christopher J. Larsen as the assigned
               resident. I knocked on the door and could immediately hear
               shuffling around inside the room. I knocked again and I could
               hear an aerosol can being sprayed for several seconds. I waited
               and knocked a third time. I could still hear voices inside the
               room, the volume on the tv change and shuffling around. The
               name "Chris" was on the door so I asked "Chris" to come to the
               door. Nobody from within the room said anything to me and
               nobody would come to the door. I tried several more times to
               make contact with the occupants without success. Hoodless
               identified Christopher J. Larsen as being the sole occupant and
               advised that he nor the RA's knew whoelse was in the room. Case
               forwarded to student conduct. I certify and declare under

               CASE #: 15-W0377 SYNOPSIS: Report of a 911 call. Subject
               determined to be fine. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               2. NARRATIVE: On 01-26-15 at about 0043 hours I was dispatched
               to a communications problem. Whitcom advised that a female
               caller identified as "Betty" called 911 and said she missed a
               call from "911" and was just returned their call. Whitcom
               stated that they checked their records and nobody had called
               "Betty" at "206-832-7447". The caller stated she was at
               Stephenson but did not identify where. The dispatcher told me
               that the caller was not making very much sense. It was
               determined that the caller was Betheal T. Kibreab/09-29-95 and
               she resides at Stephenson North 809. Officer Westerman and I
               responded to that room. On the door there was a name tag for
               "Betty". I knocked on the door and a female answered. I asked
               if she was "Betty" and she said yes. I asked her if everything
               was ok and she said it was and she was just returning a missed
               phone call. She said she did not know why "911" would have
               called her. She showed her phone to me and I could see a missed
               call from "Emergency Number 911" at about 0026 hours. There was
               no message left. As I spoke to Kibreab she did not appear to be
               in distress or under the influence of drugs or alcohol. It is
               unknown who was trying to call Kibreab or why it showed up as
               911. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 26th day of January,
               2015, in Pullman, Washington.
