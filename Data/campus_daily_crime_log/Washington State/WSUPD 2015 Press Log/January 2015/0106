    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: JAK/333 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0040 SYNOPSIS: Bailey L. Barker (12-31-
               95), said her vehicle is a victim of a Hit and Run accident.
               She said it occurred between the hours of 1900 and 2030 hours
               on 12-09-14, while it was parked in the front parking lot at
               Streit & Perham Hall. Barker has no suspect vehicle
               information. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 01-06-15, Bailey L. Barker (12-31-95) called
               Whitcom wanting to speak with an Officer regarding a cold Hit
               and Run vehicle accident. She asked to have a WSU Police
               Officer contact her via phone. I contacted Barker and asked her
               what I could do for her. She said her vehicle was the victim of
               a Hit and Run accident which occurred on 12-09-14. I asked her
               why she waited until now to report the incident and she said
               she was not initially going to file a report because she saw
               very little; if any, damage to her car. She said she spoke with
               her father regarding the Hit and Run and they are now working
               with their insurance company. She said they were now going to
               have to replace the entire front bumper of her car. I asked her
               when and where the Hit and Run occurred. She said she parked
               her car in the parking lot in front of Streit and Perham Hall
               between 1900 and 1930 hours on 12-09-14. She said she went
               inside to change clothes as she was going to go to a friend's
               house. She came back to her car between the hours of 2000 and
               2030 hours on 21-09-14. She said she realized her car had been
               hit while she was inside, but didn't think there was much
               damage to it so she did not call the Police. I asked her if she
               was in Pullman so I could take photos of the damage to her car.
               She said she was in Spokane at the Dentist and would not be
               back in Pullman until sometime on Sunday, 01-11-14. I asked her
               if she had taken photos of the damage to her car and she said
               she had. I asked her if she could e-mail the photos to me so I
               could include them in the case file. She said she could and
               would when she was finished at the Dentist office. I gave her
               my e-mail address as well as her Police Case Number. More to
               follow. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 6th day of January, 2015, in Pullman,
