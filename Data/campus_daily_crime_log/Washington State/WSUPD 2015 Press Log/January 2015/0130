               document medication that was turned in for destruction.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               01/30/15 Eliana Rodriquez came to WSU PD and advised that her
               doctor had changed her prescription and she would like to turn
               in her unused prescription medication. I advised that Pullman
               PD had a medication drop box but if it was inconvenient to take
               it to Pullman PD that I could log it in to our property and
               destroy it when we take evidence to the incinerator. Rodriquez
               wanted to turn it in to WSU PD. I filled out a found property
               form check in sheet since we do not have any other form for
               this procedure. Rodriquez signed the top of the form but I did
               not take any of her other information since you can anonymously
               turn in prescription medication. I took 3 bottles of
               medication. One was Spironolact, the 2nd was Sulfa/Trim DS, and
               the 3rd was a prescription bottle with the information removed.
               Kate Vines was present when Rodriquez turned in the medication.
               I took it immediately to package it and had Deanne Anderson
               witness me place all three prescription bottles in a plastic
               evidence bag and we both signed the seal. I placed the evidence
               bag with the medication into the evidence room into incinerator
               box #19 for destruction. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 30th day of January,

               trusses were stolen from the CUB storage room. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 01-30-15 at
               approximately 1330 hours Officer Jones and I were dispatched to
               the CUB Information Desk to take a theft report. Ofc. Jones and
               I met with CUB employee Spencer M. Desmarais (06-15-90) who was
               reporting the theft. Desmarais told us they went to the CUB
               room 240 on 01-23-15 to use the three (3) triangle trusses they
               had stored up there, but realized they were no longer there.
               Desmarais said the crank stands that support the trusses are
               still in the storage room and nothing else appears to be
               missing from the room. Desmarais said him and other employees
               looked all over thinking maybe they were misplaced, but they
               were unable to find any of them. Desmarais said all of the
               employees are experienced enough to know the trusses are kept
               in the storage room. Desmarais mentioned the triangle trusses
               were last used and seen on December 13, 2014. Desmarais said
               there He said each one of the trusses is approximately 10 feet
               long and the value for all of them is about $800 to $1000. Ofc.
               Jones asked him if there were any distinguishing marks or brand
               names on the trusses which would make them unique and Desmarias
               said no. Desmarias did say the ends were marked with either
               yellow or orange elctrical tape. Desmarias also said there was
               a lot of Black Gaffers Tape around the trusses. Desmarias did
               say there may be some tape residue left on them. Desmarais said
               CUB room 240 is locked at all times and the keys for it are
               held by CUB custodial and operations full-time employees.
               Desmarais also said there are a few sets of CUB room 240 keys
               which are kept in CUB room L3 for student employees to use
               during their shifts. Desmarais told us room L3 uses a card
               swipe to gain access and when he looked at the door access logs
               for room L3 there was one that stood out as being odd to him.
               Desmarais took us to CUB room 240 and showed us where the
               tirangle trusses are normally stored. Desmarias also mentioned
               he heard Phi Kappa Tau Fraternity (PKT) just recently installed
               triangle trusses in their fraternity. **Report not finished** I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of

               alarm at the Washington Building. Entered and found one male
               subject. We identified the male and determined he was
               authorized to be in the building, the alarm was set without
               knowing he was still in the building. Employee error. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 01/30/15 at
               about 1837 hours I was dispatched to a burglary alarm at the
               Washington building. Officer Petlovany and Officer Olmstead
               also responded. We made entry into the building through the
               west entrance and began to clear the building. While searching
               the south side of the first floor, I heard a voice down the
               hall near the southwest corner of the building. I announced,
               WSU Police Department come out with your hands up. A male came
               out into the hallway with his hands up. I asked if he was
               supposed to be in the building. He said he worked in the
               building and believed the person who set the alarm did not
               realize he was still in the building. I asked if I could see
               his driver's license and he gave it to Officer Petlovany. The
               male was identified as John A. Horstkamp (062660) a physician
               for WSU Health and Wellness located in the Washington Building.
               Horstkamp entered the code into the alarm panel to deactivate
               the alarm. We continued a walk through of the building.
               Horstkamp left the building, and we reset the alarm as we left.
               All units cleared. Employee error. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 30th day of

               Nelson, Kathleen A./080548 Infraction issued Fail yield to ped
               in crosswalk 2. NARRATIVE: On 01/30/15 at about 1946 hours I
               responded to a vehicle verse pedestrian collision near the
               corner of Stadium Way and Spokane St. When I arrived on scene
               there was a female sitting in the back seat of a vehicle with
               the door open. The driver, Kathleen A. Nelson (080548), and a
               male were also on scene. The female in the back seat of the
               vehicle, Monica Tecson Lopez (071886) was saying she was having
               pain in her right knee. I spoke to the male, Mihaimuan S. Silva
               (060292). He said he was walking in the crosswalk on Stadium
               Way near Spokane St. with Lopez when Nelson struck both of
               them. They were crossing from the south side of Stadium way to
               the north side. Lopez and Silva were in the north most lane of
               Stadium Way and were almost to the sidewalk when they were
               struck. Nelson was driving her vehicle (WA/AAZ8246) west on
               Stadium Way in the far right lane of her direction of travel
               when she saw the two in the crosswalk. She said she applied her
               brakes and attempt to change lanes in order to avoid striking
               the pedestrians. Nelson stated she did strike Lopez but thought
               that Lopez had then struck and knocked down Silva. Lopez said
               she heard Nelson's vehicle braking and begin to skid just
               before her and Silva were struck. Lopez was evaluated at the
               scene by Pullman Fire Dept. She sustained an injury to her
               right knee but refused transport to the hospital. The roadway
               was wet from a snow rain mixture falling at the time of the
               collision. I exchanged information between the two parties and
               issued Nelson a notice of infraction for Failure to yield to a
               pedestrian in a crosswalk. I completed a PTCR of the collision.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury

               on Library Road when I saw a college age male, later identified
               as Kevin J. Cote, walking south. He was stumbling and walking
               side to side. At one pointing he almost walked into a cement
               planter. Fearing he was going to fall I stopped and exited my
               patrol car. I asked Cote to stop and if he was ok. Whe he
               looked at me I saw that he was clearly under 21 years of age.
               He mumbled something that I couldn't understand. He stopped,
               faced me, and asked why I was stopping him. I told him that I
               was fearing for his safety. I ask him if he had been drinking
               and he said he haddn't. I could smell a very strong odor of
               intoxicating beverages coming from his breath as he spoke. As
               he was standing there he was swaying side to side. I again
               asked him how much he had to drink. He denied having anything.
               I asked him if he would be willing to provide a breath sample
               and he said he didn't want to. I asked him for his
               identfication and he provided a Minnisota Drivers License. The
               license confirmed he was under 21 years of age. Dispatched
               confirmed that the license was valid. I asked if I could check
               his eyes and he agreed. I administered a horizontal gaze
               nystagmus test on her. I observed he had bloodshot and watery
               eyes, a lack of smooth pursuit, and a distinct and sustained
               nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes. I told he was
               under arrest for MIP-Exhibiting. I told him I would be
               forwarding charges to the Whitman County Prosecutor and Student
               conduct. He began to argue with me about why I was speaking to
               him. I told him again that I was fearing for his safety and
               then discovered he had been drinking. He again denied the
               allegation. I asked him if he wanted a ride home and he said he
               didn't. I told him he was free to leave and handed him his
               identification. The last I saw him he was walking south on
               Library Road. Nothing further........... I certify and declare

               had a very strong odor of alcohol emitting off of him and when
               he spoke the odor became stronger. Goakey was able to answer my
               questions about where he was, where he lived, and what he had

               vomit on the floor in front of him. He admitted to having
               several alcoholic drinks throughout the evening. Medics arrived
               and evaluated Goakey, he was cleared medically and the RA
               stated she would assist Goakey back to his room on the 12th
