               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0477 01-31-15 SYNOPSIS: Property damage
               reported in Northside Residence Hall fifth floor, hole in wall.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 01-31-
               15 at approximately 1346 hours Officer Jones and I were
               dispatched to property damage at the Northside Residence Hall
               fifth floor. Ofc. Jones and I contacted the RP, Colby B.P.
               Cavanaugh (06-07-94) who took us to the fifth floor to show us
               were the damage occurred. As soon as the elevator got to the
               fifth floor Cavanaugh directed us towards the wall immediately
               to the left once we exited the elevator.I could see the room
               502 Study Lounge and I could see the right side of the wall had
               been idented by something. The damage was approximately 2 feet
               long and 2 feet wide. I estimated the approximate value of the
               damgage to be $500. I took photographs of the damage to the
               wall. Cavanaugh thinks the damage occurred sometime after 2300
               hours on 01-30-15 because he is the 5th floor RA at Northside
               and was doing floor rounds around 2300 hours and did not see
               the damage then. Cavanaugh did say a little later about 2330 or
               2345 hours he heard what sounded like wrestling down the
               hallway. Cavanaugh opened his dorm room door and looked down
               the hall and could see two people standing by the wall that was
               damaged who he thought were WSU football players, but he was
               not sure and a few others who appeared to be watching the two
               by the wall. Cavanaugh said he did not think anything of it at
               the time. On 01-31-15 at approximately 1245 hours Cavanaugh
               said he noticed the wall had been damaged. Cavanaugh said he
               then thought the damage occurred by the two guys he thought he
               heard wrestling in the hallway on 01-30-15. Cavanaugh said he
               later heard someone in the hallway say "he was heated" and
               appear to take a picture of the damage of the wall with his
               cell phone. Cavanaugh said he spoke with him and he said he did
               not know he did it. Cavanaugh talked with Cavanaugh said
               Housing had been contacted and are going to come out and fix
               the damage. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury

    Narrative: RVWD:MJG/309 / OFC: BRW/325 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0487 SYNOPSIS: An RA reported a fire
               extinguisher stolen from the 3rd floor hallway of Northside
               Hall. No suspects. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 02/01/15 at approximately 0113 hours, I was
               dispatched to a theft call at Northside Hall. Dispatch stated
               an RA called and wanted to report a fire extinguisher that had
               been stolen from the 3rd floor of Northside Hall. The RA told
               dispatch that the theft took place between 2300 to 0110 hours.
               The RA stated they did not need contact from me. I responded to
               Northside and found the fire extinguisher housing next to room
               349 which is a study room. The fire extinguisher was gone and
               the housing was not damaged since it uses a magnetic system to
               keep it closed. I took photos of the fire extinguisher housing
               which were uploaded to the files folder. I searched the
               surrounding area and found no signs of a fire extinguisher
               being set off. All other fire extinguishers on the 3rd floor
               were accounted for. Unable to find the stolen fire
               extinguisher, I cleared. END OF REPORT. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               1st day of February, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Megan E Lagerberg 10/24/95 Charges
               Forwarded MIP Exhibiting 2. NARRATIVE: On 02/01/15 at
               approximately 0158 hours I was stopped at a red light facing
               westbound on Stadium Way at the intersection of Nevada Street.
               There were two vehicles facing eastbound on Stadium Way also
               waiting for the light to turn green. About this time a female,
               later identified as Megan Elizabeth Lagerberg 10/24/95, hit the
               button to cross the street. Lagerberg was standing on the
               northwest corner of the intersection. The light turned green
               for east and west traffic to precede. I started into the
               intersection but immediately had to hit my breaks because
               Lagerberg stepped off the sidewalk and started crossing the
               street. Lagerberg's crossing signal told her not to cross.
               Lagerberg crossed all four lanes of traffic illegally causing
               the two westbound cars and I to wait for her when we had the
               right of way. As soon as Lagerberg reached the other side of
               the street I turned on my emergency lights to contact her for
               the traffic violation. I stopped at the curb and exited my car
               as Lagerberg was continuing to walk away from me. Lagerberg was
               walking towards the Stephenson Complex. I yelled to Lagerberg
               that I needed to talk with her but Lagerberg continued to walk
               away from me. I ran up to Lagerberg and had her stop. I asked
               Lagerberg if she had heard me yelling after her and she said
               no. I told Lagerberg that she walking in front of all the cars
               that had a green light and Lagerberg said, "oh." I asked for
               Lagerberg's ID and she provided her WSU Cougar Card. I asked
               Lagerberg for her date of birth which she provided verbally. As
               Lagerberg spoke I could smell the strong odor of intoxicants
               coming from her breath. Lagerberg identified herself as 19
               years old. Due to Lagerberg being under the age of 21 and the
               odor of intoxicants coming from her breath I asked Lagerberg if
               I could look at her eyes. Lagerberg said I could. I told
               Lagerberg to follow the tip of my pen with her eyes only and
               not to move her head. Lagerberg nodded her head in agreement.
               During the HGN test I observed, equal pupil size, equal
               tracking, lack of smooth pursuit, and distinct and sustained
               nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes. Lagerberg's eyes
               were bloodshot and watery. During the test Lagerberg was
               swaying in a side to side motion. I asked Lagerberg how much
               she had to drink and she said, "not a lot." I asked how much
               that was a Lagerberg said, "2 cups." I asked Lagerberg if that

               meant they were mixed drinks and Lagerberg said 2 shots. I
               asked Lagerberg if she was willing to do a voluntary portable
               breath test. Lagerberg said she would provide a sample. I found
               my PBT (Alco-Sensor FST #16805) in working condition. I
               explained to Lagerberg how to provide a proper sample. The
               first two times Lagerberg tired to provide a sample she was
               barely blowing causing an insufficient flow error. On
               Lagerberg's third attempt I manually captured a sample after
               approximately one second. Lagerberg provided a very weak sample
               of .151. Based on my experience I would put Lagerberg's BAC in
               the area of .180 to .200. I told Lagerberg that I would be
               forwarding charges of MIP Exhibiting to the prosecutor. I also
               told Lagerberg that if she was underage and out in public after
               drinking, it was not a wise decision to draw attention to
               herself by walking in front of vehicles that had the right of
               way. I told Lagerberg that she was free to go and I cleared.
               END OF REPORT I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 1st day of February, 2015, in

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0489 SYNOPSIS: Ozmun cited and released
               for DUI. BAC .219 and .218 NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR#
               1. Emily Ann Ozmun 06/13/91 Cited/Released DUI 5Z0236224 2.
               NARRATIVE: On February 1, 2015 at approximately 0217 hours I
               was driving eastbound on Cougar Way approaching D St when I
               noticed a silver Chevrolet SUV traveling southbound on D St.
               The SUV came to a stop at the stop sign before turning right
               onto Colorado St. The SUV turned so wide that it fully turned
               into the oncoming lane of travel's turn lane. The SUV slowly
               wandered back into its lane heading westbound. I turned around
               a caught up to the SUV at Colorado St and C St. The SUV slowed
               as if it was going to turn onto C St. At the last possible
               moment the SUV jerked to the right and turned down C St. The
               driver did not use their turn signal. I activated my emergency
               lights and the SUV came to a stop at C St and the Cougar Tower
               Apartments. I walked up to the driver's side window and noticed
               a female driver who was just staring straight ahead. After
               about three second I knocked on the window to get the driver's
               attention. The driver tried to roll the window down but instead
               hit the door lock button. Once the driver rolled down the
               window I spoke with the driver, Emily Ann Ozmun 06/13/91,
               identified myself, informed the driver I was recording, and
               explained the reason for the stop. While explaining what I had
               observed I noticed Ozmun holding her driver's license in her
               hand. I asked Ozmun for her license. When Ozmun went to hand me
               the license she dropped it which fell into her lap. I asked for
               Ozmun driver's license, proof of insurance, and vehicle
               registration. As Ozmun was looking for her items, Ozmun's
               movements were slow and deliberate. I could smell the strong
               odor of intoxicants coming from within the car. As Ozmun handed
               me her information I noticed that Ozmun's eyes were bloodshot
               and her eyelids were droopy. I asked Ozmun if I could talk to
               her outside of the car. Ozmun said that was fine. Ozmun was
               wearing a black leather coat with a purse over the top of that.
               Ozmun struggled to take her purse off for several seconds
               before taking her coat off. Ozmun was unable to get the purse
               strap off her shoulder without entangling it with her coat. I
               asked Ozmun if she wanted her coat because it was cold out and
               Ozmun said it was fine. Ozmun was wearing a black tank top,
               jeans, and tennis shoes. It was approximately 30 degrees
               outside. I asked Ozmun if she was willing to do some voluntary
               standardized field sobriety tests. Ozmun stated she would. The
               tests were conducted on a level and paved parking lot of the

               Cougar Towers. The parking lot was lit by street lights, patrol
               car spot light, and personal flashlight. I explained to Ozmun
               that I would be evaluating her on how well she followed my
               instructions as well as how well she performed the tests. About
               this time Cpl. Edwards arrived on scene. The first test I
               administered was the HGN test. I instructed Ozmun to stand with
               her heels and toes together and keep her arms at her sides. I
               told Ozmun to remain in that position while I administered the
               test. Ozmun stated she understood. I told Ozmun to follow the
               tip of my pen with her eyes only and not to move her head. I
               held my pen approximately 12-15 inches away from Ozmun's head.
               During the test I observed, equal pupil size, equal tracking,
               lack of smooth pursuit, distinct and sustained nystagmus at
               maximum deviation, onset of nystagmus prior to 45 degrees in
               both eyes, and vertical nystagmus. Ozmun was swaying in a side
               to side motion during the test. I could smell the overpowering
               odor of intoxicants coming from Ozmun's breath as she stood
               before me. The next test I administered was the walk and turn.
               I told Ozmun to place her left foot on an imaginary line before
               her. I then instructed Ozmun to place her right foot heel to
               toe in front of her left foot and keep her arms at her side.
               Ozmun attempted to get into the starting position but her feet
               were not in a line. When I corrected Ozmun she placed her right
               foot pointing to the right at a 45 degree angle away from her
               left foot. Ozmun kept shuffling her feet turning towards the
               right as she did so, to keep her balance. When Ozmun stopped
               moving she was now facing away from me at a 90 degree angle. I
               asked Ozmun to turn and face me so she could see what I was
               showing her. I told Ozmun, when I tell you to begin, don't
               begin until I tell you, you will take a series of nine heel to
               toe steps down the line, with your arms at your side, looking
               down at your feet, and counting your steps out loud. Once you
               reach your ninth step leave your lead foot planted and with
               your rear foot take a series of small steps until you are
               facing where you came from and again take nine return heel to
               toe steps. I started to demonstrate the test for Ozmun and she
               started the test. I told Ozmun to hold on but Ozmun continued
               to take her 9 steps. I told Ozmun that I was not done
               explaining the test and asked her to come back. Once Ozmun
               returned from where she started, Ozmun stood with her feet
               approximately shoulder length apart. I again told Ozmun not to
               start the test until I instructed her to do so. I demonstrated
               the test again and reminded Ozmun to keep her arms at her side,
               count her steps out loud, look down at her feet, and do not
               stop the test until she had completed it. I asked Ozmun if she
               understood and Ozmun said she did. I asked Ozmun if she would
               like me to demonstrate the test again and she said no. I told
               Ozmun she could begin as soon as she was ready. First Nine
               Steps: Ozmun stepped off line on step 2 and 3. From step 4 to
               step 9 Ozmun missed heel to toe because she started to walk in
               a normal fashion instead of attempting heel to toe. When Ozmun
               reached her 9th step she incorrectly turned by spinning around
               on her left foot causing her to lose her balance and stumble
               backwards. Return Nine Steps: Ozmun again missed heel to toe on
               every step on her return steps. The next test I administered

               was the One Leg Stand. I instructed Ozmun to stand with her
               heels and toes together and keep her arms at her side. I told
               Ozmun to remain in that position while I gave her further
               instructions. I told Ozmun, when I tell you to begin, don't
               begin until I tell you, you will raise either leg of your
               choice and raise it six inches off the ground. You must point
               your toe so the sole of your shoe is parallel with the ground.
               While pointing your toe, keep your arms at your side, leg
               straight, look down at your foot and count out loud, one
               thousand one, one thousand two, one thousand three, and so on
               until I tell you to stop. I demonstrated the test as I
               explained the test. I asked Ozmun if she had any questions
               regarding the test and Ozmun said she was cold. I asked Ozmun
               if she wanted me to see if we could get her jacket and she said
               yes. Cpl. Edwards retrieved Ozmun's jacket and Ozmun put it
               back on. I asked Ozmun if she would like me to explain or
               demonstrate the one leg stand test again. Ozmun asked if I was
               "going to take her in." I told Ozmun that was dependant on my
               evaluation of the standardized field sobriety tests. I again
               asked Ozmun if she was willing to do the test and Ozmun said
               she needed a minute. I told Ozmun to tell me when she was
               ready. After about a minute I asked for a third time if she was
               willing to do the test and Ozmun said she would do it. I
               explained and demonstrated the test again since it had been a
               while since my last demonstration. I told Ozmun to begin. Ozmun
               raised her right leg and began the test. Ozmun counted to 1003
               before she lost her balance and stumbled to her left, putting
               her foot down. Ozmun raised her leg again and started counting
               from 1001. Ozmun counted to 1004 before losing her balance and
               putting her foot down. Ozmun raised her foot and again started
               counting from 1001. Ozmun counted to 1007 before losing balance
               and putting her foot down. I told Ozmun to stop. During the
               test Ozmun had her hands in front of her with her fingers
               interlocked. I told Ozmun that the last test I had for her was
               the PBT. I explained what the PBT was, that it was voluntary,
               and it did not replace the evidentiary breath test. Ozmun
               stated she did not want to provide a sample. I told Ozmun that
               she was under arrest for DUI and handcuffed (D/L) her. I
               advised Ozmun that she was being audio and video recorded. I
               searched Ozmun incident to arrest and nothing of evidentiary
               value was found. I read Ozmun her Miranda Rights off my
               department issued card. I told Ozmun that the vehicle was going
               to be towed and wanted to know if there was anything in the car
               she wanted out of it. Ozmun stated she wanted her wallet. Cpl.
               Edwards stayed with the vehicle and I transported Ozmun to
               Pullman Police Department for BAC. Upon arrival I checked the
               Datamaster and found it working properly, with the RFI antenna
               attached, the mouth tube warm to the touch, and a temperature
               within ranges. I read Ozmun her Constitutional Rights at 0251
               hours. Ozmun stated she understood her rights and signed she
               understood her rights and decided not to exercise her rights.
               At 0251 hours I checked Ozmun's mouth finding no foreign
               substances. I read Ozmun the Implied Consent Warning for Breath
               and Ozmun signed that it had been read to her at 0254 hours.
               Ozmun stated she was willing to provide a breath sample. Ozmun
