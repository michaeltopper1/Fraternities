    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: JAK/333 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0351 SYNOPSIS: Joseph T. Paul (03-14-91)
               called Whitcom stating one of his employees witnessed 4 white
               males near one of the construction sites taking things out of a
               construction container and putting them into their back packs.
               The males were not identified and it is unknown if anything was
               actually taken. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: I responded to the BNB Builders construction site
               near the intersection of Wilson Road Extension and Animal
               Sciences Road where I met Joseph T. Paul (03-14-91). Paul had
               another one of his workers there with him, Anthony W. Wilson
               (05-10-65). Wilson was the one who saw 4 males near a
               construction container which sits on top of the hill directly
               across from the BNB site. Wilson said he was working on the
               roof of the green house which is under construction on Wilson
               Road. He saw 4 white males near the construction container and
               said they appeared to have put things into their backpacks. He
               described the males as being white and in their mid 20's. He
               said one of them was wearing a dark green jacket, one a blue
               zip up hoodie, one a red jacket, and the other a jacket with
               gray and black horizontal stripes on it. He said they all had
               backpacks which appeared to be heavy by the way they were
               holding the back packs. He said he got down off of the green
               house roof and began walking in the direction of the males. He
               said as he got closer to them he believes they saw him as they
               began running toward the BNB construction site. Wilson walked
               into the BNB construction site and saw the males "Hiding"
               behind a construction container. Wilson said the males took off
               running toward the WSU Student Recreation Center. I gave my
               business card to both Wilson and Paul and asked them to call me
               if they determined what; if anything, had been taken from the
               site. I left and drove to the area of the Air Supported
               Structure (ASS) as WSU was hosting an indoor track meet. I
               walked throughout the ASS and could not locate a group of males
               matching the description Wilson gave me. I passed the
               information on to Swing shift along with a description of the
               involved males. Nothing further at this time. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               24th day of January, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               from the room. I responded and contacted three males in the
               room. They brought out and destroyed marijuana, drug
               paraphernalia and alcohol. I warned all three. Forward to WSU

               / MIP NARRATIVE: On 01/24/15 at about 2119 I was dispatched to
               a drugs call at Stephenson East room 1211. The RA could smell
               the odor of marijuana coming from the room. I responded and
               could smell the odor of marijuana coming from the door jam of
               room 1211. I knocked and Jonathan J. Spores (042396) answered
               the door. I asked if there was anyone else in the room. Ryan A.
               Lindsay (110495) and Cristian A. Gutierrez Acevedo (121595)
               were also in the room. Corporal Daniels asked who's room it
               was, and Spores and Lindsay said it was their room. I asked
               Spores if he knew why we were there. Spores said because of the
               marijuana. I asked he was 21, he said he was not. I asked if he
               had medical marijuana card, he said he did not. The other two
               in the room were not 21 and did not have medical marijuana
               cards either. I told Spores he could collect all the marijuana,
               other drugs and drug paraphernalia from the room and I would
               watch them destroy it. I told them I would then send my report
               to student conduct. Spores began to collect marijuana and drug
               paraphernalia from the room. Spores collected two small baggies
               with marijuana in them and a grinder. Corporal Daniels then
               asked if there was any alcohol in the room. Lindsay said no,
               but Spores immediately looked down and avoided eye contact. I
               said I noticed the hesitation, and asked if they were sure.
               They said there was alcohol in the room and brought out 3 full
               beer cans and four bottles of liquor. I escorted all three down
               to the dumpster and they destroyed the items. I again warned
               them that they were under 21 and not allowed to possess or
               consume alcohol or marijuana and they were also not allowed to
               have it in the dorms. I told them my report would be forwarded
               to student conduct. Forward to student conduct. I certify and

               Marijuana 2. NARRATIVE: On January 25, 2015 at approximately
               217 hours I was driving westbound on Grimes Way near the Lighty
               Building when I noticed a blue PT Cruiser in front of me
               traveling westbound on Grimes Way. The car had what appeared to
               be five occupants. I watched as the driver, leaned towards the
               driver's side window and large cloud of smoke came out of the
               window. When I drove through the smoke that was lingering in
               the air, I instantly recognized the odor to be burnt marijuana.
               The car came to a stop at Grimes Way and Stadium Way for a red
               light. The car turned right onto Stadium Way and I followed it.
               I could see into the driver's side mirror. The male who was
               driving the car appeared to be under the age of 21. Based on
               the odor and seeing the marijuana smoke coming from the side
               window, I stopped the vehicle for a terry stop for DUI. As soon
               as I reached the driver's side window I instructed the front
               passengers to put their hands on the dash and the rear
               passengers to put their hands on the headrests in front of
               them. I contacted the driver, Maximiliano Prado Cortes
               09/14/95, identified myself, informed the driver I was
               recording, and explained the reason for the stop. I asked for
               Cortes driver's license. Cortes provided his WADL which
               confirmed he was less than 21 years old. I asked Cortes if he
               had a medical marijuana card and he said no. I asked Cortes how
               much marijuana was left in the car. Cortes said he did not
               know. I asked where the marijuana went and the passenger said
               it went out the window. I told them that was not true since I
               was driving behind them and did not see anything come out of
               the window. It was clear that the occupants of the car were not
               going to be cooperative. I asked if anybody inside the car had
               a medical marijuana card and nobody spoke up that they did. I
               asked Cortes if I could talk to him outside the car and exited.
               Once on the sidewalk I asked Cortes if he had any weapons on
               him. As soon as I asked this Cortes put his hands into his
               pockets. I told Cortes to take his hands out and I frisked him
               for weapons. I felt no weapons during the frisk. I asked Cortes
               if he was new to smoking and Cortes said kind of. Cortes
               admitted to taking one hit off the marijuana joint. I asked
               Cortes if he was willing to do some voluntary field sobriety

               tests. Cortes said he would. I told Cortes I would be
               evaluating him on how well he followed my instructions as well
               as how well he performed the test. Cortes stated he understood.
               The tests were conducted on a level and paved sidewalk on
               Ferdinand's Lane. Cortes was wearing a dress shirt, neck tie,
               slacks, dress shoes, and a dress coat at the time of the tests.
               The sidewalk was lit by street lights, patrol car spot light,
               and personal flashlight. I explained to Cortes that I would be
               evaluating him on how well he followed my instructions as well
               as how well he performed the tests. The first test I
               administered was the HGN test. I instructed Cortes to stand
               with his heels and toes together and keep his arms at his
               sides. I told Cortes to remain in that position while I
               administered the test. Cortes stated he understood. I told
               Cortes to follow the tip of my pen with his eyes only and not
               to move his head. I held my pen approximately 12-15 inches away
               from Cortes's head. During the test I observed I observed no
               signs of HGN. Cortes eyes had a red coloration to them. The
               next test I administered was the walk and turn. I told Cortes
               to place his left foot on an imaginary line before him. I then
               instructed Cortes to place his right foot heel to toe in front
               of his left foot and keep his arms at his side. Cortes got into
               the starting position as instructed. I told Cortes to remain in
               that position as I gave further instructions. I told Cortes,
               when I tell you to begin, don't begin until I tell you, you
               will take a series of nine heel to toe steps down the line,
               with your arms at your side, looking down at your feet, and
               counting your steps out loud. Once you reach your ninth step
               leave your lead foot planted and with your rear foot take a
               series of small steps until you are facing where you came from
               and again take nine return heel to toe steps. I demonstrated
               the test for Cortes. I reminded Cortes to keep his arms at his
               side, count his steps out loud, look down at his feet, and do
               not stop the test until he had completed it. I asked Cortes if
               he would like me to demonstrate the test again and he said yes.
               I demonstrated the test a total of 3 times before Cortes stated
               he understood. Instruction Phase: Cortes started the test
               before me instructing him to do so. First Nine Steps: Raised
               his arms for balance twice. For the first 5 steps Cortes was
               looking ahead of him down the sidewalk instead of looking down
               at his feet. When Cortes reached his 9th Step he stopped and
               thought about what to do. When Cortes began is turn he used
               both feet to turn around. Once turned around Cortes again
               stopped and thought about what to do before continuing with the
               test. Return Nine Steps: no errors observed. The next test I
               administered was the One Leg Stand. I instructed Cortes to
               stand with his heels and toes together and keep his arms at his
               side. I told Cortes to remain in that position while I gave him
               further instructions. I told Cortes, when I tell you to begin,
               don't begin until I tell you, you will raise either leg of your
               choice and raise it six inches off the ground. You must point
               your toe so the sole of your shoe is parallel with the ground.
               While pointing your toe, keep your arms at your side, leg
               straight, look down at your foot and count out loud, one
               thousand one, one thousand two, one thousand three, and so on

               until I tell you to stop. If at any point you put your foot
               down, go ahead and pick it right back up and continue counting
               where ever you left off. I demonstrated the test and asked
               Cortes if he understood and he asked me to demonstrate the test
               again. Once I demonstrated the test again Cortes said he
               understood and began the test. Cortes raised his left foot and
               began the test. Cortes was not looking down at his foot as
               instructed. Instead Cortes was looking to the horizon. After
               Cortes reached 1007 I reminded him to look at his foot. During
               the test Cortes' body was shaking. Cortes counted to 17 in the
               30 seconds. The next test was the Romberg test. I told Cortes
               that I wanted him to stand with his heels and toes together and
               his arms at his side. I told Cortes when I told him to begin I
               wanted him to close his eyes, tilt his head back, and estimate
               the passage of 30 seconds. When he reached 30 seconds I told
               Cortes to tilt his head back forward and say stop. During the
               test I observed eyelid tremors and jugular vein visibly
               pounding. Cortes completed the test in 30 seconds. The last
               test was the lack of convergence test. I told Cortes to look at
               my pen as I moved it in a circle and brought it close to his
               nose. During the test Cortes eyes converged normally. I told
               Cortes that he was under arrest for minor operating a moving
               vehicle after consuming marijuana and handcuffed (D/L) him. I
               advised Cortes of his right to counsel and walked Cortes over
               to my patrol car where he was searched incident to arrest.
               Nothing of evidentiary value was found. I told Cortes he was
               being audio and video recorded and read him his Miranda rights
               of my department issued card. Cortes stated he understood his
               rights. I placed Cortes in the back seat of my patrol car. I
               spoke with each of the remaining passengers individually. The
               passengers were identified as, Jesus Benjamin Hernandez
               11/14/95, Jose Aquiles Gomez 04/16/97, Yerania Zulema Torres
               06/03/96, and Paul Timothy Garza. Each person was frisked for
               weapons and none were found. When I frisked Garza I found a
               large mass of items in his left pocket. I asked Garza what it
               was and he said it was his keys. I asked Garza if I could
               remove it from his pocket and Garza stated I could. I removed
               keys which had a large pichu pokemon figurine on it. There also
               was a green plastic pill bottle that was empty. Based on my
               training and experience, I recognized the pill bottle to be the
               kind you get from marijuana dispensaries. Each passenger stated
               they did not have a medical marijuana card. Only Garza admitted
               to smoking in the car. Hernandez stated the car was his
               mother's and informed me that he did not consent to any kind of
               search. I could not see any loose marijuana or paraphernalia. I
               believed that there was only a small amount of marijuana in the
               car and so I decided it was not worth to apply for a search
               warrant. I transported Cortes to the Pullman Holding Facility.
               I read Cortes the Implied Consent Warning for Breath but Cortes
               said he wanted to talk to an attorney. Cortes spoke with John
               Hart for approximately 15 minutes. Once Cortes was done I read
               Cortes his Constitutional Rights. Cortes stated he understood
               his rights and signed he understood his rights. I read Cortes
               "I understand my constitutional rights. I have decided not to
               exercise these rights at this time. Any statements made by me

               are made freely, voluntarily, and without threats or promises
               of any kind." Cortes did not know if he should sign that
               statement or not because he did want to keep his rights. Cortes
               thought about his decision for a while until I told him I would
               just write "refused" in his block, which I did. I read Cortes
               the Implied Consent Warning for Breath and Cortes signed that
               it had been read to him at 2230 hours. I told Cortes I would
               now be applying for a search warrant for his blood. I applied
               for a blood search warrant and was granted on by Judge
               Robinson. At 2357 hours I arrived back at the holding facility
               with the blood warrant. Pullman Fire Medics responded for the
               blood draw. I read Cortes a copy of the special evidence
               warning. I then read Cortes and the medics a copy of the
               warrant. I watched as Medic Patrick Fitzgerald swabbed the
               crook of Cortes' left arm with 1% iodine. I watched as
               Fitzgerald drew blood into the two grey top vials. Cortes'
               blood was taken at 0012 hours which was 2 hours and 54 minutes
               after Cortes stopped driving. I provided the medics and Cortes
               with copies of the following paperwork: search warrant, return
               of search warrant, and receipt of property taken forms. I told
               Cortes that his blood would be sent to the state toxicology lab
               for analysis. Cortes was finger printed and photographed. At
               approximately 0038 hours Cortes was released from custody.
               Pending the toxicology results, charges of minor operating a
               moving vehicle after consuming marijuana will be forwarded to
               the prosecutor. My VieVu camera footage was uploaded to the
               department's computer. END OF NARRATIVE I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               26th day of January, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               asked if he had a medical marijuana card, he said he did not. I
               told Schusser and Koloski I could smell an odor of marijuana
               coming from the room. I said they could collect all the
               marijuana, drug paraphernalia and any other drugs from the room
               and I would escort them to the dumpster to destroy the items. I
               said I would forward my report to student conduct. I warned
               them both that they could not possess or consume marijuana.
               Schusser collected two mason jars with about 6 grams of
               marijuana in them, 3 marijuana joints, 3 glass pipes, and a
               marijuana grinder. I escorted him to the dumpster and observed
               him destroy all the items and throw them in the dumpster. I
               again warned Schusser that he could not possess or consume
               marijuana. I told him I would forward my report to student
               conduct and asked if he had any questions. He said he did not.
               Forward to student conduct. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 24th day of January,
               2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               NARRATIVE: On 01-24-15 at about 2350 hours I was dispatched to
               the report of drugs at Perham hall room 611. The RP, Michael
               Hoodless, is the on-call hall director and called stating that
               he was at room 611 with four cooperative males who had a bong.
               I responded to Perham Hall and met with Hoodless, 3 other
               unidentified RA's and the four occupants of room 611. They were
               identified as Deven J. Chorlton, Timothy B. Black, Tanner G.
               Hegland and Harrison K. Clarke. I asked whose room I was at and
               Black said it was his room. I asked if he had a roommate and he
               said no. I looked into the room and could see a bong sitting on
               a table. I asked what was going on tonight and they stated that
               they had been hanging out drinking alcohol and smoking
               marijuana in the room. Chorlton said he hadn't been doing
               anything but hanging out. I asked if any of them were medical
               marijuana patients and they all said no. I explained to all
               four that if they wanted to gather all illegally possessed
               items from within the room I would just ask they they destroy
               what they had and the information would be sent to student
               conduct. They told me that Hoodless had already asked them to
               gather what they had and it was already together and ready to
               be destroyed. I went outside with all four while they disposed
               of empty beer cans and a bong. All four were cooperative and
               polite during my contact with them. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 25th day of

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0362 SYNOPSIS: I contacted three males
               and one female sitting in a vehicle parked behind Wegner Hall.
               One male exited the vehicle and was detained. There was a
               marijuana joint next to the seat where the one male exited. I
               arrested that male for possession of marijuana. During the
               search incident to arrest I found a small jar of marijuana on

               foot patrol near Goldsworthy Hall I saw four individuals
               sitting in a vehicle parked behind Wegner. As I approached the
               vehicle I could see the occupants passing something around and
               smoking it. I made contact with the driver and as I did the
               male in the passenger side rear of the vehicle opened the door
               and exited the vehicle. Corporal Daniels told the male later
               identified as, Arceo Martinez, Daniel (032496), to get back in
               the vehicle. Martinez did not comply and began to walk away
               from the vehicle. Corporal Daniels detained Martinez and
               handcuffed him. I had the other three occupants keep there
               hands where I could see them. I asked the driver what they were
               doing in the vehicle. The driver, Sinue M. Lozano Montez
               (111495), said they were just sitting in the vehicle smoking a
               swisher sweet. I identified the other two occupants. Sandra E.
               Ellenwood (123197) was in the front passenger seat and Moises
               Mercado (043097) was in the back seat on the driver's side.

               Exhibiting 2. NARRATIVE: On 01/25/15 at approximately 0045
               hours I was driving eastbound on Cougar Way near the Smith Gym
               when I noticed a female walking westbound on Cougar Way. The
               female grabbed my attention because as she walked she was
               stumbling side to side and her arms were swinging in an
               exaggerated motion. As I neared the female I noticed she
               appeared to be under the age of 21. I also noticed the female
               was not wearing any shoes and was not carrying any either. I
               passed the female and turned around at the next intersection. I
               pulled along side the female and exited my patrol car. I told
               the female, later identified as Sheri Ahn Yoo 07/17/96, that I
               needed to speak with her. Yoo stopped. I asked Yoo where her
               shoes were. Yoo responded, "I'm just going to Regents." I told
               Yoo what I had observed and asked if she had her ID. Yoo
               provided her WSU cougar card. I asked Yoo for her date of birth
               and she provided it verbally. Yoo identified herself as 18
               years old. I asked Yoo how much she had to drink tonight and
               Yoo said, "not that much." I asked how much that was for her
               and Yoo said, "literally just one shot." I asked Yoo if I could
               check her eyes and Yoo said that was fine. I told Yoo to put
               her heals and toes together and Yoo said, "can you hold my
               drink." Yoo handed me her cell phone to hold. I assumed Yoo had
               mistakenly said drink instead of cell phone because of her
               intoxication level. I explained the rest of the HGN test to
               Yoo. During the test I observed equal pupil size, equal
               tracking, lack of smooth pursuit, and distinct and sustained
               nystagmus at maximum deviation. During the test Yoo was
               guessing where the pen was going to move to instead of just
               following it. Yoo was swaying back and forth during the test. I
               could clearly smell the strong odor of intoxicants coming from
               Yoo's breath as she stood before me. I told Yoo, based on what
               I had observed I believed she had more to drink than just one
               shot. I asked Yoo if she was willing to be more honest with me.
               Yoo stated she had 3 or 4 shots. I asked Yoo if she was willing
               to provide a PBT sample. Yoo said, "I'm just going to be honest
               with you, I was going to have 3 or 4 shots with you, so I'm
               just going to be honest with you, 3 or 4 shots." I again asked
               Yoo if she was willing to provide a PBT sample and Yoo said she
               would. I realized I was out of breath tubes for my PBT so I was
               unable to have Yoo provide a sample. I told Yoo that I was

               hours I was dispatched to a drugs call at Perham Hall room 609.
               I called the Reporting Party, Michael Hoodless, who is the Hall
               Director on Duty. Hoodless stated that he was called to a drugs
               call by RA's. Upon arrival Hoodless smelled the door of room
               609 and surrounding doors. Hoodless stated the only room that
               smelled of marijuana was room 609. On a scale of 1 to 10, 10
               being 100% sure, Hoodless stated he was a 10 that the odor he
               smelled was marijuana. Hoodless also stated that he was a 10
               that the odor he smelled was coming from room 609. Hoodless
               stated that he knows the odor of marijuana from 7 controlled
               marijuana burns he has attended. The most recent controlled
               burn was August of 2014. Since November of 2014 Hoodless has
               called in 6 drug calls. Of the 6 calls 5 have resulted in
               marijuana being present. Hoodless stated that Deven James
               Chorlton 03/19/96 and Tanner Glenn Hegland 04/01/96 both live
               in room 609. Both are under the age of 21. Chorlton and Hegland
               have been contacted for marijuana three times other than this
               case. They were contacted on 11/04/14, 01/18/15, and 01/24/15.
               Both were contacted today around 0000 hours. They were warned
               for marijuana in room 611. When contacted 2 hours ago they both
               admitted to not having medical marijuana cards. I applied for
               and was granted a search warrant for room 609 by Judge
               Robinson. At 0302 hours Cpl. Daniels, Cpl. Edwards, and I all
               arrived at room 609 for the warrant service. I knocked and
               announced on the door saying, "Police Department, Search
               Warrant, open you door." I could hear items being quickly moved
               around the room. I knocked an announced again and I heard a
               male voice say something to the effect of, "they said search
               warrant." I could still hear items being moved around so I
               keyed into the room to prevent the destruction of evidence.
               When I opened the door I saw a male, later identified as Tanner
               Glenn Hegland 04/01/96 bent over trying to hide something. I
               told Hegland to put his hands up and grabbed him by the front
               of his shirt. I moved Hegland out of the way so Cpl. Edwards
               could grab the second male, Deven James Chorlton 03/19/96. I
               walked Hegland outside and I handcuffed Hegland as Cpl. Daniels

               handcuffed Chorlton. Both were frisked for weapons and none
               were found. I had both Hegland and Chorlton sit on the ground.
               I told them they were being detained an not under arrest. I
               read both their Miranda Rights of my department issued card.
               Both stated they understood their rights. I asked both, "having
               you rights in mind do you wish to speak with me?" Hegland said
               he would talk with me but Chorlton said he did not want to. I
               read both a copy of the warrant and put copies on each one of
               their desks. During the search the following items were seized:
               -1 pill bottle with marijuana inside -2 glass tubes with
               marijuana residue -1 glass pipe with burnt marijuana in the
               bowl -1 wood vaporizer with marijuana residue -1 metal grinder
               with marijuana inside of it -1 silver vaporizer with marijuana
               residue -1 metal tin with marijuana inside -1 envelope
               addressed to Deven Chorlton as indicia -9 unopened cans of
               Busch Light beer -1 can of half drank Keystone Light beer. A
               copy of the evidence log was left on each person's desk. I told
               Chorlton and Hegland that they were under arrest for possession
               of marijuana less than 40 grams and possession of alcohol by a
               minor. I walked the two to the bathroom and I unhandcuffed
               Chorlton so he could pour out the beer. Chorlton poured out the
               beers into the bathroom sink as I watched. Once the beers were
               poured out, Chorlton was rehandcuffed and I transported both
               males to Pullman Holding Facility where they were fingerprinted
               and photographed. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this ____ day of
               _____________, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.
