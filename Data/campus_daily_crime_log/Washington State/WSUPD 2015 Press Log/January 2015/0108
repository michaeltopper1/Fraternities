               January 8, 2015 at about 0735 hours I was dispatched to Knott
               Dairy Center on Country Club Road for a dog that was found

               was found last night running around the farm. The dog was
               playing with the dairy cows. Swain turned the dog over to me.
               The dog is a juvenile female German Shepard. The dog had no
               collar, tags or identification that could be seen. The dog was
               very friendly. I transported the dog to the Whitman County

               to the shelter staff. No further investigation. I certify and

               on 120314. No suspects or leads. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 010815 at approximately 1829
               hours, I was contacted at WSUPD by a male subject who
               identified himself as Balazs Szentkiralyi (042874). I asked him
               for identifcation and he told me he didn't have any. Balazs
               told me that he is hard of hearing and that he frequently used
               his TTY Text Telephone for the Deaf in Todd Hall near the entry
               way. Balazs stated that on 120314 at approximately 1800 hours,
               he was on his TTY phone in the entry hallway of Todd Hall
               Addition and was placed on hold. He stated he left to go to the
               bathroom for approximately 15 minutes and when he returned his
               TTY phone was gone. He told me it was a Ultratec Uniphone 1140
               valued at $75. He described the device as an older model having
               a keyboard with a black receiver and a tan base. Balazs told me
               he didn't know who may have taken the phone. I asked dispatch
               to run Balazs and was advised that Balazs was an alias for
               Ezsaias K. Szentkiralyi. When asked about the name discrepancy,
               he stated his given name was Balazs, and he changed his name to
               Ezsaias. I provided him with his case number and cleared. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of

               to a possible trespass at Stephenson North. Hall staff escorted
               the female out of the Stephenson North. I responded to the area
               and was unable to locate the female. Nothing further at this

               01/08/15 at about 2042 hours dispatch advised there was a
               female trespassing in Stephenson North. Dispatch said hall
               staff had escorted the female out of the hall and she was
               walking up Stadium Way. I responded to the area and looked for
               the female, described as being in her 20's or 30's, 5'06",
               wearing glasses, a blue puffy coat and a grey or blue beanie.
               She also had a cat with her in a blanket. I searched the area
               but was unable to locate the female. I called the reporting
               party Rebecca N. Shelley (031694). She said residents of
               Stephenson North had notified her there was a female in the
               fourth floor lounge they did not recognize. Shelley and her
               partner went to the lounge and asked the female if she lived in
               Stephenson North. The female said she did not, but her friend
               lives on the tenth floor. Shelley escorted the female to the
               tenth floor but she was unable to show where her friend lived.
               They then escorted the female out of the hall, and called
               dispatch. Shelley also told me that the female had a pet
               carrier with her. The female also left behind a popcorn tin in
               the fourth floor lounge. The description of the female matches,
               Allyson A. Wolf (062978), who was contacted on a similar case
               (14-W5440). I also conducted a walk through of Cleveland Hall
               and the Education Addition, which are two buildings where Wolf
               has been seen lately. I was still not able to locate her.
