               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0085 01/10/15 SYNOPSIS: Male locked in
               men's restroom in Hydrotherapy Building. He was contacted and
               warned. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. ELLIOTT, Jacob

               10, 2015 at about 0916 hours I was dispatched to a suspicious
               male who was locked in a men's restroom behind Bohler. I
               responded to the area where I was contacted by Jaimie Hoskins,
               WSU Athletics near Bohler. Officer Kirshner also responded to
               the area with me. Hoskins told me one of her Athletic Training
               Interns was in the Hydrotherapy Building located between
               Mooberry Track and Hollingbery Fieldhouse. The Intern was
               working with an athlete when a suspicious male walked in the
               unlocked door to the small Hydrotherapy Building. Once inside
               the male entered the single room men's restroom and locked the
               door. The Intern and athlete left the building and called
               Hoskins. Hoskins and I walked to the Hydrotherapy Building. I
               found the main entry door locked. Hoskins unlocked the door for
               me and I entered the building. I found the men's restroom door
               closed and locked. I knocked on the door several times
               eventually making contact with a male inside. Jacob D. Elliott
               (04/28/92) came out of the restroom. I identified him by his
               passport. Elliott claims he was out partying last night and did
               not make it to his Skyview Drive apartment. The weather at the
               time of the contact was about 31 degrees Fahrenheit. I could
               not smell any alcohol as there were two therapy pools with the
               strong odor of pool chlorine. I warned Elliott about being in
               the building and escorted him out. He was polite and
               cooperative. Hoskins looked around the building and determined
               nothing was missing or damaged. She locked the door once
               everyone was out of the building. As Officer Kirshner and I
               were leaving the area I saw Elliott walking down the tunnel
               area of the Football Operations Building. He said he was lost.
               We gave him directions to the CUB and cleared the scene. No
               further investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 10th day of January,
               2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               Driving under 21 after consuming marijuana 2. NARRATIVE: On
               01/10/15 at about 2035 hours I observed a vehicle traveling
               west on North Fairway Dr. I activated my radar and it displayed
               a reading of 29 MPH. The posted speed limit on North Fairway Dr
               is 20 MPH. I turned activated my overhead lights and stopped
               the vehicle. I contacted the driver Zachery S. Burchett
               (042695), when I approached the vehicle Burchett did not have
               his window rolled down. When I got up to his window he rolled
               it down only about 3 to 4 inches. I could smell a strong odor
               of marijuana coming from the vehicle. I informed Burchett the
               stop was being recorded and asked for his driver license,
               registration and proof of insurance. He handed me the
               registration and his license but I had to ask again for the
               proof of insurance, and he gave it to me. I asked if he knew
               why I was stopping him. He said he did not know. I told him
               that he was speeding. I then told him I could smell a strong
               odor of marijuana coming from the vehicle and I asked him if he
               had been smoking marijuana, he said he had not. I went back and
               had dispatch run Burchett, he was clear of warrant and the
               Department of License computer was down, so there was no
               return. I contacted Burchett again and asked if he would do
               some voluntary field sobriety test. He said he would and exited
               the vehicle. Once outside of the vehicle I could still smell a
               strong odor of marijuana coming from Bruchett. I began the
               standardized field sobriety tests by asking him to stand with
               his feet together, hands at his side, and to stay in that
               position during the first test. The first test is the
               Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. I explained to Burchett that it
               was an eye test. He was not wearing glasses and I asked if he
               was wearing contacted. He said he was not. I explained that
               during the test he needed to follow the tip of my pen with his
               eyes only, and not to move his head. Burchett said he
               understood. I observed both of Burchett's eyes were equal size
               and there was no resting nystagmus. His eyes tracked equally. I
               did not observe lack of smooth pursuit, nystagmus at maximum
               deviation, or onset of nystagmus prior to 45 degrees. The next
               test I explained to Burchett was the walk and turn. I explained
               to Burchett to imagine a line straight out in front of him and
               to place his left foot on that line an then place he right foot

               in front of his left with his heel and toe touching. I also
               told him to keep his hands at his sides and to maintain that
               position while I explained the test and not to begin the test
               until I told him to. I explained to Burchett that he was to
               take nine heel to toe steps along the imaginary line. Then when
               he reached his ninth step to keep that foot on the line and
               make a series of small steps to turn around and take nine to
               heel to toe steps back along the same line. I demonstrated
               three steps and I also demonstrated the turn and then three
               return steps, explaining that he need to take the full nine
               steps down and back. I told him that during the test he needed
               to keep his hands at his side, look at his feet while he was
               walking and count his steps out loud. I also told him that once
               he began the test he needed to continue until the test was
               complete. I asked Burchett if he understood, he said he did. I
               told him to begin the test. On his first step from the starting
               position he stepped on his toe and offline by 2 to 3 inches. He
               stepped offline 2 to 3 inches on his second step as well. On
               the return nine steps he did not touch heel to toe on his first
               or third step, and he stepped offline on his ninth step 2 to 3
               inches. The next test I explained was the one leg stand. I
               instructed Burchett to stand with his feet together, hands at
               his side, and to maintain that position while I explained the
               instructions. I also told him not to begin the test until I
               told him to. I asked if he understood he said he did. I
               explained that during this test he was to lift the leg of his
               choice so that his foot was six inches off the ground and
               parallel to the ground. Then he was to count out loud by one
               thousands until I told him to stop. I demonstrated the stance
               and the counting "one thousand one, one thousand two, one
               thousand three". I explained that during the test he needed to
               keep his hands at his side, he needed to look at his foot and
               to count out loud as demonstrated. I asked if he understood, he
               said he did. I asked him which foot he was going to raise, he
               said he was going to raise his right foot. Burchett raised his
               right foot and counted by one thousands. He counted to 20 by
               one thousands in 30 seconds. He leaned to the left and held his
               pant legs during the test. He also only raised his foot about 2
               inches off the ground. The next test I explained was the
               modified Romberg test. I explained that he needed to stand with
               his feet together and his hands at his side and to maintain
               that position while I explained the test. I asked if he
               understood and he said he did. I explained that during this
               test he was to tilt his head back, close his eyes and estimate
               the passage of thirty seconds. I asked if he understood he said
               that he did. I told him to begin. During this test I observed
               eye lid tremors in both of his eyes as he had his head tilted
               back. I also observed leg tremors. Based on my training and
               experience these are indicators of marijuana use. Burchett
               stopped at 36 seconds. I asked him how he determined the
               passage of thirty seconds. He stated that he counted by one
               thousand like in the previous test. I then conduct another eye
               test that checks for lack of convergence. I did not observe any
               lack of convergence. I then administered a PBT test. Burchett
               provided a sample to my ALCO Sensor FST (SN#102461) and it

               recorded a reading of .000. I performed the PBT in accordance
               with state toxicologist recommendations and I have been trained
               in using the ALCO Sensor FST PBT. I asked Burchett if he had
               smoked marijuana and he said that he did not smoke marijuana. I
               told Burchett that he was under arrest for driving under 21
               after consuming marijuana. I placed him in handcuffs (DL), told
               him that he was being recorded, and I read him Miranda warnings
               from my department issued Miranda card. I asked Burchett if an
               officer could back his car about twenty feet so it was in a
               legal parking place. He said that was fine. Officer Westerman
               back the vehicle up into a legal parking place on North Fairway
               Dr. I searched Burchett incident to arrest and transported him
               to Pullman Police Dept. I went to WSU PD and prepared and
               applied for a search warrant for Burchett's blood. Judge
               Douglas B Robinson granted the warrant at 2322 hours on
               01/10/15. I returned to Pullman PD and asked dispatch to have
               Pullman Fire Dept. respond to Pullman PD for a blood draw.
               Pullman Paramedic Anthony Nuttman responded to draw the blood.
               I read the warrant to Burchett and Nuttman. Nuttman drew two
               vials of blood from Burchett at 2346 hours on 01/10/15. I had
               Burchett and Nuttman sign the receipt of property taken and the
               return of search warrant. I gave Burchett and Nuttman copies of
               the warrant, the receipt of items taken and the return of
               search warrant. Pullman Fire Dept cleared. I gave Burchett his
               DUI hearing form and Corporal Daniels explained it to him. I
               fingerprinted and photographed Burchett and released him from
               the Pullman PD holding facility. Charges pending results from
               state toxicology lab. Officer Curtis Whitman WSU Police Dept

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0098 SYNOPSIS: 3 males contacted for
               drugs at Gannon Hall 603. All referred to student conduct.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Parker W Benoit

               12/11/95 Student Conduct Poss. of Marijuana NARRATIVE: On
               January 11, 2015 at approximately 2130 hours I was dispatched
               to a drugs call at Gannon Hall room 603. I called the Reporting
               Party, Ross A. McClure, who is the Hall Director on Duty.
               McClure stated that he was called to a drugs call at Gannon
               Hall room 603. Upon arrival McClure went to room 603 and
               smelled the door crack. McClure could smell the odor of
               marijuana coming from within the room. McClure smelled the
               surrounding doors and could only smell marijuana coming from
               room 603. On a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being 100% positive,
               McClure stated he 8 out of 10 that the odor was coming from
               room 603. McClure also stated he was a 10 out of 10 that the
               odor that he smelled was marijuana. McClure stated he knows the
               odor of marijuana from approximately 9 controlled burns that he
               had attended. McClure's most recent controlled burn was August
               of 2014. As of October 2014 McClure has called in 7 drug calls.
               Of the 7 calls, 6 resulted in marijuana being present at the
               room. On November 10, 2014 at approximately 1255 hours, Ofc.
               Kirshner responded to Gannon Hall room 603 for a drugs call. At
               the call the sole occupant of room 603, Dmarco J. Degross
               11/09/95, turned over two joints of marijuana. Degross told
               Ofc. Kirshner that he did not possess a medical marijuana card.
               Degross is 19 years old. McClure confirmed that Degross is
               still the only occupant of room 603. I applied for a search
               warrant with the above information and was granted a search
               warrant by Judge Robinson. At 2228 hours Ofc. Edwards and I
               responded to room 603 to serve the warrant. When I reached room
               603 I could smell the odor of marijuana coming from the room.
               Before I knocked and announced I noticed the door decorations
               had the name "Parker" and no mention of a Dmarco Degross. I
               turned to the RED and asked again who lived in the room.
               McClure said he would check again. About this time Robel Embza
               Hailu 08/03/95 walked out of the room. When Hailu walked out
               the odor of burnt marijuana intensified. I asked for Hailu's ID
               which he provided. I asked if Degross still lived in room 603
               and Hailu said he did not know who that was. At that point I
               decided that I was provided with incorrect information by the
               RED. I knocked on the door and Parker William Benoit 06/18/96

               answered. I asked Benoit and whoever else was in the room to
               come out into the hallway. One other person exited, Paul Thomas
               Hinton 12/11/95. I told the three that I had a search warrant
               for the room but because I was provided the wrong information
               about who lived in the room I was not going to execute it as it
               stood. I told Benoit that he had two options. Option one was to
               turn over all his marijuana and smoking devices. If he did that
               he would be referred only to student conduct. The second option
               was to refuse the first and I would call the Judge and amend my
               warrant to reflect the new information. If the Judge signed off
               on it I would search the room and any illegal items would be
               charged to him. Benoit said he wanted to take the first option.
               Benoit went into his room and grabbed a small about of loose
               marijuana from his desk. Benoit said they had been smoking off
               campus and did not smoke in the dorm room. It was clear that
               all three had been smoking together. All three smelled
               individually of burnt marijuana and each had bloodshot eyes. I
               told all three that they would be referred to student conduct
               for their involvement. Benoit and I walked to the dumpster
               where he destroyed his marijuana. After the marijuana was
               destroyed I told Benoit that he was free to go. I spoke with
               McClure to find out why I was provided with the wrong name of
               the occupant. McClure stated that the RA on the floor had
               provided him with the hall roster but he did not notice it was
               the last semester roster and not the current one. McClure
               apologized for not double checking. A return of search was
               completed as sent to the court. END OF REPORT I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               11th day of January, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0101 SYNOPSIS: Lewis was pulled over for
               speeding. While being questioned, Lewis had a seizure in the
               driver's seat. Lewis refused medical treatment by the medics.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Nathan C. Lewis
               04/22/95 2. NARRATIVE: On 01/11/15 at approximately 0002 hours
               I was on a traffic stop with Nathan C. Lewis 04/22/95, as the
               driver. I recognized Lewis from a prior drug arrest and was
               asking him about the faint odor of marijuana I was smelling
               coming from the car. While asking Lewis about the drugs, Lewis'
               eyes rolled towards the back of his head, his head tilted up to
               the ceiling, his body went ridged, and Lewis began to seize
               shaking uncontrollably. I immediately called for an ambulance.
               Lewis seized for approximately 5 seconds before coming out of
               it. While Lewis was seizing, I had the passenger make sure the
               car was in park and remove the keys from the ignition. As soon
               as Lewis stopped seizing I asked him if he was ok several times
               before Lewis answered me. Lewis said he was fine and acted as
               if nothing had happened. Lewis had no memory of having a
               seizure. I told Lewis that I was not going to arrest him for
               any drug related crimes but I needed to know what he had taken
               recently that would cause him to have a seizure. Lewis said he
               is on probation and so he has not been doing drugs. Lewis
               stated that he has never had a seizure before and no other
               medical history. After the seizure Lewis was sweating profusely
               to the point that his entire face was covered in beaded sweat.
               I waited with Lewis until the medics arrived to evaluate him.
               Lewis refused any medical treatment from the medics and would
               not even let them take his vital signs. Lewis signed a patient
               refusal form for the medics and they cleared. I urged Lewis to
               allow is passenger to drive the rest of the way and he agreed.

               approximately 0031 hours I responded to the report of an
               unconscious female found in the 5th floor bathroom of Streit
               Hall. Upon arrival the RA stated they had found the female in
               bathroom stall. I knocked on the closed bathroom stall and
               identified myself. I asked the female, later identified as
               Jacqueline I. Reeve 04/20/96, if she could open the door. Reeve
               opened the door and I noticed she was standing in a large pile
               of vomit. Reeve appeared to be very intoxicated and was swaying
               side to side as she stood in the vomit. I asked Reeve a series
               of questions to determine her mental status. Reeve answered
               most questions correctly however Reeve believed she was
               currently at a sorority. Reeve also thought the month was
               October. I had Reeve come out into the main area of the
               bathroom. I continued to ask Reeve questions but instead of
               answering them she decided to glare at me. I told Reeve that it
               would be in her best interest to answer the questions that the
               medics will ask because if she does not she will be taken to
               the hospital. Once medics arrived they spoke with her for
               approximately 30 minutes before deciding that they could not
               force Reeve to go to the hospital. Medics finally allowed Reeve
               to go to her room unaccompanied. During the whole contact Reeve
               was uncooperative with Law Enforcement and Paramedics. END OF

               BAC .190 and .177 NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               Ashlee L.K. Hanson 05/10/95 Arrested DUI 5Z0156161 2.
               NARRATIVE: On January 11th, 2015 at approximately 0120 hours I
               was driving southbound on North Fairway near Bailey Brayton
               Field when I noticed a Volkswagen sedan traveling southbound on
               North Fairway towards me. The vehicle appeared to be traveling
               faster than the posted 20 MPH zone. I activated my in car radar
               and obtained a reading of 33 MPH. As soon as the car passed my
               location I turned around to catch back up with it. I initiated
               a traffic stop at North Fairway and the Outdoor Recreation
               Center. At the time of the stop the roadway was covered in a
               layer of snow and frozen rain. The roadway was slick. I
               contacted the driver, Ashlee Loreen Kelly Hanson 05/10/95,
               identified myself, informed the driver I was recording, and
               asked her if she knew why I had stopped her. Hanson stated she
               knew she was going 20 MPH. I saw Hanson had her wallet out and
               was already trying to get her driver's license out. I also
               asked for her proof of insurance and vehicle registration. As
               Hanson grabbed her information I could smell the very strong
               odor of intoxicants coming from the car. There was one other
               passenger other than Hanson. I asked Hanson how much she had to
               drink tonight. Hanson stated she had "nothing." Hanson then
               said she did have something to drink but it had been hours ago.
               I asked how long ago had she drank and Hanson said it was about
               four hours ago. Hanson said she had three shots. I asked Hanson
               if I could check her eyes and she stated yes. I preformed an
               HGN test on Hanson as she sat in the vehicle. I told Hanson to
               follow the tip of my finger with her eyes only and do not move
               her head. During the HGN test I observed equal pupil size,
               equal tracking, lack of smooth pursuit, and distinct and
               sustained nystagmus in both eyes. Hanson's eyes were bloodshot
               and watery. I asked Hanson if she could talk to me outside of
               the car. Once outside of the car and on the sidewalk I asked
               Hanson if she was willing to do some voluntary standardized
               field sobriety tests. Hanson stated she would. The tests were
               conducted on a paved sidewalk on North Fairway next to the ORC.
               The sidewalk had a slight grade in a north to south direction.
               Hanson was wearing a velvet track suit and Ugg slippers at the
               time of the tests. The sidewalk was lit by street lights,
               patrol car spot light, and personal flashlight. The sidewalk
               had a thin layer of fresh snow on it. I explained to Hanson
               that I would be evaluating her on how well she followed my

               instructions as well as how well she performed the tests. The
               first test I administered was the HGN test. I instructed Hanson
               to stand with her heels and toes together and keep her arms at
               her sides. I told Hanson to remain in that position while I
               administered the test. Hanson stated she understood. I told
               Hanson to follow the tip of my pen with her eyes only and not
               to move her head. I held my pen approximately 12-15 inches away
               from Hanson's head. During the test I observed, equal pupil
               size, equal tracking, lack of smooth pursuit, and distinct and
               sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes. I also
               observed vertical nystagmus. While conducting the test Hanson
               was swaying side to side. As Hanson stood before me I could
               clearly smell the odor of intoxicants coming from her breath.
               About this time Sgt. Griffin arrived on scene. The next test I
               administered was the walk and turn. I told Hanson to place her
               left foot on an imaginary line before her. I then instructed
               Hanson to place her right foot heel to toe in front of her left
               foot and keep her arms at her side. Hanson got into the
               starting position as instructed. I told Hanson to remain in
               that position as I gave further instructions. I told Hanson,
               when I tell you to begin, don't begin until I tell you, you
               will take a series of nine heel to toe steps down the line,
               with your arms at your side, looking down at your feet, and
               counting your steps out loud. Once you reach your ninth step
               leave your lead foot planted and with your rear foot take a
               series of small steps until you are facing where you came from
               and again take nine return heel to toe steps. I demonstrated
               the test for Hanson. I reminded Hanson to keep her arms at her
               side, count her steps out loud, look down at her feet, and do
               not stop the test until she had completed it. I asked Hanson if
               she understood and Hanson said she did. I told Hanson she could
               begin as soon as she was ready. Instruction Phase: I had to
               tell Hanson several times to put her feet in a straight line.
               Hanson kept staggering them. First Nine Steps: Hanson stepped
               off line on steps 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Hanson did not
               touch heel to toe on steps 2 and 5. Hanson used both feet to
               turn around and stumbled to her right as she turned. Return
               Nine Steps: Hanson stepped off line on steps 1, 2, 4, and 5.
               Hanson did not touch heel to toe on steps, 6, 7, 8, and 9. The
               next test I administered was the One Leg Stand. I instructed
               Hanson to stand with her heels and toes together and keep her
               arms at her side. I told Hanson to remain in that position
               while I gave her further instructions. I told Hanson, when I
               tell you to begin, don't begin until I tell you, you will raise
               either leg of your choice and raise it six inches off the
               ground. You must point your toe so the sole of your shoe is
               parallel with the ground. While pointing your toe, keep your
               arms at your side, leg straight, look down at your foot and
               count out loud, one thousand one, one thousand two, one
               thousand three, and so on until I tell you to stop. If at any
               point you put your foot down, go ahead and pick it right back
               up and continue counting where ever you left off. I
               demonstrated the test and asked Hanson if she understood and
               she stated yes. I told Hanson to begin whenever she was ready.
               Hanson raised her right foot and began the test. As soon as

               Hanson raised her right foot she immediately put it back down.
               Hanson put her foot down several times and I was unable record
               them all. Hanson put her foot down a minimum of four times.
               Each time Hanson put her foot down she would start counting
               over from one. Hanson counted to 9 in the 30 seconds. During
               the test Hanson was not looking down at her foot. During the
               test Hanson was also swaying and using her arms for balance. I
               told Hanson that the last test I had for her was the PBT. I
               explained what the PBT was, that it was voluntary, and it did
               not replace the evidentiary breath test. I found my PBT (Alco-
               Sensor FST #16805) in working condition. Hanson provided a PBT
               sample of .144. I told Hanson that she was under arrest for DUI
               and handcuffed (D/L) her. I advised Hanson of her right to
               counsel and walked Hanson over to my patrol car where she was
               searched incident to arrest. Nothing of evidentiary value was
               found. I placed Hanson in the back seat of my patrol car. I
               told Hanson that the vehicle was going to be towed and wanted
               to know if there was anything in the car she wanted out of it.
               Hanson stated she would like her cell phone and wallet. Sgt.
               Griffin stayed with the vehicle and I transported Hanson to
               Pullman Police Department for BAC. Upon arrival I checked the
               Datamaster and found it working properly, with the RFI antenna
               attached, the mouth tube warm to the touch, and a temperature
               within ranges. At 0149 hours I checked Hanson's mouth and had
               her remove gum. I again checked her mouth and found no foreign
               substances. I read Hanson her Constitutional Rights at 0150
               hours. Hanson stated she understood her rights and signed she
               understood her rights and decided not to exercise her rights. I
               read Hanson the Implied Consent Warning for Breath and Hanson
               signed that it had been read to her at 0153 hours. Hanson
               stated she was willing to provide a breath sample. Hanson
               provided a breath sample of .190 at 0210 hours and another
               sample of .177 at 0213 hours. The breath test was administered
               in accordance to the methods approved by the Washington State
               Toxicologist pursuant to the Washington Administrative Code. I
               provided Hanson a copy of the following documents: Driver's
               Hearing Request, Notice of Hearing/Conditions of Release, tow
               and impound form, and the breath test document. Hanson was
               issued Sector Citation 5Z0156161 for RCW 46.61.502 DUI. I
               explained the citation and provided her with her copy. Hanson
               was finger printed and photographed. At approximately 0257
               hours Hanson was released from custody. Hanson's vehicle was
               impounded by Myer's Towing for 12 hours. My VieVu camera
               footage was uploaded to the department's computer. END OF
