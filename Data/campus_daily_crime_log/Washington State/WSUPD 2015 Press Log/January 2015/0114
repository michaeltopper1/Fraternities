               sign violation at NE North Fairway Lane. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On January 14, 2015 I
               received a report of a school bus stop violation from Pullman
               School District #267. According to the report the violation
               occurred on Tuesday, January 13, 2015 at about 1150 hours at
               the bus stop on North Fairway Lane at Bailey-Brayton Field
               school bus stop. The OSPI School Bus Stop Violation report form
               has been added to the case file. Nour Alsouwd was operating bus
               #9, a fully marked Pullman School District #267 school bus. The
               bus was stopped in the roadway to discharge and receive school
               children using the red lights and stop paddle for traffic
               control. Alsouwd writes that the suspect vehicle "Crossed the
               stop signs while I was unloading kids. Stop sign was out. I
               honked the horn cople times but she didn't stop." Alsouwd
               described the vehicle as no color given, Subaru wagon with
               Washington license plate AGL370. Alsouwd describes the driver
               as being an Asian/Pacific Islander female with medium length
               dark hair. The vehicle license returned "no computer record
               found." I could not locate the vehicle in the Spillman
               database. I am unable to contact the registered owner or driver
               as I do not have a valid license plate. No infractions or
               citations issued. When the OSPI form arrives I will fill it out
               and returned to the Pullman School District and scan it into
               the case. No further investigation. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 14th day of
               January, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0162 SYNOPSIS: Pullman PD
               requested an agency assist on a suspicious call. I responded,
               checked the area and contacted the home owner. Home owner may
               have been mistaken as the suspicious person by the witness.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               01/14/15 at about 2059 Pullman Police were dispatched to a
               suspicious call at 1765 SW Casey Ct. Pullman. At 2130 hours
               Pullman PD requested a WSU PD unit to handle the call. I
               responded and checked the area. The suspicious person was
               described as a male wearing dark baggy clothing. I did not see
               anyone matching the description in the area. Corporal Daniels
               observed the garage door of the house next door was open. I
               talked to the complainant Julie A. Walker at 1765 SW Casey Ct.
               She said the neighbor saw someone near the house and then saw
               them go into the backyard. Walker said her husband looked
               around in the backyard and let the dog out into the backyard to
               see if it would bark at anyone out there. Walker said her
               husband also found the gate between their two garages open. She
               said her husband had been out front putting out the garbage
               about the same time the witness saw the man and thought at
               first maybe that was who the neighbor saw. Walker said the
               route the witness described did not match her husbands. Walker
               believed the witness described the man going into the backyard
               by passing between the two garages. I checked the backyard and
               did not see any foot prints in the frost covered grass. My foot
               steps sunk into the grass and were highly visible. I contacted
               the next door neighbor about the garage door being open. The
               door was closed now. The home owner had returned home and not
               closed the garage door. His son later closed the door. I told
               the home owner to notify me if anything was missing or out of
               place in his garage, and that I would be in the area for awhile
               following up. I went across the street to 1815 SW Clay Ct. and
               talked to the witness Kendra D. Goetz (030191). She said she
               saw a male in dark baggy clothes near the garage at 1765. She
               said she thought the male saw her and at that point hurried off
               around the side of the house to the backyard. Goetz described
               the male as about 6 feet tall, medium build probably between 30
               and 40 years old. She said that she saw him around 2040 hours.
               Goetz said when the man hurried off he did not go between the
               garages but around the house to the left. Looking back towards
               Walker's house from Goetz's house if someone went around the
               corner to the left they would be at the front door of the
               house. The front door of Walker's house is not visible from

               Greek Row. Subject was intoxicated and was later transported to
               PRH for evaluation by Medics. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 01-15-15 at approximately 0107
               hours, Ofc. Whitman and I responded to Regents Hall for a
               female who was reported to have been possibly roofied and was
               combative. When we arrived, the female had been taken to room
               382. We were escorted up by her boyfriend, Connor Webb. Connor
               stated he had been texted by Andrea to pick her up from Greek
               Row. The address she texted him was 1005 NE Indiana St. He said
               he picked her up and she told him she didn't feel right and
               this was not a normal drunk. He said he brought her back to
               Regents and when they went to get out of the car she was crying
               and began shaking. He wasn't sure if she was having a seizure
               or not so he called 911. He said she got mad because she didn't
               want to get into trouble. Connor said he flagged down some
               girls and asked them to go get her roommate and they did. They
               then helped Andrea to her room. Ofc. Whitman spoke to Andrea
               who was in the room with some other females. Andrea was crying
               and stating she didn't want us there as she was concerned about
               getting into trouble. She was not combative, but was not
               cooperative. When medics arrived, she continued to be
               uncooperative with them. I went into the room and explained to
               her we were there to help and she was not in any trouble. I
               explained everything to her and began asking her questions
               about her night. She was able to tell me she had been drinking
               mixed drinks of vodka and lemonade. She didn't know how many
               and the drinks were in solo cups. When I asked her if she had
               made the drinks herself she said some of them. I asked her if
               she had noticed any of them tasting funny and she said no. I
               asked her how often she drinks and she said not very often. I
               asked her if she had been assaulted in any way and she said no.
               I was able to get her to provide a very poor breath sample
               which was a .126, but stated it was only for assessment
               purposes. Based on my training and experience it appeared
               Andrea was just intoxicated to me. Andrea never stated to me
               she thought she had been drugged. Due to call volume, I asked
               medics if they needed us to stay and they stated we could
               clear. I was later advised Medics transported Andrea to PRH
               because she wasn't able to answer their questions. They stated
               it was a voluntary transport. They also advised she had told
               them she had been roofied and didn't feel it was a normal
