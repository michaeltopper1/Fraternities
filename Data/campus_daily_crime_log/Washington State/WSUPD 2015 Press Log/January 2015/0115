               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0171 SYNOPSIS: Responded to a malicious
               mischief of a vehicle. No suspects or leads NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 011515 at
               approximately 0728 hours, I was dispatched to a report of a
               malicious mischief report at Kruegel Hall. Upon arrival, I
               contacted Peter D. Dilella who told me the following. on 011415
               at approximately 1700 hours, he and other Thyssen Krupp
               Elevator company employees decided to leave the elevator
               company pickup in the parking lot over night because they had
               to return to work there in the morning. On 011515 at
               approximately 0720 hours, they returned to the parking lot and
               noticed that the elevator company pickup had been damaged. They
               had no idea who damaged the truck. I checked the damage and
               noticed that the front windshield had a large area that was
               smashed near the center of the window and there were several
               cracks throughout the window. There was two deep gouges in the
               hood of the truck and the driver's side window had a large
               gouge in the glass, but it was not broken. On the ground was a
               large jagged rock that had fresh scrapings. It appeared that
               the suspects threw the rock on the hood, windshield twice and
               once against the driver's window. I estimated the damage to the
               vehicle at approximately $3000.00. I took photographs of the
               damage and provided Dilella with the police report number. Case
               inactive pending further leads. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 15th day of
               January, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0176 SYNOPSIS: Responded to a non-injury
               collision in the Daggy Hall parking structure. A vehicle
               entered the structure with a Yakima box on the roof and damaged
               the duct work in the structure due to the vehicle being too
               tall for the garage. No suspects or leads NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 011515 at
               approximately 1152 hours, I was dispatched to a report of a
               vehicle collision in the Daggy Hall parking structure. Upon
               arrival, I contacted Perry J. Berger who told me the following.
               On 011515 at approximately 1145 hours, he was standing in the
               Daggy Hall parking garage when he saw a 2014 Subaru Forrester
               with a Yakima roof cargo box, driven by Karen J. Jennings,
               enter the parking structure. As the Subaru entered the
               structure the cargo box hit the 6'4" clearance bar at the
               entrance to the structure and caused it to swing. Jennings
               continued to drive her car into the structure. As she continued
               through the parking structure lot, the cargo box continued to
               rub against the duct work inside the structure that was sitting
               at 84 inches. Approximately half way through the structure, the
               duct work dips down to 77 inches from the ground for
               approximately 7 feet long before going back up to the 84 inch
               clearance level. Berger stated he watched Jennings drive her
               car into the lower part of the duct work which caused the cargo
               container to dent the duct work in approximately six to seven
               inches. The vehicle stopped, backed up and then moved over from
               the duct work to a space to drive where there were no
               obstructions. Berger stated she continued to the back of the
               structure where Jennings parked her car and left the structure.
               I checked the vehicle and cargo container and didn't see any
               physical damage to either. I checked the duct work and noticed
               plastic transfer marks where it rubbed on the 7 foot stretch of
               lower duct work and concaved it upward approximately seven
               inches. I noticed that several of the brackets in that section
               of duct work were bent and the screws were pulling out. I took
               photographs of the damage and contacted WSU Facilities Ryan L.
               Gary with the sheet metal shop to respond for an estimate of
               the damage. Gary arrived and checked the damage to the duct
               work. Gary stated that the cost to replace the section of duct
               work would cost roughly $2000.00 for material and labor. I
               thanked him for his time. I remained in the area taking
               photographs and while I was talking to Gary, Jennings walked up
               and told me that she was driving the car that hit the duct
               work. She stated she didn't realize that her husband left the

               Yakima cargo carrier on the roof of her car and she didn't
               realize she was hitting the duct work until she was about half
               way through the lot. I showed her where she damaged the duct
               work and she told me that she was responsible for the damage. I
               asked her why she didn't report the damage right away and she
               stated that she didn't realize she cause damage to anything in
               the structure and she was running late to teach a class. I
               explained to her that she needs to remain on scene of a
               collision and she told me she understood. I took pictures of
               her vehicle and recorded that her insurance is through State
               Farm #0084250C2612B and it expires in March 2015. I explained
               that I was going to forward my report to WSU Risk Management
               and they were going to deal with the insurance aspect of this
               case. Jennings told me she undersood and I told her she was
               free to leave. I assisted her in leaving the parking structure
               where she wouldn't cause more damage to her cargo container or
               the roofing of the parking structure. Forward to WSU Risk
               Management. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 15th day of January, 2015, in
               Pullman, Washington. _______________________________________

               harassing text messages from an unknown person. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On January 15, 2015 at
               about 1257 hours I was dispatched to a report of threatening
               text messages. I contacted the complainant/victim, Kylie M.
               Kilmer (09/22/95) by telephone. Kilmer said she received
               several text messages yesterday, Wednesday, January 14, 2015
               between 1800 and 1930 hours. Kilmer thought the messages were
               being sent by a male who asked her if she ever wanted to "get
               some." Kilmer text replied back and forth several times with
               the unknown person. She said the person did not threaten her.
               The person knew that she lived with "an Indian girl." The
               person texting did not reveal that they knew what Kilmer's
               address or room number was. Neither Kilmer or her roommate have
               any idea who was texting. She said there is nobody that is
               angry with her or that has had a disagreement with her. She
               went on to tell me she knows of no males that would have done
               this as a joke or prank. Kilmer said she didn't feel safe last
               night and did not think this was a funny joke. She didn't
               report the incident until after speaking with a parent and hall
               staff. The number that appeared on caller as belonging to the
               texter is 202-618-7392. Kilmer's number is 253-732-0746. She
               was unable to send me screen shots of the messages. I searched
               Spillman and the online WSU Directory for the 202-618-7392
               number. I was unable to locate anyone associated with that
               number. According to a Google search, the 202 area code is for
               Washington D.C. I called the 202 number but the phone just rang
               and no voicemail was available. There are no suspects,
               witnesses, or leads at this time. No further investigation. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 15th day of January, 2015, in Pullman,

               domestic dispute at Chinook Apartments. A male was prying off a
               hub cap of the victim vehicle. I contacted Pullman PD because

               the prosecutor. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Keenan,
               Bryan J / 041393 Forward Charges Attmpt Mal Misch 3rd DV 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 01/15/15 at about 1549 I was dispatched to a
               possible domestic dispute at the Chinook Apartments. The
               reporting party Phoebe N. Thompson (091792) said her boyfriend
               Bryan J. Keenan (041393) was prying on the wheel of her vehicle
               with a knife. She told dispatch he left the area when he saw
               her and her roommate watching him from inside their apartment.
               I responded and found Thompson's vehicle. The hub cap of the
               rear driver's side wheel was pried loss from one side. I
               contacted Thompson at her apartment, Chinook Apartment Z121.
               She said her and Keenan had started arguing at his apartment at
               Boulder Creek. Thompson went to leave his apartment and come
               home. Keenan followed her into the parking lot and stood in
               front of her vehicle door preventing her from leaving. They
               continued to argue in the parking lot for about a minute when
               someone walked by and Keenan moved away from her door. She got
               in her vehicle and left. As she left she said Keenan pounded on
               the door window of her vehicle. Keenan then got in his vehicle
               and followed her. Thompson drove to Chinook Apt and went inside
               of her apartment. Keenan followed her all of the way to Chinook
               Apt. Thompson was concerned what Keenan would do so her and her
               roommate opened the blinds to their front window. They saw
               Keenan prying at her wheel with a knife. Keenan looked up and
               saw they were watching him and left the area in his vehicle.
               Thompson then called 911. I photographed the hub cap, and was
               able to get the hub cap put back in place. There appeared to be
               no damage to the hub cap. I contacted Pullman Police and asked
               if an officer could respond since the dispute began in their
               jurisdiction. Pullman PD Officer Burkett responded and listened
               to Thompson's description of the incident. I asked Thompson and
               her roommate complete statement forms describing the incident
               and e-mail them to me. I gave Thompson a domestic violence
               information packet and my card with the case number. I
               explained that I would be forwarding charges to the prosecutor
               for attempted malicious mischief 3rd on Keenan. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
