               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0046 SYNOPSIS: Extra patrol request for
               Cleveland Hall and the Education Addition at night because the
               RP believes a homeless person is sleeping in the building at
               night. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               010715 at approximately 0913 hours, I received a phone call
               from Beverly D. Rhoades, Cleveland Hall custodian, who told me
               that she believes someone may be sleeping in either Cleveland
               Hall or the Education Addition. Rhodes told me that there has
               been a woman dressed in all warm clothes frequenting the
               building during the early morning hours and they have been
               finding cat feces in the woman's bathroom sanitary disposal
               cans. Rhodes told me that she believes the woman may be
               sleeping in the lounge on the 3rd floor of the Education
               Addition, room 70 on the ground floor of Cleveland Hall, or in
               the basement which she could access using the elevator. Rhodes
               told me she was going to see if facilities could lock the
               elevators to make the basement restricted access, but she
               believes that the woman could be accessing that area too.
               Rhodes requested extra patrols in both buildings between 2300
               and 0700 hours. I sent an email out to all graveyard and
               swingshift officers requesting extra patrols. Nothing further.
               I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws
               of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 7th day of January, 2015, in Pullman,

    Narrative: RVWD: 316 / OFC: KDS/326 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0047 SYNOPSIS: Collision between a WSU
               van, driven by Gary E. Johnson, and a tree on Terrell Mall. I
               estimated the damage at $3000.00 for the damage. Photos taken
               the driver completed all WSU collision paperwork. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 010715 at
               approximately 1017 hours, I was dispatched to a report of a
               collision that occurred Terrell Mall, and the driver was a WSU
               employee driving a WSU owned vehicle. Dispatch advised me to
               contact Dennis Rovetto with the Motorpool for more information
               of the current location of the driver and vehicle. I contacted
               Rovetto and he told me that the driver, Gary E. Johnson, backed
               the motorpool's 2003 Ford E3 Wagon WA/17213E into a tree
               outside Todd Hall on Terrell Mall. Rovetto stated that the van
               was at the motorpool and the driver, Johnson, was at Webster
               Hall for contact. I responded to the tree and took photographs
               of the damage. I noticed there were some paint chips and tail
               lamp chips imbedded in the tree and there was some scraping.
               The tree was a large Maple tree and sustained little damage. I
               responded to the Motorpool and checked the damage to the van. I
               saw that the rear passenger side taillight and the surrounding
               body of the van sustained significant damage. The taillight was
               completely broken out and there was denting in the body
               surrounding the tail light housing. Rovetto and I agreed the
               approximate damage was around $3000.00. Rovetto stated that
               Johnson was waiting to talk to me on the sidewalk outside
               Webster Hall. I responded to the area of Webster and contacted
               Johnson who told me that he had parked the van next to another
               WSU van between two trees outside of Todd Hall on Terrell Mall.
               He parked it facing westbound and when he returned to the van
               to leave, he backed the van into the tree. He stated he was
               attempting to turn around and thought he had enough room to
               make the turn to head eastbound after backing up. I asked him
               if he completed a WSU Collision form and he stated he did. I
               asked him if he reported the damage to his supervisor and he
               stated that he went directly to his supervisor. I asked him
               what time the collision occurred and he stated it was
               approximately 0845 hours. I thanked him for his time and
               cleared. Forward to Risk Management I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 7th day of
               January, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               Lihong Zhu/042664 Infraction issued Fail to yield 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 01/07/15 at about 1705 hrs I was turning on to Terre View
               Dr. from SR 270 when I noticed a vehicle, ID 1LB3884, which was
               approaching SR 270 on Terre View Dr. The vehicle caught my
               attention because it did not have any headlights on and it was
               well past sunset. I turned around and caught up the the vehicle
               as it neared Alpine Animal Hospital on SR 270. I activated my
               overhead lights to initiated a traffic stop. After a short time
               the vehicle was still continuing to drive at about 55 MPH in
               the left eastbound lane of SR 270 and was not making and
               movements indicating an intention to pull over and stop. I
               activated my siren and the vehicle continued driving. The
               vehicle continued eastbound on SR 270 driving at or just under
               the posted speed limit until it reached the intersection of
               Pullman Rd. and Warbonnet Dr. in Moscow. At the intersection
               the vehicle was forced to stop for traffic and I began giving
               verbal commands over my PA. The driver, Lihong Zhu, exited the
               vehicle. I detained Zhu in handcuffs and placed her in the back
               of my patrol car. I read her her constitutional rights from a
               pre-printed card and advised her was being recorded. She said
               she understood her rights and waived them verbally. Zhu told me
               she saw my patrol car and lights behind her. She said she was
               scared and confused so she did not stop. She also said she
               thought there might be an emergency that I was trying to get
               around her. When asked what she was supposed to do when an
               emergency vehicle activated its lights she said she knew she
               was supposed to pull over and stop but she was scared to do so
               as she didn't know if it was safe. The highway on SR 270 is a
               four lane road, two lanes in either direction. It has ample
               shoulder room on either side of the road for a vehicle to pull
               over and stop without being a risk to traffic on the highway.
               Moscow PD officers arrived on scene and I informed them of what
               occurred. They advised they would submit Zhu to Idaho DOL for a
               re-evaluation of her driver's license. Zhu's ID driver's
               license was retrieved from her vehicle with her permission. I
               issued Zhu an infraction for driving without headlights when
               required and failure to yield to an emergency vehicle. I
               explained the infraction to her, she received her copy, and was

               driving northbound on Stadium Way near Ferdinand Ln with a
               headlight out. I turned on the vehicle and conducted a traffic
               stop. I contacted the driver Damion A J Clark (072991) and
               asked for his driver license, registration and proof of
               insurance. He gave me his driver license and proof of
               insurance. I asked again for the vehicle registration and he
               handed me the vehicle title. I asked if had registered the
               vehicle and Clark stated he thought the title was all he
               needed. I asked him how long ago he had purchased the vehicle
               and he said that it was four to six weeks ago. I checked the
