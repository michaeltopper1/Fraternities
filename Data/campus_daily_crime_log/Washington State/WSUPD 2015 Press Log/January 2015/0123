    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Whitman / 323 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0332 SYNOPSIS: Responded to a parking
               problem in the Fine Arts parking garage. A Ford pickup parked
               across two spaces blocking in the reporting party's vehicle.
               Myers Towing came and was able to move the pick up enough for
               the other vehicle to move. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR#
               1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 01/23/15 at about 1647 hours I was
               dispatched to a parking problem in the Fine Arts parking
               garage. A Ford F150 (MT/4C7842E) parked so that the vehicle in
               the next space could not move their vehicle. I responded and
               talked to the reporting party, Sarah Carpenter. She said this
               is the second time this specific vehicle had done this. The
               first time she was able to climb into the driver side from the
               passenger side and maneuver out of the parking space. This time
               the Ford had completely blocked her vehicle in and she could
               not move her vehicle without damaging it. I ran the license
               plate on the Ford and it came back as expired in November 2012.
               There was no contact information for the registered owner of
               the Ford in local records. Corporal Daniels had dispatch run
               the vehicle by VIN through all western states, no returns. I
               called for the next rotational tow. I photographed the scene
               and also a rub mark on the back of Carpenter's vehicle that may
               have been caused by the Ford. The Myers Towing tow truck
               arrived and moved the Ford enough that Carpenter could get her
               vehicle out of the parking space. I attempted to make contact
               with the owner of the Ford using the VIN, the parking permit in
               the window, and I also left my card on the vehicle. On 01/23/15
               at about 2230 hours I received a call from Johnny Le (062490).
               He asked why his car was moved and why he received a parking
               ticket. He also stated he thought his driver's side rearview
               mirror was damaged. I explained to him, his Ford was parked so
               that the owner of the other vehicle could not get her vehicle
               out. I also told him I moved the mirror in so that it would not
               be damaged while the tow truck moved his vehicle. He said he
               was not aware that he parked that close, and then state he
               thought there was enough room for the vehicle to get out. I
               then asked why the vehicle was not properly registered. Le said
               the bank was dealing with that and they told him he had the
               proper paperwork to drive the vehicle. I told Le the vehicle
               was not properly registered and that if he was pulled over
               driving the vehicle he would be arrested. Le kept stating he
               was told it was okay to drive. I again explained it was illegal
               to drive until he got it properly registered. Nothing further.

               1716 hours I was driving northbound on NE Fairway Rd. I paced
               the unregistered vehicle, a grey Toyota Camry, in front of me
               for approximately 1/4 of mile and it was consistently above 28
               mph in the 20 mph zone. I got closer and noticed it did not
               have a license plate and could not see any temporary paper. I
               activated my emergency lights and stopped the vehicle on NE
               Northwood. I spoke with the driver and informed him of why I
               was stopping him and that we were being recorded. He confirmed
               he had no insurance and that he had not registered the vehicle.
               He said he had bought the vehicle about 2 months ago. He then
               showed me a hand written bill of sale date 111514. I returned
               to my vehicle and ran the driver, Mohammed S. Alyami (090895)
               and the vehicle by VIN. Alyami was DWLS 2nd and the vehicle was
               still shown to be registered and titled to the person Alyami
               bought it from. I awaited Ofc. Olmstead as backup and once he
               arrived I had Alyami exit the vehicle. He confirmed he had had
               a suspension but thought it had been lifted. I placed him under
               arrest for DWLS 2nd and Failure to Transfer Title. I read him
               Miranda twice and he said he understood. He was placed in
               handcuffs and searched incident to arrest. I placed him in the
               back of my patrol car while I completed Sector Citation
               #5Z0226025 for DWLS 2nd and Failure to Transfer Title. I
               provided Alyami with his copy of the citation and explained it
               to him. He was released and told not to drive. Ofc. Olmstead
               had spoken with Alyami's passenger and verified he could drive.
               We cleared. Nothing follows. I certify and declare under

               welfare. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 012315 at approximately 1820 hours I passed a blue truck
               (WA/B62915X) parked on the east side of the bridge on
               Kitzmiller Rd. This is an uncommon location for vehicles to be
               parked. I briefly spoke to the driver, Julio C. Quiroga
               (121982), who said he was just hanging out. I continued on.
               Approximately 25 minutes later I drove back by the vehicle and
               ran the plate of the vehicle. I had dispatch run the RO and
               Quiroba came back with an Officer Safety warning for suicidal
               and homicidal tendencies. He had also recently been charged
               with Child Molestation. The vehicle registration was also
               expired. I requested more detail on possible methods of suicide
               or homicide via dispatch but did not hear anything back. I felt
               Quiroba needed to be checked on. I requested another unit and
               had Ofc. Whitman respond with Cpl Daniels. I met him at
               McGregor's and briefed him on the situation. We then approached
               the vehicle. I activated my spotlight and illuminated the
               vehicle. I called out to Quiroba and got no response. I used
               the PA and activated my emergency lights and got no response. I
               vehicle drove toward us and illuminated the inside of Quiroba's
               vehicle better and no one could be seen inside the vehicle. I
               had us on emergency traffic and Cpl. Daniels and I both
               deployed our patrol rifles. We had no response from the
               vehicle. Deputy Jordan was responding from Colfax. Kitzmiller
               traffic was briefly halted. Cpl. Daniels moved to the north of
               the road to see if she could see into the vehicle but could not
               gain a better vantage. We then heard a voice behind us, the
               same direction we had driven from. Quiroba was walking down
               Kitzmiller towards us in a non hostile manor. He had begun
               trying to call to us from a safe distance. He approached and
               complied with my commands to keep his hands visible. I asked
               him if he was okay based on what he was dealing with. He said
               he was okay and out for a walk. I informed him of his
               registration and recommended he park on the other side of the
               bridge and train tracks. He was free to go and we cleared. I
               then met with Deputy Jordan and informed him of what had
               happened. I later saw Quiroba turn from Pullman-Albion Rd and
               head into Pullman, he then headed east on NE Terre View. I
               returned to the station and read more detail on Quiroba. Based
               on my new information I felt it prudent to let PPD know of his
               activity. I spoke with Sgt. Dornes about what happened. I
               passed the information onto our graveyard shift and Cougar

               admitted to having marijuana in the room. He collected all the

               about 2128 hours I was dispatched to a drugs call at Waller
               Hall. The RA was reporting the odor of marijuana coming from
               room 202. I responded to Waller Hall and went to room 202. I
               could smell the odor of marijuana coming from the door jam of
               the room. I knocked on the door, after the third time I knocked
               a male answered the door. I asked the male, Robert J. Kobza
               (062796), if he knew why I was there. He said he did not. I
               said it was because of the odor of marijuana coming from his
               room. I asked if he had any marijuana in the room and he said
               he did. I asked if he was eighteen and he said he was. I asked
               if he had a medical marijuana card, he said he did not. I
               explained that since he was not 21 and did not have a medical
               marijuana card he could not legally possess or consume
               marijuana. I also explained to him, he could not possess or
               consume marijuana in his dorm room. I told him he could collect
               all the marijuana in the room and I would escort him to the
               dumpster so he could destroy it. I told Kobza I would be
               forwarding my report to student conduct. Corporal Edwards also
               asked how he was smoking the marijuana. Kobza asked if he
               should collect those items as well. Corporal Edwards told him
               to collect all paraphernalia as well as all the marijuana.
               Kobza brought out of the room, a nut can with a plastic baggy
               in it, there was a small amount of marijuana in the baggy. He
               also had a glass pipe and a marijuana grinder. I followed Kobza
               to the dumpster and he destroyed the items. I repeated the
               warnings again and asked if he had any questions. He said he
               did not. Forward to student conduct. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               5Z0226026 2. NARRATIVE: On 012315 at approximately 2352 hours I
               was behind a vehicle (WA/418ZBW) driving northbound on Stadium
               Way near Beasley Coliseum. The vehicle's driver's side brake
               light was not functioning. I activated my emergency lights and
               stopped the vehicle on NE Orchard near the NE Fairway Ln bus
               stop. I contacted the driver, Shawn L. Fuhr (032596, and told
               him why I was stopping him. Fuhr said he did not have a license
               and had only had a permit. I could smell the odor of marijuana.
               I requested Ofc. Whitman respond and he arrived shortly after
               with Cpl. Daniels. I ran Fuhr and he came back DWLS 3rd and a
               previous history involving firearms. I had him exit the vehicle
               and placed him under arrest for DWLS 3rd. He was handcuffed and
               searched incident to arrest. I read him his Miranda rights and
               he said he understood them. The odor of marijuana did not
               maintain it's potency on him. I asked if he would provide a
               breath sample for my PBT. He did so after being advised that it
               was voluntary and did not replace the evidentiary breath test.
               I had previously asked about marijuana in the car and he had
               said there was not any but the we could search. Around this
               time, 3 females showed up, and Fuhr indicated one of them was
               the owner of the vehicle. I asked which one and Aache S.
               Howard-McDaniel (12/14/93) identified herself. I advised her of
               her Ferrier Warning and she granted consent to search the
               vehicle. She stood nearby with Cpl. Daniels to revoke or
               restrict the consent. Ofc. Whitman and I found nothing of
               significance. I returned to my vehicle and completed Sector
               citation #5Z0226026 for DWLS 3rd. I issued the citation to Fuhr
               and provided him with his copy. He was released and Howard-
               McDaniel drove the vehicle away. We cleared. Nothing follows. I

               dispatched to the odor of marijuana coming from room 1225 in
               Stephenson South. I met with Hall staff and they said the room
               was still occupied. I knocked on the door and Jacob R.
               Vanwinkle (010496) answered the door. Based on his skin color,
               eyes, and tongue it was evident he was high. The window in the
               room was open and a fan was going. After asking him about
               medicinal marijuana and his age he said he still did not know
               why I was there. I instructed him and the remaining occupants

               room. Anderson was determined not to have been involved but
               should have known better than to be in the room. He has a
               previous history with us and marijuana. The other 4 admitted to
               smoking off campus and returning to Vanwinkle's room about one
               hour before. I informed them they would be referred to Student
               Conduct. I provided hall staff with the case number and
               cleared. Nothing follows. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 012415 day of

               dispatched to the report of the odor of marijuana emitting from
               Stephenson South room 417. The RP, Joshua B. McPhatter, was the
               RED on duty and had called stating he could smell the odor of
               marijuana emitting from Stephenson South 417. I responded to
               the area and went to room 417. I could smell the odor of burnt
               marijuana emitting from the room. I knocked on the door several
               times before a male, later identified as Oscar I. Deniz, opened
               the door. He appeared to have been sleeping. I asked Deniz if
               he knew why I was there. He said no. I told him that his room
               smelled like marijuana and asked if he had been smoking. He
               initally denied smoking marijana and after speaking to him for
               a few minutes he told me that he had smoked right before he
               came home. He told me that he had been home for about 30
               minutes. Deniz said that when he got home his roommate was
               already asleep and he was not invovled. I gave Deniz the option
               to retrieve whatever marijuana he had left and we would go to
               the dumpster to destroy it. He said he didn't have anything and
               if I came back with a search warrant I wouldn't find anything.
               I explained to Deniz that the information would still be sent
               to student conduct. He stated he understood. Nohting further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
