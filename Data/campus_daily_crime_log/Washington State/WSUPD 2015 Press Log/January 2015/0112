               was dispatched to a report of nuisance calls at the Terrace
               Apartments #207, located at 1401 NE Merman Drive. I contacted
               the complainant, Francis D. Boateng (DOB 02-22-1979), in the
               police department lobby. Boateng reported that he had received
               some unwanted telephone calls and text messages on his cellular
               telephone. Boateng's telephone number is 509-339-4464, and his
               service provider is T-Mobile. Boateng explained that the calls
               and text messages were received on the "WhatsApp" application
               that he had installed on his telephone. WhatsApp is a mobile
               messaging application. Boateng reported that he received two
               telephone calls on 12-30-2014 at 0023 hrs and 0025 hrs. Boateng
               did not answer the calls and the incoming, international number
               was recorded as 966569940042. Boateng reported that he received
               five incoming text messages written in Arabic on 01-12-2015
               between 1438 hrs and 1442 hrs. The incoming, international
               number was recorded as 967771434423. Boateng attempted to
               translate the messages with an online translator program and
               provided the following results: peace how khbarakm white Arabic
               I'm from Yemen my names Majid Boateng showed me the WhatsApp
               profile picture for the telephone number that had sent him the
               text messages. The profile picture consisted of an image of a
               middle eastern male and Arabic language. I photographed the
               profile picture and the record of the incoming telephone calls
               / text messages from Boateng's telephone. The photographs have
               been downloaded into Spillman and attached to this case.
               Boateng has blocked the offending telephone numbers from
               WhatsApp and his telephone. Boateng said he wanted the incident
               documented and will contact the police department if the calls
               continue. No further action at this time. Olmstead/339 I

               approximately 0021 hours I was dispatched to a drugs call at
               Stephenson North room 701. The RED on duty Ross McClure stated
               that room 701 smell heavily of burnt marijuana. I responded to
               room 701 and could smell the faint odor of burnt marijuana as I
               smelled the crack of the door. I knocked on the door for
               several minutes but nobody answered. I also could not hear any
               movement inside the room. McClure said when he first called in
               the drugs call the room smell very strongly but the odor had
               dissipated by the time I arrived. McClure provided the names of

               Charges Forwarded MIP Exhibiting 2. NARRATIVE: On 01/13/15 at
               approximately 0023 hours I was driving northbound on Thatuna
               Street and I came to a stop at the intersection of Thatuna and
               Colorado Street. I waited as a male and female crossed the
               street in front of my patrol car. The female, later identified
               as Kara Leigh Cortez 07/16/96, grabbed my attention. Cortez had
               her left arm around the back of the male and the male had his
               right arm around the back of the female. Even though Cortez was
               being assisted while walking she was stumbling in all
               directions making it difficult for the male to assist her. When
               Cortez reached the side walk she had to step up onto it. When
               Cortez stepped up she again stumbled forward. Cortez appeared
               to be under the age of 21. I passed the two and parked near
               Smith Gym. Once the two reached me I watched as Cortez was
               still having difficulty walking. I walked up to the two and
               asked if they had a second to talk. Cortez and the male
               stopped. I asked the two where they were walking to. Cortez
               said Northside Hall. I told Cortez that I had stopped to talk
               to her specifically. I told Cortez what I had observed and
               asked Cortez if she had her ID with her. Cortez provided her
               WSU cougar card. I asked Cortez how old she was and Cortez said
               18 years old. I asked Cortez a series of questions to determine
               her mental status. While asking the questions the male was
               whispering the answers to Cortez. I told the male he was
               obstructing in my investigation and I told him he must stand a
               several feet away. I told the male if he approached me during
               my investigation he would be arrested for obstructing. The male
               stated he understood. I asked Cortez how much she had to drink
               tonight. Cortez replied, "a lot I just want to go to bed."
               Cortez said she had 4 beers. I asked Cortez if I could check
               her eyes and Cortez said I could. I told Cortez to follow the
               tip of my pen with her eyes only and not to move her head.
               During the test Cortez kept moving her head in all directions
               making it very difficult to see all the signs of HGN. During
               the test I observed, equal pupil size, equal tracking, lack of
               smooth pursuit, and distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum
               deviation. Cortez's eyes were bloodshot and watery. During the
               test Cortez was swaying side to side. As Cortez stood before me
               I could smell the overpowering odor of intoxicants coming from
               her breath. I asked Cortez if she was willing to provide a PBT

               sample and Cortez said she would. I found my PBT (Alco-Sensor
               FST #16805) in working condition. The first attempt Cortez was
               not blowing into the tube. The second attempt I manually
               clicked the PBT after about one second. Cortez provided a weak
               sample of .261. Due to Cortez's high BAC I again asked Cortez a
               series of questions to determine her mental status. Cortez
               answered all my questions correctly except for the current
               month. I told Cortez that I was going to be charging her with
               MIP and Cortez said, "I agree with that." I explained the
               process to Cortez and told her she was free to go. Charges of
               MIP Exhibiting will be forwarded to the Prosecutor. END OF

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Edwards/330 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0130 SYNOPSIS: Report of a water leak.
               Housing troubleshooters were called to the scene and were able
               to turn the water off until the sink could be fixed later in
               the day. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 01-13-15 at about 0051 hours I was dispatched to the report
               of a utility problem. Whitcom advised that the resident at
               McEachern Hall room 518 said his sink was leaking and water was
               "pouring out". I responded to room 518 and contacted the
               resident, Carlos, and his girlfriend. Carlos said that he tried
               turning his sink on and when he turned the handle it blew off
               the sink and water started spraying up to the ceiling. I could
               see water was still pouring out of the handle area of the sink
               and was leaking onto the walls and floor. Carlos said he tried
               to turn the water line off but couldn't without a wrench. The
               5th floor RA (who I did not identify) called the on-duty RED
               who then called housing troubleshooters. While I was with the
               resident the handle blew off again and water was spraying up to
               the ceiling and all over the walls, dresser and vanity. Carlos
               was using all of the towels he had in his room to try and stop
               anymore water damage but it wasn't working. Once the
               troubleshooters arrived they were able to turn the water line
               off and stop the leak. He advised that the entire faucet and
               water lines would need to be fixed/replaced. He told Carlos
               that this could be done later in the day. I did not see any
               personal belongings that were damaged. I could see water on the
               walls, ceiling, dresser and sink vanity. I did not have a
               camera with me to take pictures. Carlos wanted to make sure he
               would not be held responsible for the damage, if there was any.
               I told him he wouldn't be and that I would document what
               happened. I did not fully identify Carlos, his girlfriend was
               the original RP. Request case be sent to Housing. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 13th day of January, 2015, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Corporal

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: BRW/325 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0131 SYNOPSIS: CUB staff called in an
               intoxicated male being carried by two people. The intoxicated
               male was located and taken into protective custody. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Anthony J. Burrows 07/01/96
               Protective Custody Intoxication 2. NARRATIVE: On 01/13/15 at
               approximately 0105 hours I was dispatched to an intoxication
               call at the CUB. CUB staff called in that approximately 3 to 5
               minutes prior they had seen a male being carried by two other
               people heading southbound from the CUB. The CUB staff provided
               descriptions of all three people and I found the three by
               Gannon Goldsworthy Hall. I contacted all three on the
               basketball court behind Gannon Golds. I told the three that I
               needed to talk with them. I told the group that the CUB staff
               was concerned about the well being of the intoxicated male. The
               intoxicated male was later identified as Anthony Joseph Burrows
               07/01/96. Burrows had both of his arms over the shoulders of
               the other two for support. I told Burrows that I was going to
               ask his a series of questions to determine his mental status. I
               asked Burrows what his first name was and he said Anthony. I
               asked Burrows were he currently was and Burrows spelled his
               first name. I again asked Burrows where he was and Burrows said
               outside. I asked Burrows if he knew the building he was next to
               and Burrows said Goldsworthy. I asked Burrows who the President
               of the United States was and Burrows said something
               unintelligible. I asked Burrows what month it was and Burrows
               said it was July 1st. I asked what day of the week it was and
               Burrows said January fifth. Burrows words were so heavily
               slurred it made it very difficult to understand him. I asked
               Burrows if he could stand on his own and the two let go of
               Burrows. Burrows instantly began to sway in all directions. I
               asked Burrows if he had his ID with him and Burrows reached
               into his back pocket. Burrows reached his hand forward to hand
               me his ID but he had nothing in his hand. Burrows was so
               intoxicated that he believed he was holding his wallet. I
               pointed out that his wallet was still in his pocket and he
               grabbed it out. Burrows handed me his wallet and I asked him if
               I could remove his ID. Burrows said I could. I again asked
               Burrows the same series of questions. Burrows incorrectly
               answered all the questions. Burrows believed that he was
               currently in Boise Idaho. I told Burrows that he was not under
               arrest but was in protective custody. I searched Burrows and
               found no weapons. I told the two to check with the hospital in
               a few hours to see how Burrows was doing. I transported Burrows

               to Pullman Regional Hospital where he was turned over to
               medical staff for an alcohol detox. I filled out the protective
               custody paperwork which the Doctor signed. The protective
               custody paperwork was later uploaded to the files folder. Once
               Burrows was checked in I cleared. END OF REPORT I certify and

               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
