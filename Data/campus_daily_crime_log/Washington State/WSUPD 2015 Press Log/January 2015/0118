               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0248 SYNOPSIS: Drug search warrant
               served on room 701 of Stephenson North. Charges of possession
               of marijuana less than 40 grams and MIP possession will be
               forwarded to the prosecutor. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Andrew R. Todd 09/08/95 Charges Forwarded Poss.
               of Marijuana MIP Possession 2. Collin Ross 09/01/95 Charges
               Forwarded Poss. of Marijuana NARRATIVE: On January 18th, 2015
               at approximately 2310 hours I was dispatched to a drugs call at
               Stephenson North Hall room 701. I called the Reporting Party,
               Brittany A. Griffin, who is the Hall Director on Duty. Griffin
               stated she was called to room 701 by RA's who smelled the odor
               of marijuana. When Griffin arrived on the 7th floor she could
               smell the strong odor of marijuana coming in the hallway
               outside of room 701. Griffin stated she smelled the doors
               surrounding room 701 and room 701 was the only door that
               smelled of marijuana. I asked Griffin on a scale of 1 to 10, 10
               being 100% sure, how sure was she that the odor she smelled was
               coming from room 701. Griffin said she was a 6.5. I asked
               Griffin what her reservations were about room 701. Griffin said
               the odor was not as strong as she usually smells but she
               believes that the window in the room was open to dissipate the
               smell. Again Griffin stated that 701 was the only room that
               smelled of marijuana. Griffin stated she was an 8 out of 10
               that the odor that she smelled was marijuana. Griffin stated
               that she knows the odor of marijuana because she has attended 7
               controlled burns during her employment with Universities.
               Griffin's last controlled marijuana burn was August of 2014.
               Griffin has called in 7 drug calls since November of 2014. Of
               those 7 calls, 6 calls resulted in marijuana being present in
               the room. This drugs case is the 5th drugs case at room 701
               since the beginning of the school year. There has been drug
               cases on 12/10/14, 12/18/14, 01/13/15, 01/16/15, and today's
               case. The case on 01/16/15 resulted in the two occupants
               throwing away their marijuana. The other cases the occupants
               refused to answer the door. I confirmed with Griffin that
               Andrew R Todd 09/08/95 and Marc A. Kuhlmann 08/02/96 are the
               only people listed for room 701. Todd is 19 years old and
               Kuhlmann is 18 years old. I applied for a search warrant and
               was granted one by Judge Robinson. At approximately 0025 hours
               Cpl. Edwards and I arrived at room 701 for the service of the
               search warrant. I knocked and announced saying, "WSU Police
               Department, Search Warrant." Nobody answered. I again knocked
               and announced and again there was no answer. I keyed into the

               room and found A return of service was completed and sent to
               the court. Andrew R. Todd 09/08/95 asleep in his bed. I called
               out loudly to Tood and he opened his eyes. Todd was detained in
               handcuffs and walked into the hallway. I had Todd sit down and
               I told him I had a search warrant to search his room. I read
               Todd his Miranda Rights off my department issued card and Todd
               stated he understood. I asked Todd, having his rights in mind
               did he still wish to speak with me. Todd thought about it and
               said sure. I asked Todd if he had a medical marijuana card and
               he said no. I asked who lived in the room and Todd said himself
               and Collin Ross 09/01/95. I told Todd that the RA's show a Marc
               A. Kuhlmann 08/02/96 living in room 701. Todd said Kuhlmann and
               Ross switch rooms at semester time. I provided Todd with a copy
               of the warrant and read it out loud as Todd followed along.
               Once completed I asked Todd if he was willing to tell me where
               his drugs were. Todd said the marijuana was on his desk. I
               asked Todd if I was going to find any prescription medications
               and Todd said I would find his ADHD medication but the pills
               were in his prescription bottle. Around this time Sgt. Jacobson
               arrived on scene to stand with Todd as Cpl. Edwards and I
               searched the room. During the search the following items were
               seized: -8 16oz cans of Rolling Rock Beer -3 glass pipes/bongs
               -1 metal grinder -9 glass stems and connectors -9 small plastic
               containers with hash oil residue -1 small rubber container with
               hash oil residue -5 metal vaporizer mouth pieces -1 sandwich
               bag of marijuana -1 green rubber pill box with marijuana inside
               -1 glass pipe -1 digital scale All items seized had marijuana
               or marijuana residue on it. Once the search was complete I left
               a copy of the warrant and evidence log on each side of the room
               for Todd and Ross. I went back out to Todd and told him he was
               under arrest for possession of marijuana less than 40 grams and
               MIP possession. I asked Todd if he was willing to contact Ross
               so I could talk to him about the illegal items found on Ross'
               side of the room. Todd said he would text him. I unhandcuffed
               Todd so he could put warmer clothing on. Once Todd had more
               layers on I had Todd take the 8 beers cans to the bathroom
               where he poured out the beer down the sink drain. Todd texted
               Ross but Ross did not reply. I transported Todd to the Pullman
               Holding Facility where I fingerprinted and photographed Todd. I
               told Todd that I would be forwarding charges of possession of
               marijuana less than 40 grams and MIP possession to the
               prosecutor. Todd stated he understood. Once fingerprinted and
               photographed I drove Todd back to his dorm. Once Todd was
               released from custody I cleared. Once back at the station the
               sized items were logged into evidence. The marijuana NIC tested
               presumptive positive for marijuana. Charges of charges of
               possession of marijuana less than 40 grams and MIP possession
               will be forwarded to the prosecutor on Todd. Charges of
               possession of marijuana less than 40 grams will be forwarded to
               the prosecutor on Ross. END OF REPORT I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               19th day of January, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               was at WSUPD in the report writing room when the doorbell on
               the exterior door rang. I answered the door and saw a male
               standing there. He asked me for ice. I could see his left eye
               was swollen and bloodshot. I asked him what happened. He told
               me that he was punched and that he only wanted ice for his head
               then he wanted to walk home. I asked the male what happened and
               he said that he had wandered into a "frat" because he liked the
               music he heard from the street. He said he went inside and
               asked where he could find the DJ. He said that he was only
               there for a few minutes before he was being punched by several
               males. He said he fell to the ground and did not know if he
               lost consciousness. He said he was able to get away but did not
               know the males who had attacked him. The subject was identified
               as Joshua Becker. I asked for an ambulance and PPD to respond.
               While waiting for an ambulance and PPD, Officer Westerman got a
               bag of ice for the Becker. PPD Officer Cornish responded and
               took over the investigation. PFD medics arrived and evaluated
               the Becker. Becker did not want to go to the hospital. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under

               gr NARRATIVE: On 19 January 2015 at about 0053 hours, I was
               dispatched to the odor of marijuana coming from Stephenson East
               room 1109. When I arrived the door to 1109 was partially open
               but I did not see any lights on. I met with the Hall Staff in
               the floors lounge. They stated when they arrived they were able
               to determine the odor of marijuana coming from 1109. I went
               back out to the room as Amari Franklin was returning the room.
               I asked if I could speak with him. I notice a strong odor of
               burned marijuana coming from his person. He also appeared to be
               under the influence of marijuana. I notice in his room were
               Taylor Kohrer and Melody Huerta. I asked both for their drivers
               licenses. Franklin said they had been at Flix. I could not tell
               if Kohrer or Huerta were under the influence of marijuana. I
               warned all three about Marijuana usage. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               ____ day of _____________, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.
