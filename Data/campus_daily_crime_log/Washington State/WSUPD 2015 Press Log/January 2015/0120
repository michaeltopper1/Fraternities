               subject who wished to report his cell phone stolen. I contacted
               the complainant, Randall A. Dickinson, at his residence. He
               told me he was at his Bio 330 class in Fulmer 125. He left
               class when it was over, at about 1605 hrs. At about 1630 hrs he
               returned to look for his phone, which he left in the class
               room. He was not able to find his phone. He returned home and
               went online to find the location of his phone. The GPS on the
               phone was not active but the last known location was plotting
               in the middle of the Kenwood Square apartments at about 1858
               hrs. Dickinson said his phone was a Keyocera Hydro Icon with a
               blue/black case. He did not have the serial number. I later
               looked up the phone and found its value to be approximately
               $150.00. I will be requesting day shift contact the registrars
               office to obtain a class roster for the Bio 330 class so I can
               determine if any of the people in the class live at Kenwood
               Square. More to follow. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 21 day of January,
               2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0281 SYNOPSIS: I assisted Pullman PD in
               looking for a male related to a juvenile problem. The male and
               female were not found. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               2. NARRATIVE: On 01/20/15 at approximately 2302 hours I heard
               Pullman PD being dispatched to a juvenile problem where a 16
               year old female had left the house against her fathers orders
               to "go on a date" with a 20 year old. Pullman was provided the
               license plate of the male's car and the first name of "Derek."
               Using AIMS I was able to find that the provided license plate
               was associated with a Derek E. De La Rosa 06/28/94. I located
               an address for De La Rosa at McEachern Hall room E43. I had
               dispatch advise Ofc. Cornish that I had information regarding
               his case. Ofc. Cornish called me and I told him that I couldn't
               turn over the information I found but I could assist him in his
               investigation. Ofc. Cornish said that would be great. Ofc.
               Cornish and I responded to McEeachern Hall room E34 and knocked
               on the door. Nobody answered. I listened near the front window
               and could not hear any movement inside. It appeared that nobody
               was home. Ofc. Cornish thanked me for my assistance and we
               cleared. END OF REPORT I certify and declare under penalty of

        Time Reported: 00:08
    Time Occurred between: 11:39:00 01/20/15 - 00:01:11 01/21/15

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: BRW/325 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0282 SYNOPSIS: Concerned friend called
               in about a text message she had received from Tofaagaoalii Laa.
               Laa and her boyfriend Fiaai Moliga have had a history of
               domestic violence. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 01/21/15 at approximately 0008 hours I was
               dispatched to a welfare check call in the area of the Columbia
               Apartments. I called the reporting party, Natasha S. Volkova
               who stated she had received a text message at 2339 hours from
               her friend Tofaagaoalii Laa 08/30/91. Volkova said Laa texted
               her something to the effect of, "please take my cards, withdraw
               everything from my savings and please give my family my
               belonging. You've been a great friend, I love you, tell my
               parents I love them." Laa also gave Volkova her pin number for
               her cards. Volkova texted Laa back three times but as of 0008
               hours Laa had not responded to her. Volkova stated that she
               gone to the gym with Laa earlier in the night and dropped her
               off at her apartment complex around 2130 hours. Volkova
               described the complex as the Columbia Apartments. Volkova
               stated Laa walked by the dumpsters and and down a sidewalk.
               Volkova said she did not know which building Laa went to.
               Volkova said Laa had been acting normal when she dropped her
               off so that why the text message seemed out of the blue.
               Volkova said she was worried for Laa because she is aware of
               the past history of violence between Laa and her boyfriend,
               Fiaai Robert Moliga 05/19/90. Volkova stated that Laa and
               Moliga's relationship had been rocky as of late and they share
               an apartment. I asked Volkova if Laa had a car and she said no.
               I asked Volkova if she had any other way of finding out where
               Laa lived and Volkova said no, the only why they communicate is
               by phone. I provided Volkova the non-emergency phone number for
               dispatch and asked her to call if Laa texted or called her
               back. Using Zzusis I looked up both Laa and Moliga. Zzusis
               listed both Laa and Moligia last living at McEachern Hall but
               the address had been inactivated on 01/15/15 for both parties
               which means they had recently moved out. There was no new
               address listed for Laa or Moliga. I searched AIMS and did not
               find any cars associated with either names. I had dispatch ping
               Laa's phone. Dispatch stated Laa last sent a text at 2314
               hours. The ping accuracy was very poor with a 3000+ meter
               range. The coordinates plotted approximately one mile to the
               south of Pullman. I called all the phone number associated with
               Laa and Moliga. I left messages on the voicemail of Laa asking
               her to return my call. All the phone numbers listed for Moliga

               had been disconnected. With no other options left, Ofc.
               Petlovany and I responded to the Columbia Village apartments
               and walked around. We did not observe anything out of the
               ordinary. I knocked on one apartment which had the lights still
               on and spoke to the occupants. Both occupants stated they
               hadn't heard anything unusual today. I asked if they knew a
               Samoan couple that live in the complex. One of the occupants
               stated they see a female Samoan walking through the complex
               every once in a while but did not know why she lived. I also
               spoke to two males who were doing laundry in the laundry
               building. Both male did not know of any Samoan couples in the
               complex and had not heard anything out of the ordinary. After
               finding nothing leading me to where Laa lived, I cleared. I
               looked up Laa's class schedule and found she had class today at
               1110 to 1200 hours at Bryan Hall room 402. I will have dayshift
               attempt to contact Laa at her class. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               21st day of January, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.
