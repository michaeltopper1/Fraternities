               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 011315 at
               approximately 1038 hours, I was dispatched to a report of a
               homeless person trespassing in Bryan Hall. Upon arrival, I
               contacted Amanda J. Roberts, who told me that she has seen a
               homeless female regularly in the building and she doesn't think
               she has any legitimate business in the building. I explained to
               Roberts that Bryan Hall is open to the public. If the homeless
               person isn't going into any restricted access areas or
               remaining in the building after custodial staff closes and
               locks the building, she is not doing anything criminal. Roberts
               told me she wasn't doing anything wrong, and she understood and
               would pass the information along to her supervisor. I cleared
               shortly after. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 13th day of January, 2015, in

               a hit and run complaint. Upon arrival, I contacted Lourana F.
               Swayne who told me the following. At approximately 0800 hours,
               she backed her car in the top tier of the parking lot at, and
               when she returned at 1320 hours, she noticed the front bumper
               of her car was damaged and her car was moved about six inches
               from where she parked it. She stated that there was a large
               older white pickup backed in to the space ajacent to where she
               parked earlier in the day, and she believes it may be the other
               vehicle involved. She told me she would keep an eye out for the
               vehicle and notify me if she found it. I checked the damage to
               her car and saw that the front driver's side corner was cracked
               in several places and the paint was chipping from the bumper. I
               noticed that there were skid marks to the right where the
               vehicle had slid in the gravel from the impact of the
               collision. I estimated the damage at approximately $1000.00.
               Swayne told me she has no idea who may have cause the damage to
               her car and there was no note left. I took photographs of the
               damage to her car and provided her with the case number for
               insurance purposes. Case inactive pending further leads. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 13th day of January, 2015, in Pullman,

               intoxicated subject in room 412 Olympia Hall. Officers
               responded and determined the individual was capable of caring
               for herself. Nothing further. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 01/14/15 at about 0243 hrs
               Dispatch advised of a report from hall staff at Olympia Hall
               that there was an intoxicated female in room 412 and they would
               be sending an ambulance. Officer Westerman and I responded.
               Upon arriving at room 412 I was directed to a female laying in
               a bed, later identified as Paige L. Goodman (080995). I
               contacted Goodman, who immediately sat up in the bed and began
               speaking to me. It was clear Goodman had been drinking and was
               intoxicated. She was able to tell me she was drinking whiskey
               earlier in the night and had a little more than usual. She was
               able to answer all my questions correctly and was oriented. She
               was not in need of any medical attention so I advised Dispatch
               they could have Pullman Ambulance cancel their response.
               Goodman appeared to be able to care for herself. I notified her
               suite mate, who was not identified, of the situation as a
               precaution. I told her if she did happen to hear anything
               unusual to check on Goodman and call 911 if she needed help.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 14 day of January, 2015, in
               Pullman, Washington. _______________________________________

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0150 SYNOPSIS: Report of a possible
               domestic at Goldsworthy Hall room 231. It was determined no
               assault occurred. There was a loud argument which led to loud
               make up sex. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 01/14/15 at approximately 0456 hours Ofc. Boyd
               and I responded to a possible domestic at Goldsworthy Hall room
               231. Upon arrival we met with the RED on duty, Brittany
               Griffin. Griffin directed us to room 233 where Olivia J. Kutzke
               07/21/96, had over heard the argument. I spoke with Kutzke who
               said she could hear an argument between a male and female
               through her shared wall. The argument sounded heated and Kutzke
               could hear stuff being thrown around. At one point Kutzke heard
               what sounded like a skin on skin slap. Kutzke stated she has
               heard her neighbors argue before but not like this. Kutzke
               stated that tonights argument occurred around 0430 hours. Ofc.
               Boyd knocked on the door of room 231 and Hanan A. Diriye
               03/13/96 answered the door. We told Diriye why we were called
               to her room and asked to speak with her and anybody else who
               was in the room. There was only one other person in room 231,
               Kentaro J. Tourangeau 02/27/96, who is Diriye's boyfriend. Ofc.
               Boyd interviewed Diriye as I interviewed Tourangeau. I asked
               Tourangeau what had happened. Tourangeau stated Diriye and he
               were at a party when a friend told him a girl had been looking
               for him. At the time Diriye did not say anything. Once
               Tourangeau and Diriye got home an argument started about the
               other girl. Tourangeau stated the argument "got heated" and at
               one point he grabbed a bottle of advil and threw it against the
               wall. I asked Tourangeau if at any point he put his hands on
               Diriye and Tourangeau said he grabbed Diriye by the wrists at
               one point when he was saying he would not cheat on her. I asked
               about the skin on skin slap noise and Tourangeau said he thinks
               the noise might have been part of some foreplay. I spoke to
               Ofc. Boyd who stated that Diriye had told him that no assaults
               occurred and the augment turned into make up sex. Ofc. Boyd
               stated that Diriye had said the skin on skin slap noise was
               when Tourangeau spanked her bottom. Diriye stated she had
               wanted Tourangeau to slap her and it was consensual. Both
               parties seemed embarrassed about the situation. Both were asked
               to keep their activities quieter and we cleared. The domestic
               is us unfounded. END OF REPORT I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 14th day of
