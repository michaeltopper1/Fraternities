               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0031 NARRATIVE: Geoffrey Gonzales
               (11374264) brought in a black Samsung Galaxy Note II cell phone
               with a simulated leather flit top on it. It appears to be
               similar to a phone advertised as being lost with the contact of
               a person of Cody Talley. I contacted Cody, who thought the
               phone sounded similar to her friend who had lost it. The
               friends name is Jackson Varney who is gone on break at this
               time. Cody said her friend will be back next week and she will
               have him contact us at this time. The phone's batteries are
               dead but Geoffrey who turned it in said it showed everythign in
               an Asian language just before the batteries died. This did not
               duissade Cody who said cell phones often do strange things in a
               low battery condition. I told Cody I would lock the phone up
               and Jackson could ID it when he gets back to town. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.
               Dated this 5th day of December, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.
