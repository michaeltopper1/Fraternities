               1. Kristalyn J. Kolb/03-27-96 Warned Poss. of Marijuana NA 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 01-19-15 at about 2123 hours I was dispatched to
               the report of drugs at Rogers Hall room 840. Whitcom advised
               that Brittany A. Griffin, the RED on duty, was reporting the
               odor of marijuana emitting from Rogers 840. I responded to the
               area and contacted Griffin. She told me that she could smell a
               strong odor of marijuana emitting from room 840. She also said
               that she could hear at least 2 female voices and music coming
               from the room. As I walked down the hall towards room 840 I
               could smell the odor of burnt marijuana. The odor was strongets
               at room 840. I knocked on the door several times without a
               response. As I stood at the door I could not hear any noises
               coming from within the room. I was on my way out when a
               resident down the hall asked if I was looking for "Kristalyn".
               I told her I was and she said she was in a friends room. She
               was going to show me which room she was in when she saw her
               walking down the hallway. She told me "the girl in the green
               sweatshirt" was Kristalyn. I asked the female if she was
               Kristalyn and she said yes. I asked to speak with her back at
               her room and she said ok. While talking with Kristalyn I could
               see her eyes were bloodshot and watery. Once we were back at
               the room I asked Kristalyn if she knew why I was there. She
               said no. I told her it was for the odor of marijuana coming
               from her room. She said ok and said she would go get what she
               had. I explained our process to Kristalyn and asked if she
               would be willing to retrieve anything illegal from her room.
               She said she would. I waited at the door while she went to her
               desk and got two small glass containers with marijuana in them.
               She said that was all she had. I asked Kristalyn if she had
               smoked in her room and she said no. She told me that she went
               off campus to smoke and had just returned. Kristalyn does not
               have a medical marijuana card. I told Kristalyn that I would
               follow her to the dumpster where she could destroy the drugs.
               Once at the dumpster Kristalyn put what she had in the garbage.
               I told her that this information would go to student conduct
               only. Kristalyn was very cooperative and polite during my
               contact with her. Vievu video was downloaded to the s: drive.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing

               transferred to PPD. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 01-19-15 at about 2213 hours I was dispatched to
               the report of a welfare check. The RP, Averi N. Dotson, was
               requesting a welfare check on her friend, Danisha Lee. Dotson
               said that Lee had been making suicidal statements on Twitter
               throughout the day and now her phone was going to voicemail.
               Dotson thought Lee lived somewhere in Orton Hall but did not
               know the room number. I checked zzusis for Lee's address. It
               showed that Lee used to live in Orton 637 but that has been
               inactive since May 2014. There was no other local address for
               her. I went to Orton 637 and knocked on the door to see if Lee
               might be there. There was not a name on the door and nobody
               answered. I called the RED on duty and asked if they could
               check the roster for me. They confirmed that nobody lived in
               Orton 637. There was a contact from August 2014 with an address
               of 1555 NE Merman Dr. I advised PPD of the situation and spoke
               with PPD Officer Cornish. He advised he would go to College
               Crest and check for Lee. She was not there. Ofc Cornish
               eventually found Lee at CCN. Case transferred to PPD. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 20th day of January, 2015, in Pullman,

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0264 SYNOPSIS: 4 males will be referred
               to student conduct for smoking marijuana in room 222 of Gannon
               Hall. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE 1. Colin C. Quang 09/11/95

               10/04/96 Student Conduct Poss. of Marijuana NARRATIVE: On
               01/20/15 at approximately 2319 hours I was dispatched to a
               drugs call at Gannon Hall room 222. Upon arrival I found the
               RA's already talking to the occupants of room 222. I stood in
               front of room 222 and the door was already open. There were
               three males inside the room, Colin C. Quang, Luijy J. Pierre-
               Louis, and Wisam S. Nakour. The RED stated one male, Dylan C.
               Blair had already left the room before I arrived. I asked who
               lived in room 222 and Quang said he did. I told Quang that it
               appeared that everybody had been cooperative with hall staff so
               as long as they were willing to turn over their illegal items I
               would only send the case to student conduct. Quang agreed.
               Quang grabbed a sandwich bag which had a small amount of
               marijuana in it and two glass pipes. Quang also decided to
               throw away 2 empty beers cans. Quang, Pierre-Louis, and
               Nakour's eyes were all bloodshot and it was clear that the
               three had just finished smoking. I told Nakour and Pierre-Louis
               that they were free to go and Quang and I walked to the
               dumpster. Once at the dumpster Quang destroyed his illegal
               items. I explained the student conduct process to Quang and
               told him he was free to go. Since Blair had left prior to my
               arrival, he was not contacted. END OF REPORT I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               20th day of January, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.
