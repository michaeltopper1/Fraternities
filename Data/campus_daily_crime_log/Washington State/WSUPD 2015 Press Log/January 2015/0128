               dispatch because she had not heard from her daughter in five
               (5) days. Dispatch advised the daughter had not been answering
               any phone calls from her mother. Dispatch advised the Daughter

               approximately 1020 hours I was dispatched to a welfare check on
               a WSU Student Aache S. Howard (DOB 12-14-93). Aache's mother
               Latasha L. Howard (DOB 01-31-72) called dispatch and told them
               she had not heard from her daughter Aache in five (5) days and
               she was not returning any of her phone calls. Dispatch advised
               Aache lived in Columbia Village. Officer Stewart and I arrived
               at Columbia Village to see if we could contact Aache. Aache's
               roommate Caprice N. Harris (DOB 05-25-94) answered the door and
               I told her we were looking for Aache. I assured Harris her
               roommate Aache was not in trouble we just wanted to make sure
               she was okay because Aache's mother was unable to reach her.
               Harris invited Ofc. Stewart and I inside her apartment so we
               could speak with her. Ofc. Stewart told Harris we were
               recording with our video cameras and Harris said that was okay.
               While Ofc. Stewart and I were talking with Harris trying to
               find out where Aache may be located Aache walked into the
               apartment. I gathered Aache's information and I verified she
               lived in apartment #P48 at Columbia Village. Ofc. Stewart asked
               Aache to give her mother a phone call and she did. Ofc. Stewart
               verified with Latasha that she spoke with her daughter. No
               further investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 28th day of January,

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0424 SYNOPSIS: Arrested Linda G. Allen
               (052752) for DUI. She was released as the case is pending blood
               test results. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Linda G.
               Allen (052752) Pending DUI 2. NARRATIVE: On 012815 at
               approximately 2028 hours I was driving a marked patrol unit
               northbound on N Grand Ave. As I approached Whitman St, the
               vehicle in front of me (WA/AND1644), appeared to change lanes
               in the intersection without signaling. The vehicle had been in
               the left lane and moved to the right. It then moved back to the
               left lane without signaling again. It appeared to have taken a
               long swerving maneuver. It began to swerve approximately a foot
               over the yellow line so I activated my emergency lights to stop
               the vehicle at around Cougar Country. The vehicle slowed and
               pulled to the right lane. It then proceeded to run up on to the
               curb, missing successive driveways. It would hit the curb and
               get up on it, pause, and then drive back onto the road. It did
               this 3 times until stopping at Nuevo Vallarta restaurant. I
               contacted Linda G. Allen and informed her we were being
               recorded. She provided her license registration, and WADL. She
               stated she had difficulty seeing the road and where to
               pullover. There was no precipitation and the road was bare and
               dry. It was lit by street lights. I had Allen step out of the
               vehicle and she seemed to swerve or lean when walking. I asked
               if she would be willing to perform voluntary SFST's. She agreed
               to. HGN Test I informed her that she would be following my pen
               with her eyes. I instructed her to keep her head still, keep
               her arms at her sides, keep her feet together, and to follow my
               pen with her eyes. I verified that her pupils were equal and
               that her eyes were able to track my pen equally. I tested for
               HGN and found a lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes. Allen did
               not display a distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum
               deviation. I did not see an onset of nystagmus prior to 45
               degrees in both eyes. I tested for vertical nystagmus and did
               not observe anything of note. I had to remind her several times
               to follow the pen. She would periodically take her eyes off of
               the pen and look at me. Walk and Turn Test I instructed Allen
               to place her heels together, her toes together, keeping her
               arms at her sides. I explained to her that she was to imagine a
               straight line coming out of her left foot and to place her
               right foot on that line, heel to toe. She was then told not to
               begin the rest of the test until instructed to do so, but to
               stay in the position she was in. I then told her she would take
               nine heel to toe steps down the line, then leave the front foot

               on the straight line, and take a series of small steps around
               that foot. She would then take 9 more steps back down the
               straight line. She was instructed to keep her arms down at her
               sides, watch her feet, and count her steps out loud. I asked
               her if she understood and she said she did. I demonstrated the
               test, taking 3 steps out, turning, and taking 3 steps back. I
               repeatedly explained that she would be taking 9 steps while I
               was showing her 3 steps. Allen was unable to get into the
               starting position and maintain it, even with her arms out to
               her side. We were on a flat and level surface but needed to
               turn another direction to conduct the test. She was not able to
               start from a heel to toe position. She continually missed heel
               to toe contact. She did not count her steps out loud. I lost
               track of how many steps she took. She took numerous steps
               offline. Once she took her estimated 9 steps she then walked
               backwards to her starting position. She continually used her
               arms for balance. The arms were at least 1-2 ft away from her
               body. One Leg Stand Test I instructed Allen to place her heels
               together and her toes together and her arms at her sides. I
               told her to stay in that position until I told her to begin the
               test. I explained to her that she could choose either leg to
               raise 6 inches off the ground, but that both legs needed to
               remain straight. I told her that she needed to point her raised
               foot and to keep her eyes on that foot while she counted out
               loud 1001, 1002, 1003 and so on, until told to stop. If her
               foot were to touch the ground she was instructed to pick her
               foot back up and to resume counting where she left off. She was
               told to keep her arms down at her sides. I asked her if she
               understood and she clarified the counting instructions. I
               demonstrated the test for her. Allen stood on her left foot and
               immediately could not maintain balance hopping several feet
               away from her starting position. She used her arms for balance
               throughout. I nearly had to catch her from falling. She placed
               her foot down several times. She stopped on her own before
               being instructed to do so. I told Allen the next test would be
               the PBT, I informed her it was voluntary and it did not replace
               the evidentiary breath test. At approximately 2040 hours Allen
               provided a breath sample that registered .000 on PBT #049027.
               Allen maintained she had no medical conditions or impairments.
               She stated she had only had aspirin. Her eyes were watery and
               slightly bloodshot. I placed her under arrest for DUI. I read
               her her Miranda rights and she said she understood them. She
               was placed in handcuffs and searched incident to arrest. She
               was placed in the back of my patrol car. Ofc. Whitman and Cpl.
               Daniels had arrived as backup and effected the tow of the
               vehicle. I had requested a DRE to meet me at PPD and Ofc.
               Lambley requested I call her. I did so and informed her of what
               was going on. She asked me to see if Allen would speak with
               her. Allen said she would. I transported Allen to PPD and read
               her her Miranda rights again. I then read the statement below
               that section containing the phrase "I understand my
               constitutional rights..". Allen stated she did not know if she
               needed a lawyer and I told her I could only read what I just
               read to her or have her read it. She told me to leave the
               "subject signature" blank. I then placed her in a holding cell

               and informed her we were waiting for Ofc. Lambley to arrive.
               When Ofc. Lambley arrived I explained to her what Allen
               mentioned about the lawyer and what had happened leading up to
               her arrest. She stated she would read her rights to her again
               and Allen subsequently spoke with an attorney. I left and
               returned to WSU PD to apply for a search warrant. I applied for
               a search warrant for Allen's blood and the ability to test it.
               Judge Robinson granted search warrant #SW012815A. I retrieved 2
               grey vials from the evidence room. They were marked to expire
               in 08/15. There was white powder in the vials. I then went to
               PPD where I met with Pullman Firefighter/Paramedic Jarosch,
               Ofc. Lambley, another firefighter, and Allen. I read the search
               warrant aloud. more to follow I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this ____ day of

               degree. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Allyson A.
               Wolf/012915 Arrested/booked Trespassing 2. NARRATIVE: On
               01/29/15 at about 0440 hrs Dispatch advised of custodial staff
               at Carpenter Hall reporting a homeless woman who was found in
               the 3rd floor womens bathroom as they were preparing to open
               the building. The woman was described as having a cat with her.
               I recognized the description as being consistent with a
               homeless individual, Allyson A. Wolf, who had been warned on
               two previous occasions for trespassing in buildings after
               hours. Sergeant Griffin and I responded to Carpenter Hall where
               we contacted Wolf in the 3rd floor womens bathroom. I spoke to
               Wolf and asked how many times she had been warned previously
               for being in buildings after hours. She did not give an answer
               to my question. She told me she thought the building she was in
               (Carpenter Hall) was open 24 hours. I told her the building was
               not open 24 hours and that the building hours were clearly
               marked at the entrances to the building. I advised Wolf she was
               under arrest for Criminal Trespass. I placed her in handcuffs
               (double locked) and read her her Miranda rights from a pre-
               printed card. I was initially going to issue Wolf a citation
               but determined she did not have a way to receive mail and there
               was no way to assure she would receive notification to appear
               for court. Additionally, it would be difficult to locate her
               should she not appear for court and a warrant be issued. Wolf
               was transported to the Pullman PD holding facility where she
               was placed in a holding cell. Sergeant Griffin transported
               Wolf's cat to the Whitman County Humane Society to be cared
               for. Wolf was later transported to the Whitman County Jail for
               Booking. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 29 day of January,
               2015, in Pullman, Washington.
