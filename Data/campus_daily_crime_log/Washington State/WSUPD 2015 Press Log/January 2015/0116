    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Edwards/330 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0203 SYNOPSIS: Report of theft from dorm
               room. Several items worth $419.00 reported stolen. Under
               investigation. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 01-16-15 at about 1723 hours I was dipatched to
               the report of a theft from Rogers Hall room 220. The RP,
               Mariela Castro, was requesting contact in her room. I contacted
               Castro who told me the following; she said that over the course
               of last semester she had several items turn up missing from her
               room. She said she always kept her room locked and that the
               items missing were those that could go unnoticed for a period
               of time. Castro told me that she suspects her old roommate has
               something to do with the items that have been stolen. Castro
               told me that she never had any problems with her old roommate,
               who she identified as Kynzie Hendricks, but heard third person
               that Hendricks did not like her. Castro told me that Hendricks
               moved out at the end of last semester and returned to her
               hometown of Port Angeles, WA. She said that Hendricks also
               blocked her from all of the social media sites they shared, to
               include Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. She said she does not
               know why Hendricks would have taken her belongings but said its
               the only thing that makes sense because there were big ticket
               items in her room, such as an Apple laptop and other
               electronics that were left alone. While I spoke to Castro she
               made a list of items that have been stolen. The list included
               these items: 1. NorthFace Vest (Puffy), black, size small -
               $180.00 2. Pants, green, size small - $15.00 3. Halter crop
               top, red, size small - $12.00 4. Turtleneck crop top, gray,
               size small - $12.00 5. Dr. Marten's Boots, black, size 6 -
               $130.00 6. Benefit Lipgloss, pink, $25.00 7. Kirkland Signature
               Hair, Nail & Skin Vitamins, 180 pills missing - $15.00 8.
               Havaiana flip flops, silver, size 6 - $30.00 Castro had 2
               friends, who were not identified, in the room with her while I
               spoke to her. While speaking to Castro, her male friend showed
               a picture to Castro that was posted on Facebook by Hendricks
               around Christmas time. In the photo Hendricks was wearing a
               black NorthFace puffy vest, like the one Castro reported as
               stolen. Castro told me that Hendricks never had a vest like
               that before and it could be her vest, but she was not certain.
               I asked Castro if there were any identifying marks or labels on
               any of the items stolen. She said no. I asked her what she
               would ultimately like to see happen and she said she did not
               care about the material items, she just wanted whoever was
               responsible to be held accountable. I asked Castro if there was

               any possibility that it could be somebody besides Hendricks and
               she said yes, and she did not want to blame her but nothing
               else makes sense. I will attempt to contact Hendricks. On 01-
               19-15 at about 2100 hours I attempted contact with Hendricks.
               She did not answer and her voicemail box is not set up, I could
               not leave a message. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Whitman / 323 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0204 SYNOPSIS: Dispatch reported a
               possible threatening case. I contacted the reporting party and
               they said she heard third hand information that a group of
               girls was coming to Pullman to fight her. I discussed options
               for the reporting party if she was concerned for her safety.
               Nothing Further. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 01/16/15 at about 1853 hours I was advised by
               dispatched that a female, Olivia A. Puloka (042196), wanted
               phone contact reference possible threats she received. I called
               Puloka and talked her about the situation. She said she has had
               a problem with a girl she knows from high school for the past
               two years. Puloka said the girls name is Stephanie Herra, but
               she is unsure of the spelling. Herra goes to Eastern Washington
               University in Cheney. Puloka said her most recent contact with
               Herra was when she was at EWU about two months ago visiting
               friends. Puloka was texting with a friend and Herra took that
               friends phone and contacted Puloka. Herra told her to leave
               EWU. Today Puloka heard from a third party that Herra and her
               friends were going to come to Pullman and "jump" her. I asked
               Puloka what she felt was meant by getting "jump". She said she
               thought that multiple people were going to fight her at the
               same time. I asked where this was supposed to happen. Puloka
               said she was going to a party tonight and Herra was going to
               the same party. She also thought Herra may try and lure her out
               of her dorm room using social media. I explained to Puloka a
               long term solution may be to apply for a anti-harassment order
               through the courts. I talked to her about options for her
               concerns for tonight specifically. I said she could not go to
               the party or if she did go and Herra arrived she could leave. I
               said if she decided to stay at her dorm and Herra showed up
               there and attempted to initiate something there to call 911.
               Puloka understood her options and did not have any further
               questions. Nothing Further. Officer Curtis Whitman WSU Police

               Marijuana 3. Kuhlmann, Marc A. / 080296 Warned Possession of
               Marijuana NARRATIVE: On 01/16/15 at about 1910 hours I was
               dispatched to a drugs call at Stephenson North 701. The RA
               reported smelling the odor of marijuana coming from room 701. I
               arrived and could smell the odor of marijuana coming from the
               room. I knocked on the door and Collin Ross (090195) answered
               the door. When Ross opened the door the odor of marijuana
               became stronger. I asked Ross if he knew why I was there. He
               said he did not. I told him I could smell a strong odor of
               marijuana coming from the room. I explained to Ross that he
               could bring out any marijuana and drug paraphernalia from the
               room and destroy it and I would forward a report to student
               conduct. I then explain the second option to Ross. I said I
               could apply for a search warrant and if granted by the judge I
               would search the room and any drugs I found may result in
               criminal charges. Ross said there was marijuana in the room and
               he would collect it and destroy it. I asked if anyone else was
               in the room he said his roommate and a friend were in the room.
               I asked him if they had any marijuana in the room. Ross said
               all the marijuana in the room was his. While Ross collected the
               marijuana and the paraphernalia from the room I asked the other
               two males their names. They gave me there names. I asked if
               they lived in this room or another. Andrew R. Todd (090895)
               said he lived in room 701 with Ross. Marc A. Kuhlmann (080296)
               said he lived in room 725 of Stephenson North. I asked if they
               had any marijuana in the room. They both stated they did not. I
               explained and warned all three males that they were under 21
               and could not legally possess or consume marijuana and they
               were also not to possess or consume marijuana in the dorms.
               Ross brought a glass bong and a medicine bottle of marijuana
               out of the room. I escorted him to the dumspter by Stephenson
               North. I observed him destroy the marijuana and bong and put
               them in the dumpster. Refer to Student Conduct. Officer Curtis

               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 01/16/15 at about 2010 I was
               dispatched to a possible threatening case. I contacted the
               victim, Emily M. Denniston (122894) at her friends room,
               Goldsworthy Hall room 610. Denniston said at about 1245 hours
               today she was on her way to class, and was walking on the
               bridge that passes over Stadium Way. She passed a female on the
               bridge. The female, Denniston believed to be named Jenny,
               turned and taped her on her shoulder. Denniston turned to face
               her. Jenny said "You broke Jesse's heart, I am going to break
               you". Denniston said Jenny then took off her jacket and set
               down her backpack as if getting ready to fight. Denniston said
               she got scared and ran to her classroom. I asked Denniston how
               this encounter made her feel and she said she was scared.
               Denniston said she believes Jenny is a friend of her ex-
               boyfriend, Jesse R. Velkinburg (031495). She said she was in a
               short dating relationship with Velkinburg that ended in the
               second week of December 2014. Denniston also stated she did not
               want me to contact Velkinburg. An RA Denniston had contacted
               about the incident said she would help her try and identify
               Jenny. Denniston also provided me with a name of someone who
               may know Jenny. I contacted him and he stated he did not know
               anyone named Jenny. I asked Denniston to fill out a statement
               form and e-mail it to me and let me know if she was able to
               identify Jenny. Officer Curtis Whitman WSU Police Dept Fri Jan

               01/17/15 at about 0021 hrs at about 0021 hrs I was driving
               westbound on Cougar Way when I noticed a male and female who
               were walking eastbound along the north side of the roadway
               along a construction fence. The position of the fence required
               them to walk in the lane of travel on the roadway. I noticed
               the female, later identified as Brenna N. Labriola (120495),
               appeared to be under the age of 21 and was stumbling side to
               side as she walked. I rolled down my passenger window and told
               them they should cross the street. The male crossed the street
               as asked and continued on his way. The female said, "No", and
               continued walking in the roadway. I exited my patrol vehicle
               and contacted the female, identifying myself as a police
               officer and told her she needed to stop so I could speak with
               her. She did as instructed. I had her move across the street to
               the sidewalk so I could speak with her without risk of being
               hit in the roadway. I asked Labriola how old she was and she
               said 19. I asked how much she had to drink and she initially
               said 4-5 beers. She later admitted to having had 4-5 shots. I
               could smell the odor of intoxicants on her breath as she spoke
               to me. I asked Labriola if I could check her eyes to see how
               much she had to drink and she agreed. I attempted to administer
               a horizontal gaze nystagmus test on her but was unable to do so
               because she would not follow my pen with her eyes without
               moving her head. Labriola swayed in a circular motion as I
               attempted to administer the test. Labriola provided me with her
               WA driver's license. She also tried to give me her debit card.
               I confirmed the information she provided and advised Labriola I
               would be forwarding charges for MIP Exhibiting to the Whitman
               County Prosecutor's office. As she was leaving to continue home
               Labriola stopped and bent over near the wall of the Physical
               Education Building, saying she felt like she might vomit. She
               waited there for a bit but never vomited. She continued to her
               residence at Streit/Perham. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               wallet out of his front left pocket. I asked if he had his
               driver's license that I could look at. He said he did and
               handed me his driver's license. I asked him again what his date
               of birth was and he said February fifth 1996. I asked Klees how
               much he had to drink tonight and he said too much. I asked him
               if he would provide a breath sample so I could see what his
               blood alcohol level was. He provided a sample to my ALCO Sensor
               FST (SN#102461) and it recorded a reading of .180. I performed
               the PBT in accordance with state toxicologist recommendations
               and I have been trained in using the ALCO Sensor FST PBT. I
               explained to Klees that I would be forwarding charges to the
               prosecutor for minor exhibiting the effects of alcohol while in
               public. I asked Klees where he lived and he said Gannon Hall
               425. I asked if he was going to be able to make it home he said
               he would be able to. I asked if his roommate would be there, he
               said he would. I told Klees he could go back to his dorm room.
               I decided later not to forward charges to the prosecutor for
               minor exhibiting the effects of alcohol in public. Forward
               report to WSU student conduct. Officer Curtis Whitman WSU

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0213 SYNOPSIS: Responded to report of a
               suicidal subject at Goldsworthy Hall. Contacted the subject who
               was upset about a recent break up. She stated she was not
               suicidal and was not having thoughts of harming her self. Her
               roommate was with her in her dorm room. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 01/17/15 at about 0046 hours
               dispatch advised of a possible suicidal subject at Goldsworthy
               Hall. The reporting party Kelly D. Smith (041696) said his ex-
               girlfriend Makenzie R. Taber (091495) made statements to him
               over the phone that made him think she was going to harm
               herself. He said Taber told him that "no one would care if she
               wasn't there in the morning". I responded to room 636
               Goldsworthy Hall and knocked on the door. Taber's roommate
               answered the door. I asked to talk to Taber, and she came to
               the door. Taber's eye were red and watery as if she had been
               crying. I asked if she was okay. I told her that we received a
               call from someone that was afraid she wanted to hurt herself.
               She said she was okay. Taber asked if we could speak inside her
               room. Corporal Edwards and I entered her room and her roommate
               left the room. I asked Taber if she had any thoughts of suicide
               or hurting herself. She said she did not. She said she was
               walking home from a party on greek row and while attempting to
               call a friend, called Smith by accident. She said her and Smith
               had broken up about two weeks ago and she was still upset about
               it. She said she was also busy with school and other things so
               she was stressed. When she talked to Smith she got frustrated
               and hung up. She thought that was probably what caused him to
               be concerned. I asked her if she had ever talked with a
               counselor before or if she was interested in talking to one.
               Taber said she spoke with a counselor in her hometown and had
               thought about contacting one here at WSU. I gave her one of my
               business cards which has numbers for counseling services on the
               back. Taber continue to say she was just upset, and not
               planning on harming herself. She said her and her roommate were
               not going anywhere tonight and they were going to bed. Her
               roommate came back to the room and I confirmed with her that
               she was going stay with her roommate. She said she was. I
               cleared the scene. Kelly requested phone contact after I had
               talked to Taber. I called and talked to him. I told him Taber
               appeared to be safe and not wanting to harm herself. He was
               concerned also because Taber said something happened to her at
               the party she was at. Taber did not tell me about anything that
               happened during the party she was at. Kelly said he was on the

               Rebecca N. Shelley. I responded to the area and contacted
               Shelley who showed me a picture of a penis that had been drawn
               on the door to room 827 with a dry erase marker. Shelley told
               me that she had already started to remove the graffiti with
               alcohol and water. I took a picture of the graffiti. Room 827
               belongs to Natane Ribiero-Ventura. Shelley said that Ribiero-
               Ventura had not seen the graffiti and that she was going to
               remove it before she could see it. I was also notified of
               graffiti in the 9th floor hallway. I responded to the 9th floor

               marker on the white wall. Another RA, who was not identified,
               stated she would clean the graffiti off the wall. There are no

               NARRATIVE: On 01/17/15 at about 0204 hrs I was driving
               eastbound on Campus St. near McCroskey Hall when I noticed two
               males, later identified as Tanner D. Wilburn (060195) and Logan
               N. Joy (101395), who were standing near a tree at the north
               west corner of McCrosky Hall. They caught my attention because
               Joy was standing facing the tree with his feet approximately
               shoulder width apart. He had both hands near his crotch and I
               could see what appeared to be a stream of urine going toward
               the tree from Joy. When they noticed I was driving by they both
               turned and started walking toward Veterans Way. I drove on to
               Veterans Way and contacted Wilburn and Joy near the south west
               corner of McCrosky Hall. I told them I needed to talk to them
               because I saw Joy urinating on the tree at the other side of
               the building. I warned them about urinating in public and as I
               was speaking with them I could see they both appeared to be
               under the age of 21. I could see they both had bloodshot and
               watery eyes. I asked them for their ID's. They each provided
               their driver's license, which confirmed they were under 21. I
               asked how much they had to drink and they both admitted to
               having consumed alcohol. They each agreed to let me look at
               their eyes. I administered a horizontal gaze nystagmus test on
               them and observed they both had a lack of smooth pursuit and a
               distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation. I could
               smell the odor of intoxicants on their breath as I administered
               the test on each of them. I advised them I could arrest them
               for MIP but I would be sending them to student conduct only.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 17 day of January, 2015, in
