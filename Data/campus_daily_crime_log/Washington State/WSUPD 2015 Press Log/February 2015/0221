               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0863 02/21/15 SYNOPSIS: Hit and run
               collision on Terrell Mall. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR#
               1. 2. NARRATIVE: On February 21, 2015 at about 1237 hours I was
               dispatched to a hit and run collision that occurred on the
               Terrell Mall in front of Holland Library. Andaya M. Sugayan
               (01/24/95) witnessed the collision and she called police from
               the red public telephone outside of the WSU Police Department.
               I contacted Sugayan at her residence in Chinook Village. She
               told me she was walking on the Terrell Mall when she saw a
               large gold SUV back into a light pole near Holland Library. She
               said the male got out and looked at the damage. She described
               the male driver as being about 40 years old and Asian. The
               driver talked to Sugayan asking her for the police. She
               provided him instructions on where the WSU Police Department
               was located. Sugayan watched as he drove into the lower parking
               lot at the WSU Police Department. The driver got out and walked
               to the front door of the police business office. The office is
               closed on nights and weekends but there are instructions on the
               door for contacting the police via the red courtesy phone
               located next to the front door. Sugayan said the driver gave
               her a business card from his insurance agent and wrote his
               first name and telephone number on it. The driver said
               something about being in a hurry and left. He was difficult to
               understand said Sugayan. She was left holding the business card
               with a first name and telephone number. The male had written
               "Song 509-432-5478" on the back of the card. Sugayan read the
               instructions on the front door and called the police to report
               the incident. She is a WSU student and has no relationship with
               the police department. She does not work for the university in
               any official capacity. She gave me the business card. I have
               scanned it into the case. Sugayan did not have a complete
               license plate but provided Whitcom the following partial
               Washington license plate: AFF11. I found the light pole on
               Terrell Mall that has been damaged. The pole is leaning
               slightly but does not appear to be in any danger of falling. I
               notified WSU Facilities Operations dispatch about the pole. I
               photographed the damage to the pole. I estimate the damage at
               $500.00. I searched Spillman for the telephone number "509-432-
               5478" locating a names file for Song Hui Yi (08/07/62) of
               Pullman, WA. Using DAPS I located a 2004 beige Ford Explorer,
               AFF1180/WA registered to Yi. I have not contacted "Song" nor
               has he made contact with the police. The investigation
               continues. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under

               Laura Claire Forman 06/21/96 Charges Forwarded MIP Exhibiting
               2. NARRATIVE: On 02/21/15 at approximately 2335 hours Ofc.
               Whitman and I were traveling eastbound on Cougar Way near the
               Old Bookie when I noticed a female walking westbound on Cougar
               Way. The female, later identified as Laura Claire Forman
               06/21/96, was stumbling side to side as she walked. Forman was
               weaving while walking, taking up almost the whole side walk. I
               had Ofc. Whitman pull into the Smith Gym parking lot so I could
               observe Forman. I exited the car and as Forman approached my
               location she was still stumbling as she walked. As Forman
               neared, I noticed she appeared to be under the age of 21. When
               Forman reached me I asked her if she had a second to talk and
               Forman stopped. I asked Forman where she was walking to and
               Forman said Streit Perham. I told Forman the reason I had
               stopped to talk to her and asked Forman if she had her ID.
               Forman provided her Oregon Driver's License which identified
               her as 18 years old. I asked Forman if I could look at her eyes
               and she said I could. I told Forman to stand with her heels and
               toes together and follow the tip of my pen with her eyes only,
               keeping her head still. As soon as I moved my pen Forman moved
               her head to follow. I reminded Forman to keep her head still
               and only follow the pen with her eyes. Throughout the test
               Forman was not following the pen but rather, staring past my
               shoulder. During the test Forman was swaying side to side. At
               one point Forman began to lean to her left so much that she
               stumbled backwards. Due to Forman not being able to follow my
               instructions I stopped the test. During the test I was able to
               observe, equal pupil size, equal tracking, and lack of smooth
               pursuit. I asked Forman how much she had to drink and Forman
               said 4 to 5 shots. I asked how long ago was her last drink and
               Forman said 6 hours ago. I asked Forman if she was willing to
               provide a PBT sample and Forman said no. I told Forman that I
               believed that her last drink was more recent than 6 hours ago
               based on what I had observed. I asked Forman to blow into my
               hand. As Forman did I could clearly smell the strong odor of
               intoxicants on her breath. I told Forman that she was under
               arrest for MIP Exhibiting and handcuffed (D/L) her. I told
               Forman that she was being audio and video recorded and read
               Forman her Miranda Rights off my department issued card. Forman
               was searched incident to arrest and nothing of evidentiary
               value was found. I placed Forman in the backseat of my patrol

               car while I researched her name. I found that Forman had not
               been contacted for alcohol or drugs before. Due to Forman's
               intoxication level I decided it would be best to provide Forman
               with a courtesy transport to her dorm. Once at Perham Hall I
               told Forman that I would be forwarding charges of MIP
               Exhibiting to the Prosecutor. Forman stated she understood.
               Forman was released from custody and walked into her dorm. END

               22-15 at approximately 0107 hours Officer Olmstead and I were
               on patrol on Veterans Way. I observed a male walking southbound
               on Veterans Way having trouble walking. The male was stumbling
               left and right and almost fell down multiple times. The male
               walked into a cement planter and almost fell down again. I
               decided to contact the male to check his welfare and make sure
               he was not going to get hurt. Ofc. Olmstead and I got out of
               the patrol vehicle and went to contact the male, who was now on
               the east side of Morrill Hall, located at 335 NE Veterans Way.
               I approached the male and said "police stop", and the male
               continued to walk away. As I walked closer to the male, I could
               see his face, and he appeared to be under the age of 21. The
               male looked at me with a blank stare and continued to walk
               away. I said "police stop" two more times, and the male
               continued to walk away so I grabbed ahold of his right arm.
               Ofc. Olmstead grabbed his left arm and we escorted the male
               subject down to his knees. As we were escorting the male down I
               activated my Vievu camera. I was able to put a straight wrist
               twist lock on the male's right arm, while Ofc. Olmstead
               maintained control of the male's left arm. I handcuffed the
               male (double locked), and I advised the male he was not under
               arrest at the moment, he was just being detained. Ofc. Olmstead
               and I had the male subject sit on the ground. Cpl. Daniels
               arrived as a backup officer and advised the male he was being
               video recorded. I told the male I stopped him because he was
               having trouble keeping his balance and almost fell over
               multiple times. I read the male subject his Constitutional
               Rights from my department issued card. The male told me he
               understood his rights, and he invoked them. I noticed he had a
               flushed face, and his eyes were watery and droopy. I could also
               smell the odor of intoxicants coming from the male's breath.
               While asking the male for his name, he kept slurring his
               speech. The male had a hard time paying attention and answering
               my questions. The male finally identified himself as Harrison
               Z. Knechtel (DOB 11-08-95). I had to ask Knechtel multiple
               times before he was able to provide me with his date of birth.
               I had Dispatch run Knechtel for any wants, and he came back
               clear. I told Knechtel he was under arrest for MIP. Cpl.

               Daniels reminded Knechtel he was being video recorded, and I
               searched him incident to arrest before placing him in the back
               of my patrol vehicle. I gave Knechtel a ride to his residence
               at 1225 SE Stadium Way, Stephenson North, room #931. Knechtel
               was released, and I told him he would be arrested again if he
               came back outside tonight still intoxicated. I also told
               Knechtel I would be forwarding charges to the Whitman County
               Prosecuting Attorney's Office. Knechtel said he understood, and
               Ofc. Olmstead and I watched as he went inside Stephenson North.
               The Vievu video was downloaded into the permanent digital
               evidence file. No further action at this time. I certify and

               about 0130 hours I observed a female walking on the sidewalk on
               the north side of Cougar Way. She appeared intoxicated, she was
               walking from side to side on the sidewalk unable to walk
               straight. I parked at the Smith Gym parking lot as she was
               crossing the street to the south side of the street. I asked
               the female, later identified as Lora C. Sullivan (032596), if
               she would stop and talk to me, she said she would. I asked if
               she had been drinking she said she had not. I asked if she
               would breath into my hand, she did and I could smell a strong
               odor of intoxicants coming from her breath. I asked Sullivan if
               she had identification I could look at, she handed me her WSU
               ID. I asked her what her date of birth was and she gave it to
               me. She was 18 years old. Sullivan's speech was slurred while
               she talked to me. I asked Sullivan if I could do an eye test to
               check her level of intoxication. She said she would. I
               conducted the horizontal gaze nystagmus test with Sullivan. She
               had lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes, distinct and sustained
               nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes, and onset of
               nystagmus prior to 45 degrees in both eyes. Sullivan also had
               vertical nystagmus. While I was conducting the test Sullivan
               was also swaying from side to side. I asked if she would
               provide a sample to the PBT she said she did not want to. I
               told Sullivan I was going to give her a warning, and that I
               would be forwarding my report to student conduct. I cleared the
               contact. Forward to student conduct. I certify and declare

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Edwards/330 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0877 SYNOPSIS: Report of an elevator
               alarm. Upon arrival I found the cougar card reader inside the
               elevator had been damaged. Elevator was put out of service.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 02-22-
               15 at about 0255 hours I was dispatched to the report of an
               elevator alarm. Whitcom advised that there was one person in
               the elevator that advised they accidentally hit the emergency
               button and that there was no problem. I responded to the area
               and checked the elevator. Inside the elevator I found that the
               card reader attached to the wall had been ripped off. There
               were wires hanging out of the wall. I tried to use the card
               reader. After several attempts it did read my card, but I was
               concerned about the wires hanging out of the wall. I asked
               Whitcom to contact housing troubleshooters to put the elevator
               out of service, which they did. I also asked them if they
               identified the person that had been in the elevator when the
               emergency call came in, they said no. I took pictures of the
               damage and later uploaded them to the Spillman Files. Request
               this case be transferred to dayshift in order to work with the
               Cougar Card center to identify who used the card reader just
               prior to the emergency call. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 22nd day of
               February, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.
