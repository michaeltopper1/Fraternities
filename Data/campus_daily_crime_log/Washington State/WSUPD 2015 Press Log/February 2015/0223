               I responded to a drugs call at Regents Hall. Upon arrival I met
               with the RED on duty, Charles Beckers. Beckers said when he
               first arrived at room 403 he could smell the strong odor of
               marijuana in the hallway so he called in the drugs call. While
               waiting for me to arrive the sole occupant for room 403 came to
               Beckers because she had locked herself out of her room. The
               female was let back into her room and Beckers said there was no
               odor of marijuana coming from room 403 when he opened the door.
               Beckers said he did not know where the odor was coming from and
               there was no longer any odor in the hallway. I walked the 4th
               floor of Regents Hall and located no odor of burnt marijuana. I
               told the RA's to call back if they came across the odor again.
