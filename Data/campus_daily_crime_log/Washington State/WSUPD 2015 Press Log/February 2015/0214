               approximately 1110 hours I found two vehicles blocking the
               emergency access road running behind Scott-Coman Halls. The
               road allows for fire apparatus to access two fire hydrants on
               the north side of Scott-Coman. The vehicles completely blocked
               any access and it is clear a road continues behind the
               buildings. There was no local contact information for the
               registered owners in Spillman. I issued both vehicles an
               infraction for a "No Parking Zone" violation and noted on the
               infractions that a Fire Zone violation would have been
               appropriate as well, but wanted to give a lower fine. I left a
               copy on each vehicle and took a photo of the vehicles' location
               and saved it to the case. Nothing further I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of

               hours Officer Olmstead and I were on patrol when I observed a
               blue, 2006 Dodge Stratus (WA Lic. AQU7517) heading eastbound on
               Valley Rd. Ofc. Olmstead and I noticed the vehicle's driver
               side headlight was defective. I activated my emergency lights,
               and I stopped the vehicle for the above described violation on
               Terre View Drive near the Campus Commons North Apartments, 1920

               the driver of the vehicle who was identified as Case G.
               Wagemans (06-19-95) by his WA driver's license. I told Wagemans
               I pulled him over because his driver's side head lamp was out.
               I went back to my patrol vehicle, and I asked Dispatch to run
               Wagemans for a records check. Dispatch advised Wagemans' WA
               driver's license was suspended in the third degree. Cpl.
               Daniels arrived on scene as a backup officer. I went back and
               contacted Wagemans and asked him to step out of the vehicle. I
               told Wagemans he was under arrest for driving while license
               suspended in the third degree. I handcuffed Wagemans (double
               locked). I searched Wagemans incident to arrest, and I placed
               him in the back of my patrol vehicle. I read Wagemans his
               Constitutional Rights from my department issued Miranda Warning
               card. I issued Wagemans criminal citation #9051 for driving
               while license suspended in the third degree. I provided
               Wagemans with his copy of the citation and explained the
               instructions on the citation. Wagemans was released. Cpl.
               Daniels contacted the three (3) passengers in the vehicle, one
               of which was the registered owner of the vehicle. The vehicle
               was parked in the apartment complex parking lot. My Vievu video

               15-15 I was traveling east on Cougar Way when I saw a female,
               Later identified as Kendall T. Johansen, standing waiting for
               the crosswalk sign to change. I could see that she was having a
               hard time standing. She was swaying back and forth badly. I
               turned on my body camera and exited my patrol car. I asked
               Johansen if she was ok and she said she was. I could smell a
               very strong odor of intoxicating beverages coming from her
               breath as she spoke, her eyes were bloodshot and watery, and
               she was having a very hard time standing. At one point in time
               she tried to lean against me to keep her balance. I asked her
               if she would be willing to provide a breath sample and she said
               she would. I used my Alco-Sensor PBT serial number 16806 and
               obtained a reading of .179. I told her since she had not been
               contacted for an alcohol violation before I was going to refer
               her to student conduct. I told her to expect to be contacted by
               student conduct. I asked her several questions to test her
               intoxication level and she answered them correctly. I asked her
               if she would like a ride to her residence and she said she
               would. She said she was living in 404 Regents Hall. I gave her
               a courtesy ride there. When I left she had entered the building
               and was walking towards her room. Refer to student conduct.
               Nothing further.......... I certify and declare under penalty

               Assault NARRATIVE: On 02-15-15 Myself and Cpl Edwards were
               dispatched to a Citizens Dispute in the Northside Residence
               Hall. Upon out arrival we met the R/P Kelsie Holtzlider. She is
               the R/A on duty. She stated that she had received a report from
               a resident that there was a fight between two males in the
               elevator and now there is blood in the elevator and adjacent
               hallway. Upon our arrival we saw blood in the elevator and on
               the floor of third floor. Holtzlider stated Peyton Pelluer and
               Drew Springfield were the two fighting. Springfield had been
               the one bleeding. We went to Springfield's room and knocked
               several times. Fearing that he my have been seriously wounded
               we announced that we were entering the room. We keyed in, but
               Springfield was not there. Holtzlinder said he may be in Andre
               Dillards room. We went to 236 and knocked. Dillard answered the
               door and Springfield was there. We asked if he was ok and to
               see the injury. He showed us a small cut on the side of his
               right hand. There was no other damage to either hand. It did
               not look as if it was the wound that cause the amount of blood
               we found. I asked Springfield to explain what had happen. He
               stated that he was in the lobby area when he ran into Pelluer.
               Pelluer was intoxicated and started calling Springfield a
               "Faggot". He asked him several times not to call him that, but
               he told him several more times that he was a "Faggot." It made
               Springfield mad so he walked over to him, got face to face with
               him, and told him again not to call him that. That's when
               Springfield turned around and walked away. When his back was
               turned Pelluer threw a back of mini-pretzels at Springfield
               striking him in the back of his head. The really made him mad.
               The tow got in a pushing match and Springfield admitted to
               striking Pelluer in the face with the palm of his hand. This
               was probably when he cut his hand. the two disengaged and
               Springfield walked away.He said that Pelluer's nose was
               bleeding when he left the area. Springfield stated that he went
               to his room and locked the door. A short time later Pelluer,
               (Albert) Connor Simpson, and Zaire Andre came knocking on his
               door. The unscrewed his peep hole. They could see in his room,
               but Springfield kept quite until they left. A short time later
               fearing they would come back Springfield went to Andre Dillards
               room. He went there hoping he could get Dillard to help him.

               Dillard let him stay there. I asked Springfield if this was the
               first time Pelluer had harassed him. He said that it has been
               going on since summer camp. Pelluer has been calling him names
               since then. Springfield said he doesn't know why but he
               continues to do it. I asked him if Pelluer struck him during
               the altercation and he said he hadn't. At that time Andre
               Dillard said that before Springfield came to his room Pelluer
               came to his room and beat on the door. Dillard answered the
               door and Pelluer demanded to know where Springfield was.
               Dillard said he wasn't going to tell him. Pelluer then told him
               "Well Your A Faggot Too." Pelluer then turned to got, but all
               of a sudden he turned around and moved as if he was going to
               punch Dillard. He stopped just short and Dillard flinched.
               Pelluer then told Dillard "Your a Fag for flinching" then left.
               I asked the two if Pelluer was always like this and they said
               most of the time, but it gets worse when he drinks. I asked the
               tow if they would write me written statements about the
               incident. They said they would and I gave them my business
               card. I told Springfield that he would be hearing from student
               conduct about the incident. He said that was fine and we ended
               our conversation. Edwards and i went to Andre's, Simpson's and
               Pelluer's rooms. No one answered their doors. I photographed
               the blood spots. They were on the elevator and down the hallway
               of the 3rd floor. There was blood on papertowels in the 3rd
               floor hallway and in the 3rd floor mens bathroom. The
               photographs were entering into spillman. Hall staff called the
               troubleshooter and they cleaned up the blood. At 0900 I
               returned to the hall and knocked on the doors again. Again
               there was no answer. I am goung to have swingshift attempt to
               contact Zaire Andre, Connor Simpson and Thomas Pelluer in the
               evening to get their side of the story. More to
               follow........... I certify and declare under penalty of
