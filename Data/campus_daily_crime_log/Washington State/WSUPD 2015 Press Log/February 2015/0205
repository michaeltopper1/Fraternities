               approximately 1017 hours, I was dispatched to contact Kappy
               Brun at the SW corner of French Administration building
               regarding old bikes parked there. Upon arrival, Brun told me
               there were two bikes that were locked up together and had been
               there since October of 2014. Brun stated that typically they
               cut the locks on the bikes and take them to WSU Surplus, but
               the surplus department wanted to make sure the bikes weren't
               stolen first. I was able to see the serial number on one of the
               bikes and I checked it through NCIC for stolen which returned
               clear. On the other bike, Brun told me she wasn't ready to cut
               the lock and would get in touch with me when they were. I will
               check the other bike's serial number at that time. Nothing

               at WSU Museum of Anthropology, no emergency. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 02-05-15 at
               approximately 1042 hours WSU Officers were toned out to a
               burglary alarm at the WSU Museum of Anthropology in College
               Hall. Officer Stewart responded with WSUPD Intern Trevor Wolff
               in one vehicle. Ofc. Jones and I responded in a separate
               vehicle. When we arrived on scene Ofc. Stewart told Intern
               Wolff to watch the NE exit of the College Hall. Ofc. Jones went
               to grab the building keys while Ofc. Stewart and I made entry.
               As soon as Ofc. Stewart and I entered the WSU Museum of
               Anthropology we saw two females in the room. The females
               identified themselves as Wanjiru I. Ndambiri (08-17-93) and
               Guadalupe Zavala (09-18-90) who both said they were setting up
               for a meeting and did not know the alarm code. Ofc. Stewart
               explained to them if it ever happens again they should wait
               outside of the building so they can notify law enforcement when
               we arrive. I tried asking dispatch if either Ndambiri or Zavala
               were on the list of responsible's, but dispatch said they did
               not have a responsible's list for the Museum of Anthropology.
               Diane C. Curewitz (09-17-46) walked in the door and Ofc.
               Stewart and Ofc. Jones recognized her as one of the
               responsible's. Ofc. Stewart told Curewitz dispatch does not
               have a copy of their responsible's list. Curewitz said she
               thought she had given dispatch a copy, but she will make sure
               to send them it again. We cleared the scene, no emergency. No
               further investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 5th day of February,

               NARRATIVE: On 02-05-15 at approximately 1121 hours Officer
               Jones and I were dispatched to the front lobby of WSUPD to take
               a report of a theft that occurred at Hillside Cafe. Ofc. Jones
               and I contacted Nicholas J. Gallucci (05-01-96) who wanted to
               report his wallet being stolen on 01-29-15 at approximately
               1700 hours from Hillside Cafe. Gallucci told me he went to get
               dinner at the Hillside Cafe around 1700 hours and he set his
               tray down on the table along with his wallet. Gallucci said he
               turned around to speak with some friends for a couple minutes
               and when he turned back around his wallet was gone. I asked
               Gallucci if his friends saw anybody walk over to his table at
               all and he said they did not. I asked Gallucci if he saw
               anybody that he remembers looking suspicious in Hillside Cafe
               and he said no. I asked Gallucci if he could describe his
               wallet for me and he told me it was made by his uncle out of
               alligator leather and it was brown in color. Gallucci told me
               it was a bi-fold wallet, but it has a second flap for money
               hidden on the inside which really makes his unique from others.
               Gallucci told me the wallet costs approximately $80. I asked
               Gallucci what else was in his wallet and he told me his WA
               drivers license (OLN: GALLUNJ049KA), insurance card, cougar
               card #11416298, WSECU debit card and $10. Gallucci told me he
               thought there was one (1) $5 bill and five (5) $1 bills, but he
               was not positive. Gallucci also told me when he called his bank
               to report his debit card as stolen there had been a fradulent
               charge on the card. The bank told Gallucci the charge was from
               Streit Perham for $11.57, but they had already refunded it to
               his account. Gallucci said the charge on his card happened
               immediately after his card was stolen. Report not finished. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this ____ day of _____________, 2015, in

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0559 02-05-15 SYNOPSIS: Theft of iPad's
               at Bohler Gym. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 02-05-15 at approximately 1211 hours Ofc. Jones
               and I went to Bohler Gym to take a theft report of two (2)
               stollen iPad's. Ofc. Jones and I spoke with Philip M. Honeywell
               from the Student Athletic Department. Honeywell showed us the
               15 boxes of iPad's they had delivered to the Student Athletic
               Department. There were supposed to be five (5) iPad's per box
               for a total of 75 iPads, but they only had 73. The serial
               numbers for the two stolen iPads are: DMPP4L9DG5W1 and
               DMPP4L9BG5W. They are iPad Air 2, 128 GB, space gray in color
               with a model #A1566. Honeywell said each of the iPad's cost
               $750 for a total of $1500 in stolen iPad's. Honeywell said the
               iPad's were delivered sometime in the afternoon on 02-03-15 and
               the boxes were locked up in the Student Athletic Department
               Office in Bohler Gym. Honeywell said they opened the boxes on
               02-05-15 and that is when they noticed two of the iPad's were
               not in the box. Honeywell showed us the box which was missing
               the two iPad's and I took photographs of the box and the
               shipping labels. The box appeared to have cut marks on it like
               someone used a knife to open the box before resealing it. Ofc.
               Jones and I went to Receiving and Delivering on WSU Campus to
               see if they could give us any more information on the boxes
               delivered. Ofc. Jones and I spoke with Brady K. Allen (03-12-
               68) who was able to give us a copy of their delivery and
               shipping manifest sheet. Allen told us the driver was Thomas C.
               Senter (01-21-66) on 02-03-15 when the boxes were delivered.
               Ofc. Jones and I spoke with Senter who said he remembers the
               box being sealed when he delivered it. Allen told us he would
               follow up with UPS about the missing iPad's. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of

               informed me he saw several individuals going into the Zen
               stairwell in the Fine Arts parking garage. I responded to the

               entrance of the southwest stairwell, known as the "Zen"
               stairwell. I could hear the sounds of spray paint cans and
               people talking through the door. I opened the door and saw two
               females spray painting the walls of the stairwell. I asked them
               if there was anyone else in the stairwell. They said there were
               others up the stairs. I told them to walk upstairs and I would
               talk to all of them at once. There were six people total in the

               they were doing in the stairwell. They said they had just come
               from a meeting of there church group and had planned to spray
               paint in the stairwell after the meeting. I asked if they had
               been drinking or doing any drugs. They said they had not. I
               could not smell an odor of intoxicants or marijuana coming from
               them. I explained to all of them that spray painting in the
               stairwell is consider malicious mischief and is misdemeanor in
               the state of Washington. They all said they understood. I told
               them I was going to let them go with a warning, but if they
               were contacted in the future for the same thing they would most
               likely be arrested. Warned. Nothing further. I certify and

               They were identified as Aaron T. Huse and Wyatt L. Fick. I told
               them they had two options and explained to them they could
               retrieve their illegal items and I would go outside with them
               and destroy them. Or I could apply for a search warrant, which
               may or may not be granted. They agreed to gather their
               marijuana and destroy it. Fick retrieved a mason jar with
               approximately 5 grams of marijuana inside. Huse retrieved a
               solo cup containing about a gram of marijuana. I walked outside
               with them and observed them destroy the marijuana. I advised
               them the incident would be referred to student conduct only.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 06 day of February, 2015, in
               Pullman, Washington. _______________________________________

    Narrative: RVWD:MJG/309 / OFC: Boyd/335 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0570 SYNOPSIS: Subject contacted for MIP
               Exhibiting. Charges forwarded to the Whitman County Prosecutor
               and Student Conduct. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               Brooke K. Bofto/100695 Fwd. Chgs. MIP Exhibiting 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 02/06/15 at about 0030 hrs I was driving westbound on Linden
               St. approaching B St. when I noticed three females who were
               walking eastbound on Linden St. toward me. They caught my
               attention because one of the females, later identified as
               Brooke K. Bofto (100695), appeared to be under the age of 21
               and was clearly intoxicated. Bofto was stumbling side to side
               as she walked, while receiving assistance walking from her
               friends. Bofto's skirt was hiked up to just below her waist,
               exposing her underwear. She was wearing one sock, no shoes. She
               had apparently fallen down somewhere because her nylons were
               ripped, she had mud on her arm, and one knee was skinned and
               bleeding. I stopped and contacted the group as they were
               walking in front of Duncan Dunn Hall. I asked where they were
               going and they said Wilmer Davis Hall, where Bofto lived. I
               asked Bofto how much she had to drink and she admitted to
               having consumed alcohol. I could smell a strong odor of
               intoxicants on her breath as she spoke. I asked Bofto if I
               could check her eyes to see how much she had to drink and she
               agreed. I attempted to administer a horizontal gaze nystagmus
               test on her but was unable to do so as she almost fell over
               when I began to administer the test. I asked for her ID and
               Bofto provided me with her WSU Student ID and her date of
               birth, which confirmed she was under 21. I confirmed the
               information provided through Dispatch. I advised Bofto I would
               be forwarding charges for MIP Exhibiting to the prosecutor's
               office and she was released to her friend, Tiffany L. Champagne
               (051796), who appeared sober and able to care for Bofto. The
               third female appeared sober and was not identified. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 06 day of February, 2015, in Pullman,

               Nicholas L. Chambard/111594 Fwd. Chgs. MIP Exhibiting 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 02/06/15 at about 0108 hrs I was driving
               eastbound on Cougar Way when I noticed a male, later identified
               as Nicholas L. Chambard (111594), who was walking eastbound
               past the lower soccer field. Chambard caught my attention
               because he appeared to be under the age of 21 and was having
               difficulty walking ,stumbling side to side as he walked. I
               stopped and contacted Chambard as he was passing the
               construction area for a new dorm across Cougar Way from PEB. I
               asked Chambard where he was going and he said to Northside
               Hall. I asked how much he had to drink and he admitted to
               having had a little bit of alcohol. As I spoke with Chambard I
               observed he swayed side to side as he stood. I could smell the
               odor of intoxicants on his breath as he spoke. I asked Chambard
               if he had his ID with him and he provided me with his WA
               driver's license, which confirmed he was under 21. I asked if I
               could check his eyes to see how much he had to drink and he
               agreed. I attempted to administer a horizontal gaze nystagmus
               test but was unable to do so because Chambard would not keep
               his head still. I observed Chambard had bloodshot and watery
               eyes. I advised Chambard I would be forwarding charges to the
               Whitman County Prosecutor's office for MIP exhibiting and he
               was released. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 06 day of
               February, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.
