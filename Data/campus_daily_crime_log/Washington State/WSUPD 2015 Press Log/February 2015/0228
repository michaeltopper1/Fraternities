               North, located at 1225 SE Stadium Way. Dispatch advised that a

               scene and located the vehicle, which was identified as a white,
               1993 Mitsubishi sedan (WA Lic. AAZ7446). The vehicle was parked
               in a space that was signed as reserved for the hall director.
               The vehicle was displaying a WSU parking permit, but the permit
               did not allow for it to be parked in a reserved hall director's
               space. I issued the vehicle parking ticket #148287 and cleared
               the scene. No further action at this time. Olmstead/339 I

               Haynie 09/27/93 2.Ruddy S. Aladina 02/18/90 NARRATIVE: On
               02/26/15 Det. Lambley notified me of a case she handled that
               occurred in WSUPD jurisdiction. Det. Lambley provided with the
               case number 15-P01841 and told me she did not believe any crime
               occurred. I reviewed Det. Lambley's case and learned the
               following. On 02/24/15 Isabel Haynie emailed Det. Lambley and
               reported that on 02/20/15 in the evening she was closing the
               Valley Road playfields and Rudy Aladina drove. Haynie said she
               recognized the car and Aladina slowed down. There was no
               specification if Haynie could see Aladina driving the vehicle.
               Haynie also reported that on 02/21/15 in the morning she was
               walking through the parking lot of the SRC. Haynie said as she
               was crossing the lot, she crossed in front of Aladina, who
               slowed down and stared at her. Haynie said she went into the
               SRC and went about her business. Haynie said while she was in
               the SRC she saw Aladina just sitting by the basketball courts.
               Haynie said she thought Aladina could not enter a building if
               he saw her go in. Haynie thought it was a violation of her
               protection order, which Det. Lambley notified her there were
               not protection orders in place, only a pre-trial release order.
               Det. Lambley encouraged Haynie to pursue a protection order
               through the court and told her how to do so. I confirmed there
               were no protection orders in place, and read over the pre-trial
               release order from 12/19/14. The order states that Aladina
               "shall have no contact or communication with Isabel Haynie".
               There was no violation of the order and no other crime
               occurred. Forwarded to Title IX compliance. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1001 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched to a
               report of a disorderly male in the parking lot of the Student
               Recreation Center. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 02-28-15 at approximately 1744 hours I was
               dispatched to a report of a disorderly male at the Student
               Recreation Center (SRC), located at 1105 NE North Fairway Rd.
               Dispatch advised the complainant, Devon M. Mcmenimen (DOB 11-
               01-92), was no longer on scene and was requesting phone
               contact. I called Mcmenimen on the phone and asked him what
               happened. Mcmenimen told me that on 02-28-15 at about 1645
               hours he and his roommate, Evan P. Tremblay (DOB 10-08-92),
               were getting into his vehicle in the SRC parking lot. Mcmenimen
               said once they got into his vehicle, a male came up and began
               telling them to "get out of the car". Mcmenimen said the male
               was yelling and accusing Tremblay of damaging his vehicle.
               Mcmenimen told me that he and Tremblay did not cause any damage
               to the male's vehicle and did not know what he was talking
               about. Mcmenimen said they kept asking the male to show them
               the damage, but instead the male continued to yell. Mcmenimen
               said the male was yelling, "lets go". Mcmenimen said the male
               then went to the passenger side of his vehicle, grabbed the
               side mirror, and moved it back and forth trying to break it.
               Mcmenimen said the male then went behind his vehicle and kicked
               the rear quarter panel on the passenger side. Mcmenimen said
               the male did not cause any damage to his vehicle. Mcmenimen
               said he rolled down his window, and tried to tell the male he
               would provide him with his phone number and policy number if
               there was any damage, but the male continued to yell. Mcmenimen
               said he backed up and drove off because the male was being
               hostile. Mcmenimen described the male as being Pacific
               Islander, approximately 5' 10", and about 200 lbs. Mcmenimen
               said the male was driving a black in color, 4 door sedan,
               possibly an Audi. Mcmenimen said he did not want to press any
               criminal charges and just wanted to report the incident. No
               further action at this time. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 1st day of

               28th, at approximately 2230 hours I was driving southbound on
               North Fairway near the Tennis Courts when I noticed a Kia SUV
               traveling Northbound on North Fairway. The Kia appeared to be
               traveling faster than the posted 20 MPH zone. I activated my in
               car radar (vehicle 4) and obtained a reading of 30 MPH. I
               turned around and initiated a traffic stop as the Kia pulled
               into the SRC parking lot. I contacted the driver, Kaycee D.
               Howell 01/05/95, identified myself, informed the driver I was
               recording, and explained the reason for the stop. I asked for
               Howell driver's license, proof of insurance, and vehicle
               registration. Howell stated she did not have any ID with her.
               As Howell looked for her information I could smell the strong
               odor of burnt marijuana coming from the car. I asked Howell how
               old she was and Howell stated she was 19 years old. I asked
               Howell how much marijuana was in the car. Howell said just a
               little bit. The front passenger, Nicole Huyen Nguyen 11/22/94,
               said they had smoked all of the marijuana. I asked Howell if
               she or anybody in the car had a medical marijuana card.
               Everybody said no. Howell stated they had parked off campus and
               smoked in the car. Howell stated they had smoked about an hour
               ago. I asked what they had been using to smoke. Howell said a
               pipe. I asked where the pipe was and Nguyen said they left it
               in the parking lot. I told Nguyen that it would be very odd to
               leave it in a parking lot and I did not believe her. I again
               asked Howell where the pipe was and Howell said on the floor. I
               asked to see the pipe and Howell handed me a pink makeup case.
               I opened the case and saw two glass pipes, a grinder, and a
               baby food jar with a small amount of marijuana in it. I asked
               to speak with Howell outside of the car. Once outside I asked
               Howell who the marijuana belonged to. Howell said it was
               Nguyen's. I asked Howell how many hits off the pipe she took.
               Howell said she had about four hits. I asked Howell if she was
               willing to do some voluntary standardized field sobriety tests.
               Howell stated she would. The tests were conducted on a level

               and paved sidewalk in the parking lot of the SRC. Howell was
               wearing a winter coat, shorts, and flip flops at the time of
               the tests. The sidewalk was lit by street lights, patrol car
               spot light, and personal flashlight. I explained to Howell that
               I would be evaluating her on how well she followed my
               instructions as well as how well she performed the tests. The
               first test I administered was the HGN test. I instructed Howell
               to stand with her heels and toes together and keep her arms at
               her sides. I told Howell to remain in that position while I
               administered the test. Howell stated she understood. I told
               Howell to follow the tip of my pen with her eyes only and not
               to move her head. I held my pen approximately 12-15 inches away
               from Howell's head. During the test I did not observe any signs
               of HGN The next test I administered was the walk and turn. I
               told Howell to place her left foot on an imaginary line before
               her. I then instructed Howell to place her right foot heel to
               toe in front of her left foot and keep her arms at her side.
               Howell got into the starting position as instructed. I told
               Howell to remain in that position as I gave further
               instructions. I told Howell, when I tell you to begin, don't
               begin until I tell you, you will take a series of nine heel to
               toe steps down the line, with your arms at your side, looking
               down at your feet, and counting your steps out loud. Once you
               reach your ninth step leave your lead foot planted and with
               your rear foot take a series of small steps until you are
               facing where you came from and again take nine return heel to
               toe steps. I demonstrated the test for Howell. I reminded
               Howell to keep her arms at her side, count her steps out loud,
               look down at her feet, and do not stop the test until she had
               completed it. I asked Howell if she understood and Howell said
               she did. I told Howell she could begin as soon as she was
               ready. Instruction Phase: No errors observed. First Nine Steps:
               Howell stepped off line on steps 2 and 9. When Howell reached
               her 9th step she stopped and asked about the turn. Howell
               improperly turned to the right by pivoting on the balls of her
               feet. Return Nine Steps: Howell missed heel to toe on steps, 3,
               5, and 7. The next test I administered was the One Leg Stand. I
               instructed Howell to stand with her heels and toes together and
               keep her arms at her side. I told Howell to remain in that
               position while I gave her further instructions. I told Howell,
               when I tell you to begin, don't begin until I tell you, you
               will raise either leg of your choice and raise it six inches
               off the ground. You must point your toe so the sole of your
               shoe is parallel with the ground. While pointing your toe, keep
               your arms at your side, leg straight, look down at your foot
               and count out loud, one thousand one, one thousand two, one
               thousand three, and so on until I tell you to stop. I
               demonstrated the test as I explained it. I asked Howell if she
               understood and she stated yes. I told Howell to begin whenever
               she was ready. Howell raised her right foot and began. Howell
               started counting, 1, 2, 3 and then stopped when she remembered
               how to properly count. Howell counted to 1009 before putting
               her foot down. I told Howell to continue and she raised her
               leg. When she began for the second time she used her arms for
               balance. I told Howell that the next test I had for her was the

               PBT. I explained what the PBT was, that it was voluntary, and
               it did not replace the evidentiary breath test. I found my PBT
               (Alco-Sensor FST #16805) in working condition. Howell provided
               a PBT sample of .000. I told Howell that she was under arrest
               for Minor Operating a Moving Vehicle After Consuming Marijuana
               and handcuffed (D/L) her. I advised Howell that she was being
               audio and video recorded and read Howell her Miranda Rights. I
               walked Howell over to my patrol car where she was searched
               incident to arrest. During the search I located several
               sandwich bags which contained trace amounts of marijuana. I
               placed Howell in the back seat of my patrol car. I told Howell
               that since she and her passengers had been smoking I could not
               let any of them drive. I told Howell that I could either tow
               the car or she could give me permission to park the car for
               her. Howell said she wanted me to park her car. I contacted
               Nguyen and asked her to speak to me outside of the car. Once on
               the sidewalk I asked Nguyen how many hits she took off the
               pipe. Nguyen said she took two to three hits off the pipe. I
               asked Nguyen who the marijuana belonged to and Nguyen said it
               was hers. Nguyen said everything in the pink makeup case was
               hers. I had Nguyen sit on the front bumper of my patrol car. I
               next spoke with Nikayla Emily Newberg 10/26/96 who was the
               sitting in the passenger's side rear seat. When Newberg stepped
               out of the car I noticed a half gallon of tequila on the floor
               board of the rear seat. I asked Newberg how many hits she took.
               Newberg said about four. I asked about the alcohol that was at
               her feet and Newberg said she did not know anything about it.
               Lastly I spoke with Morgan Brianne Coyle 10/05/94 who was
               sitting in the driver's side rear seat. I asked Coyle how many
               hits off the pipe she took and Coyle said two to three. I
               returned to Howell and asked about the tequila. Howell said she
               lives in a sorority and a friend of hers asked to keep it in
               her car since they are not allowed to have it in the sorority.
               I asked Howell if I could remove the alcohol from her car and
               Howell said I could. I advised Howell of her Ferrier Warnings
               and again asked if I could remove the alcohol. Howell said I
               could. I removed a half gallon of tequila and a fifth of vodka
               from the car. I again spoke with Nguyen and told her that I was
               forwarding charges of possession of marijuana less than 40 gram
               to the prosecutor. I explained the process to Nguyen. I told
               Nguyen, Newberg, and Coyle that they were free to go. The three
               walked the rest of the way home. I transported Howell to the
               Pullman Holding Facility. Once I arrived I read Howell her
               Constitutional Rights from the DUI packet. Howell signed that
               she understood her rights and did not want to exercise her
               rights at 2321 hours. Howell was placed in a holding cell while
               I applied for a Blood Search Warrant. I applied for and was
               granted a Blood Search Warrant by Judge Robinson. At 0052 hours
               I read Howell and the paramedics a copy of the search warrant
               and provided each with a copy. I watched as paramedic James
               Young swabbed the crook of Howell's left arm with 1% iodine. I
               watched as Young drew blood into the two grey top vials.
               Howell's blood was taken at 0059 hours which was two hours and
               29 minutes after Howell stopped driving. I told Howell that her
               blood would be sent to the state toxicology lab for analysis.

               charges of MOMVAC Marijuana, MIP Possession, and Possession of
               Marijuana Less than 40 grams to the prosecutor. I explained the
               process to Howell. Howell was fingerprinted, photographed, and
               released from custody. Once back at the station the seized
               items were logged into evidence. The blood was sent off to the
               state toxicology lab for analysis. My VieVu camera footage was

               Striet Hall and as soon as I got near the outside of the

               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: SYNOPSIS: Responded to report of
               malicious mischief in the fourth floor kitchen at Streit Hall.
               Someone spray painted "fuck you" on one wall of the fourth
               floor kitchen. I received a photograph of the graffiti and
               cleared the scene. No suspects no leads. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 03/01/15 at about 0015
               hours I was dispatched to a malicious mischief case in the
               fourth floor kitchen at Streit Hall. The words "fuck you" had
               been spray painted on the wall. I had responded to Striet Hall
               earlier in the evening for the same words spray painted in an
               elevator. While I was getting out of my vehicle at Streit Hall
               dispatch advised of a medical call in the lobby of Streit and
               Perham Hall. I responded to the medical call before responding
               to malicious mischief. After the medical call I talked to the
               RA who reported the graffiti, Ian D. Norgaard (031093). He said
               he found the graffiti but did not know who had done it. We went
               to the fourth floor kitchen but janitorial staff had already
               cleaned the wall. The spray paint was fresh enough it was able
               to be cleaned up, but it did smell of a strong cleaner in the
               kitchen. Another RA with Norgarrd had taken a photograph of the
               wall before it was cleaned I asked him to e-mail me the
               photograph. He showed me the photo on his phone and then e-
               mailed it to me. The graffiti was in red spray paint and said
               "fuck you". It looked very similar to the previous case (15-
               W1006). I told Norgaard to notify me if he found any other
               graffiti. No suspects, no leads. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 1st day of
               March, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               Streit Perham. He was breathing and was in and out of
               consciousness. He was not able to answer questions. I was able
               to wake him enough to start talking to me but he was not making
               a lot of sense. Pullman Fire Department arrived on scene and
               evaluated Schumacher. He was able to answer some of their
               questions. Schumacher called a friend that lived on his floor
               of Perham Hall and Pullman Fire released him to his friend.

               L./122295 Forwarding Charges MIP Exhibiting 2. NARRATIVE: On
               03/01/15 at about 0119 hours I observed a male walking on the
               south sidewalk on Cougar Way near the Physical Education
               Building. He was staggering from side to side and appeared to
               be struggling to maintain his balance. I pulled over and went
               to contact the male, later identified as Justin L Andreas
               (122295), he was crossing to the north sidewalk. I contacted
               him on the north sidewalk of Cougar Way. I asked him what was
               going on because I noticing he was struggling to walk, he did
               not answer. I asked how much he had to drink this evening and
               he said "a decent amount" and then said two beers. Andreas
               speech was very slurred and I had difficulty understanding him
               at times. I asked him how old he was and he said 19. I then
               asked if he would do some eye test for me, and he said he
               would. I began the HGN test but Andreas was swaying severely
               and not holding his head still during the test so I stopped
               administering the test. I asked Andreas if he had photo ID I
               could look at and he handed me his Cougar ID card. I asked what
               his date of birth was and he gave it to me. I had Andreas
               breath into my hand and I could smell a strong odor of
               intoxicants coming from his breath. I told Andreas I was going
               to forward charges for minor exhibiting the effects of alcohol
               while in public to the prosecutor. I then asked Andreas where
               he was going and he pointed and said over there. I asked if he
               meant Regents hall and he said no. I asked again where he lived
               and he was not able to answer me. I asked if he would take a
               PBT to see what level he was at, he said he would. He provided
               the sample to my ALCO Sensor FST (SN#102461) and it recorded a
               reading of .321. I performed the PBT in accordance with state
               toxicologist recommendations and I have been trained in using
               the ALCO Sensor FST PBT. I asked dispatch to have Pullman Fire
               Department respond to my location due to the high PBT reading.
               While PFD was en route I continued to talk to Andreas. He was
               able to tell me he lived at Coman Hall room 415. I asked if he
               knew where he was and was not able to answer. I asked what town
               he was in and he said Pullman. I asked what school he was at
               and he was unable to answer. Corporeal Edwards asked what his

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1010 SYNOPSIS: Assisted PPD with a shots
               fired call at 140 NE Whitman St. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 03-01-15 at about 0130 hours I
               heard PPD Officer Harris advise over the radio that he just
               heard shots fired in the area of 140 NE Whitman St. As PPD
               units were responding to the area, Officer Westerman and I
               responded to Campus St near Opal in the event that assistance
               was needed. As I listened to the call details over the radio, I
               heard that there was two white cars that were seen leaving the
               area of 140 NE Whitman St, one was a Dodge Charger with a
               Cougar license plate of Y118WSU. At about this time I saw two
               white cars, that appeared to be traveling together, turn right
               from Opal St onto Campus St. As they passed our location I
               could see the first car was a white Dodge Charger with a Cougar
               license plate of Y118WSU. At the time I could not tell what
               kind of car the second vehicle was, but it was following very
               close to the Charger, and obviously following. I turned around,
               got behind the vehicles, and advised Whitcom that I was behind
               the vehicles matching the description of the cars seen leaving
               the area of the shots fired call. The second car was identified
               as a white Hyundai Sonata, WA/ALX3798. At this time I heard a
               PPD Officer advise to stop and detain the occupants of the
               cars. As I planned a high risk traffic stop, both cars slowed
               and turned right into the driveway of the President's Residence
               at 755 NE Campus St. I did not activate my emergency lights.
               The Dodge Charger parked to the left of the President's Cottage
               while the second car pulled up to the open garage door of the
               President's Cottage. I turned my spotlight on and saw that
               there were several people exiting from both cars. Officer
               Westerman and I directed them all to put their hands in the
               air, which they did. I did not see specifically who got out of
               which car or their positions in the car. There were 7 people
               total, 5 females and 2 males. Both males and one female were
               instructed to sit on the south curb of the driveway and the
               other 4 females were instructed to siton the north curb of the
               driveway. By this time additional officers had arrived. Officer
               Westerman and Officer Whitman made contact with the 2 males and
               1 female on the south curb while I made contact with the other
               four females. I frisked them for weapons, finding none. They
               identified themselves as Jalea J. Crump (01-05-94), Cymone M.
               Martin (01-11-94), Da'Tay S. Norfleet-Harris (10-18-93) and
               Tatiana M. Sweat (11-09-93). I told the females that they were
               being detained and were not free to leave. I explained the

               situation to them and they stated they understood. I asked them
               who was driving the car and they said "Darren". I asked which
               one "Darren" was and they said he was the one in the gray
               sweatshirt. "Darren" was later identified as Darren K. Mitchell
               Jr (05-25-93). They then added that the guys were driving both
               cars and the females were all passengers. I did not question
               the females about what happened tonight, and waited for
               instruction from PPD on what they had and what they wanted to
               do. During this time they all became very impatient and said
               they felt like they were being held hostage. I explained to
               them again the reason we were here and it would be a bit
               longer. While I waited with the females, Officer Olmstead
               advised that there was a black, semi automatic firearm on the
               driver's side floorboard of the Hyundai. Officer Harris and
               Sgt. Hargraves arrived on scene. They were briefed on what we
               had found out and asked me to speak with the females
               individually. I spoke to Cymone M. Martin while other officers
               spoke to the other females. I asked her to step away from the
               group, which she did, and asked her to tell me what happened
               tonight. She said that they were at a party at 140 NE Whitman
               St. She said that she was sitting on the couch with Jalea when
               people started pushing and shoving. She said all of a sudden
               somebody "maced the whole party". She said they were trying to
               get out to get fresh air when there was 2 gunshots that went
               off. She said that everybody started running and jumping out of
               windows, trying to get away. She said she does not know who
               fired the shots. I asked her who the gun belongs to that was
               found on the floorboard of the car she was a passenger in. She
               said she did not know there was a gun in the car. Martin said
               she was sitting in the rear passenger side seat of the car.
               Martin was told she was free to leave. She decided to wait on
               scene for her friends. The four of them eventually got a cab
               ride home. I did not specifically talk to the others. After
               everybody had cleared the scene I contacted Chief Gardner to
               advise him of the shots fired call, which may have required a
               timely notification. I also advised him that Mitchell, who was
               identified as the driver of the second white car, admitted the

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1011 SYNOPSIS: Mitchell arrested for DUI
               and Possession of a Dangerous Weapon. Charges will be forwarded
               pending blood results from the toxicology lab. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE 1. Darren K. Mitchell 05/25/93 Charges Forwarded DUI
               Poss. Dangerous Weapon 2. NARRATIVE: On March 1, 2015 at
               approximately 0134 hours Pullman Police Department responded to
               gun shots at 140 NE Whitman St (see case number 15-P01955). I
               responded a few blocks away at the intersection of Campus and
               Opal. While sitting on the side of the road I heard dispatch
               informing Pullman PD that they had just taken a suspicious call
               (see case 15-P01957) where a group of people talking about
               getting guns. The caller stated that they had overheard the
               group say something about getting a shotgun prior to getting
               into two white cars. The caller provided the license plate of
               WA/Y118WSU. The caller stated that they saw the group near 525
               NE Kamiaken St which is one block away from 140 NE Whitman St.
               About this time two white cars turned onto Campus St from Opal.
               Both matched the description and the first car had the provided
               plate attached to the front of the car. Due to the time and
               proximity of the shots fired and the statements over heard by
               the people in the two white cars, I had reasonable suspicion
               that the occupants of the two cars were involved in the shots
               fired at 140 NE Whitman. Ofc. Edwards and I followed the cars
               about two blocks until they both turned into 757 NE Campus St.
               As both cars pulled into the driveway, Ofc. Edwards and I
               parked a ways away and turned on our spotlights. I watched as 7
               people exited from both cars. I saw a male later identified as,
               Darren Keith Mitchell 05/25/93, exit from the driver's seat of
               a 2012 Hyundai Sonata. I ordered everybody to put their hands
               up and they did so. I had four of the females sit to the right
               of the Sonata and Mitchell, a male, and another female sit on
               the curb to the left of the car. I went over to Mitchell and
               asked him if he had a gun. Mitchell said no. I frisked Mitchell
               for weapons and found none. While frisking Mitchell he smelled
               strongly of intoxicants. I remained on scene as Pullman Police
               Officers investigated. Mitchell was Mirandized during the
               interview conducted by Pullman PD. The vehicle Mitchell was
               driving had several open container of alcohol. There was a
               fifth of Crown Royal Whiskey in the center console next to the
               shifter. Ofc. Myklebust told Mitchell he believed that Mitchell
               had had quite a bit to drink and asked Mitchell if he was
               driving the Sonata. Mitchell hesitated for a moment then shook
               his head in agreement. The male sitting next to Mitchell, later

               identified as Jeremiah Matthew Allison 08/08/94, said "that's
               why I was driving in front of him to get him home." Ofc.
               Myklebust asked Allison and Mitchell if they had Allison drive
               in the front and Mitchell follow so they could get home safe.
               Allison nodded in agreement but did not say anything verbally.
               Ofc. Myklebust asked Mitchell about the bottle of Crown Royal
               Whiskey and wine bottle that were open in the car. Mitchell
               responded, "oh wait wait I promise you that shit is not mine,
               that was the girls that came with me." After Ofc. Myklebust's
               interview I asked Mitchell to talk to me away from the group.
               Mitchell slowly stood up and I had him walk towards the garage
               of the President's House. As Mitchell walked he was swaying
               side to side and appeared to be unsteady on his feet. Once away
               from the group I asked Mitchell if he was willing to do some
               voluntary field sobriety tests. Mitchell said, "Sir I'm going
               to tell you like this, I have, I'm a criminal justice major,
               but I think anything I'm going to do is going to put my uhh,
               oh, I'm cold, (unintelligible) I'm cold, but uhh, field
               sobriety tests I feel like put me in, put my justice in
               negative because I'm freezing." Mitchell was not making sense.
               It appeared that Mitchell was having difficulty formulating his
               sentence without distraction. I took Mitchell's comments as
               meaning he did not want to do field sobriety tests. As Mitchell
               spoke I could clearly smell the very strong odor of intoxicants
               coming from his breath. Mitchell's eyes were watery and
               bloodshot. Due to Mitchell's lack of coordination, strong odor
               on his breath, and his slow and deliberate manner of speech, it
               was my determination that Mitchell ability to drive was
               impaired by his alcohol consumption. I told Mitchell he was
               under arrest for DUI and handcuffed (D/L) him. I advised
               Mitchell he was being audio and video recorded and read him his
               Miranda Rights off my department issued card. Mitchell was
               searched incident to arrest and a set of brass knuckles and
               spring assisted knife combination were removed from his pocket.
               I transported Mitchell to the Pullman Police Department for
               BAC. Upon arrival I checked the Datamaster and found it working
               properly, with the RFI antenna attached, the mouth tube warm to
               the touch, and a temperature within ranges. I read Mitchell his
               Constitutional Rights at 0237 hours. Mitchell stated he
               understood his rights. When asked to sign the block that
               states, "I understand my constitutional rights. I have decided
               not to exercise these rights at this time. Any statements made
               by me are made freely, voluntarily, and without threats or
               promises of any kind" Mitchell refused to sign. I told Mitchell
               I would write the word "REFUSED" on that block. At 0237 hours I
               began to read Mitchell the Implied Consent Warning for Breath.
               Mitchell asked to go to the bathroom. I asked Mitchell if he
               would sign the Implied Consent first so I did not have to read
               it again. Mitchell said he would sign it only after going to
               the bathroom. I took Mitchell to a holding cell so he could use
               the bathroom. Once Mitchell was finished I had him come back
               and I again read Mitchell the Implied Consent Warning for
               Breath. Mitchell said he wanted to read it before signing. I
               let Mitchell read the Implied Consent twice before he signed
               it. At 0256 hours Mitchell signed the Implied Consent. It took

               him 19 minutes to make his choice. I asked Mitchell if he was
               willing to provide a breath sample and told him to check the
               yes or no box indicating his choice. After rereading the
               Implied Consent for 7 more minutes he said he did not want to
               do anything. I asked Mitchell to tell my clearly yes or no if
               he was willing to provide a sample. Mitchell said no. I told
               Mitchell he needed to take off his neckless. Mitchell struggled
               to take off his neckless looking for the clasp. Mitchell
               struggled for approximately a minute and a half before I
               pointed out that his neckless was so large he could easily lift
               it over his head. When Mitchell took of his neckless I did not
               notice any clasp. It was again obviously clear that Mitchell's
               high intoxication level was compromising his decision making
               skills. Mitchell was placed in a holding cell. I applied for
               and was granted a Blood Search Warrant for Mitchell's blood by
               Judge Robinson. I returned to the holding facility and at 0457
               hours I read Mitchell and the Medics a copy of the warrant.
               Once the warrant was read, I watched as paramedic James Young
               swabbed the crook of Mitchell's left arm with 1% iodine. I
               watched as Young drew blood into the two grey top vials.
               Mitchell's blood was taken at 0505 which was 3 hours and 25
               minutes after Mitchell stopped driving. I told Mitchell that
               pending the toxicology report of his blood, I would be sending
               charges of DUI and possession of a dangerous weapon to the
               prosecutor. I told Mitchell that he would also be referred to
               student conduct for his DUI and possession of a fire arm on
               campus. Once back at the station the blood evidence was logged
               and marked to be sent to the state toxicology lab for analysis.
               Mitchell's vehicle was impounded by Myers Towing for 12 hours.
               My VieVu camera footage was uploaded to the department's
               computer. END OF NARRATIVE I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 1st day of March,
