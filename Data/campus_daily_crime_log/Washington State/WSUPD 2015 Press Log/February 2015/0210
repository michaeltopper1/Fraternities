               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0654 SYNOPSIS: Hall Staff reported a
               subject who ripped all the items of a bulletin board twice in a
               30 minute period. Subject referred to Western WA University
               student conduct. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Parr
               R. Stover Warned/Student Conduct Mal. Misch 2. NARRATIVE: On
               02/10/15 at about 2130 hrs Dispatch advised of a RA in Duncan
               Dunn Hall who was reporting all of the items on a bulletin
               board were ripped off twice in a 30 minute time period. I
               responded and contacted the complainant, Richard A. Wallace
               (070390), who was just finishing putting all of the items back
               on a bulletin board between rooms 19 and 25 in Duncan Dunn.
               Wallace told me this was the second time he had to put all of
               the items back on the board in half an hour. Wallace said one
               of the residents saw the subject who was doing it the second
               time. I contacted Zoe D. Robinson (060796), who lives in room
               27 of Duncan Dunn. She told me she was returning to her room
               when she saw Wallace putting all of the items back on the
               bulletin board the first time. She was in her room when she
               heard someone outside pulling all of the items off the bulletin
               board again. She looked outside and saw a male, wearing
               red/purple pants with lighter colored hair, at the bulletin
               board. The male saw her and went around the corner down the
               hallway. Robinson followed and heard someone banging on the
               door in the stairwell. She opened the door and the same male
               came back in, saying he locked himself in the stairwell. The
               male then went and was talking to some people at a room just
               around the corner from the bulletin board about being locked in
               the stairwell again. Robinson said the male smelled of
               intoxicants. Wallace said he had an idea of which room Robinson
               was talking about. He directed us to room 11 and I knocked on
               the door. A female, later identified as Kaitlyn C. Lantry
               (020996), answered the door. There was another male in the
               room, later identified as Levon V. Kalustyan (100796). I asked
               Lantry if she would come out and speak with us and she asked
               what it was about. As I was speaking with Lantry I could see a
               water bong sitting on a desk in the room and a half full bottle
               of Monarch Vodka under a bed. Lantry appeared to be under 21. I
               told Lantry I was looking for a male with lighter hair wearing
               red/purple pants who was involved in damaging a bulletin board.
               I told her the male was seen talking to someone at a room in
               the area. Lantry confirmed she knew who the male was and agreed
               to call him. Initially Officer Westerman spoke to the suspect,
               who was later identified as Parr R. Stover (032496), while I

               spoke to Lantry about the marijuana/alcohol in her room. See
               case #15W0655 for further regarding that issue. Lantry
               confirmed Parr was wearing red pants and also confirmed they
               had a conversation with Parr concerning his getting locked in
               the stairwell. After speaking to Lantry about the
               marijuana/alcohol I spoke to Stover on the phone. He was
               extremely evasive and it was clear he was nervous and did not
               want to speak with me. I asked if I could meet him somewhere to
               talk and he said he was not involved with the bulletin board
               and didn't know why I wanted to talk to him. I told him I had a
               fairly good description of the suspect from the witness and if
               I could meet him that would make it easier to either confirm he
               was the one who did it or rule him out. Stover again sounded
               very nervous and said he was off campus already. I told him I
               would drive anywhere in town to meet him but he declined to
               meet with me. With the description given by Robinson and the
               confirmation of Stover's clothing and conversation from Lantry
               I believe Stover was the subject seen at the bulletin board by
               Robinson. Stover told Officer Westerman he was a Western
               Washington University Student. I will be referring the incident
               to student conduct to be sent to WWU. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 11 day of February, 2015, in Pullman,

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0655 SYNOPSIS: Subjects contacted for a
               separate incident and found to have drug paraphernalia and
               alcohol in the room. Warning issued and sent to student conduct
               only. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Kaitlyn C.
               Lantry/020996 Warned MIP/Poss. Marij. 2. NARRATIVE: On 02/10/15
               at about 2139 hrs I was in Duncan Dunn Hall investigating a
               malicious mischief that was reported by hall staff. I went to
               room 11 and knocked on the door because a suspect was seen
               speaking to someone in that room or a room across the hallway.
               I contacted the resident of the room, Kaitlyn C. Lantry
               (020996), and another male, later identified as Levon V.
               Kalustyan (100796). As I was speaking to them about the suspect
               from the malicious mischief casee (see case 15-W0654) I could
               see a water bong on a desk behind them and a half empty bottle
               of Monarch Vodka under a bed. I could smell the odor of burnt
               marijuana emitting from the room. Lantry went into the room and
               closed the door to find her phone and call the suspect from the
               malicious mischief. When she came out again the bong had been
               moved. I asked her about the bong and vodka in the room. She
               told me the bong belonged to the suspect from the Malicious
               Mischief, Parr R. Stover (032496), and the alcohol was her
               roommates. Lantry agreed to destroy both items. I walked
               outside with her and observed her pour out the vodka and
               dispose of the bong. I warned Lantry she was responsible for
               everything that occurred in her room so if she was allowing
               people to smoke in her room or consume alcohol she could be
               arrested and get in just as much trouble. Incident to be sent
               to student conduct only. Nothing further. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               11 day of February, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               Arthur (041282) on the side of Alpha Phi. She was subsequently
               trespassed by PPD. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 021015 at approximately 2153 I was looking for a
               suspect from a separate case and heading eastbound on B St near
               California St. I observed Shannon M. Arthur (041282) standing
               at the southeast corner of the Alphi Phi brick wall. She was
               kicking at the ground near a tree. I stopped and asked
               something to the effect of what was she doing? She responded
               about trash, chemicals, and needing to clean things up. I saw
               her pick up a light and put it with her belongings. She
               continued picking up trash and then sat down on the grass. I
               asked her several questions and she did not make sense. Ofc.
               Westerman was out with me. I then noticed a woman walk out of
               the Alpha Phi house who I surmised was on the phone with
               dispatch. I requested a Pullman Officer respond. I spoke with
               Mary Jo J. Cady (030245) who had called dispatch. She told me
               some of the members alerted her to Arthur banging on the side
               of their house. Cady confronted her and told her to leave the
               property and that she was trespassing. Arthur left but then
               went to the front of the house and gave Cady her newspaper.
               When I found Arthur, she was still on the property. I confirmed
               with Cady that a light should still be where I saw Arthur take
               one. I Mirandized Arthur and she cofirmed she had taken the
               light, but to give to me. I had had Arthur sit down near the
               Alpha Phi sign once I learned she may have been trespassing.
               Ofc. Burkett arrived on scene and I informed him of what I knew
               and directed him to Cady. I cleared. Nothing follows. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.

               02/10/15 at approximately 2321 hours I was driving northbound
               on Stadium Way near Cougar Way when I noticed a 2008 Chrysler
               Sebring in front of me. The tabs on the license plate displayed
               09/2014. The Sebring turned left onto Cougar Way and I
               initiated a traffic stop for the expired tabs. I contacted the
               driver, Mohammed Abdullah Al Meshaykhey 10/26/93, informed him
               I was recording, and explained the reason for the stop.
               Mohammed stated the car was his friends. I asked for Mohammed's
               driver's license. Mohammed stated he had forgotten his wallet
               at home. I asked if Mohammed had any other form of ID and he
               provided his WSU cougar card. Mohammed stated he had no other
               forms of ID. Mohammed she he drives on an international
               driver's license. I returned to my patrol car and ran Mohammed
               through dispatch. Dispatch stated there was no return for
               Mohammed. I filled out an Sector citation for RCW 46.20.005 No
               Valid Driver's License Without Valid ID. I returned to Mohammed
               and asked to speak with him on the sidewalk. Once out of the
               car I explained that he must have either his passport,
               international driver's permit, or US Government issued ID to
               drive. I explained the citation to Mohammed and provided him
               with his copy. I had Mohammed's passenger, Mohammed Hafedh Al
               Mahrouqi 07/19/93, take over driving. MY VieVu camera footage
               was not attached to the case due to a computer downloading

               at about 0027 hrs I was driving up Observatory Dr. when I
               noticed a vehicle parked in the parking lot near the
               observatory. I briefly illuminated the vehicle with my
               spotlight and saw three males sitting in the vehicle. I exited
               my vehicle and walked to the driver's door and knocked on the
               window. A male, later identified as Jake W. Klees (020596),
               opened the driver's door. I could immediately smell an
               overwhelming odor of burnt marijuana from the vehicle and could
               see the interior of the vehicle was full of smoke, which was
               now billowing out of the open driver's door. I directed all of
               the subject to step out of the vehicle and move to the front of
               the vehicle. As the rear passenger, Alec J. Scully (061995) was
               exiting the vehicle I could see him place a water bong on the
               floor of the vehicle from between his legs. The other subject
               was identified as Bijan A. Safai (050696). They all admitted to
               being under 21. I told them it was obvious what was going on
               from the smell and smoke rolling out of the vehicle. They
               admitted to smoking marijuana in the vehicle and that the
               marijuana was collectively owned by all of them. They said
               there was less than a gram of marijuana left in the vehicle. I
               had Scully retrieve the bong and remaining marijuana from the
               vehicle and place it on the roof. I asked Klees if I could
               search the vehicle to make sure there was no marijuana
               remaining in the vehicle. I told him he could decline the
               search and require I obtain a search warrant. I told him he
               could limit the scope of the search and change his mind at any
               time. Klees consented to a search of the vehicle. While
               searching the vehicle I located several plastic bags in the
               center console which had trace amounts of marijuana in them,
               there were several small buds of marijuana on the floor board,
               which appeared to have fallen from the bag retrieved previously
               by Scully. I placed the marijuana back in the bag retrieved by
               Scully from the vehicle. All of the bags and the bong, which
               had fresh marijuana in the bowl, were seized as evidence. I
               asked if any of them had medical marijuana cards and they all
               said they did not. I asked if they had been contacted or warned

               for drugs or alcohol before. Scully and Safai said they had
               been warned for marijuana in the dorms before. Klees said he
               was never warned but I later found in Spillman he was warned
               for an alcohol offense previously. I told them they were all
               under arrest for possession of marijuana. I advised them they
               were being recorded and read them their Constitutional Rights
               from a pre-printed card. I issued them each a citation for
               possession of marijuana. I explained the citations to them,
               they received their copies, and were released. Klees was
               instructed no to drive as he would be subject to arrest for DUI
               due to his marijuana consumption. They agreed to walk home.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 11 day of February, 2015, in

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0662 SYNOPSIS: Subject cited and
               released for NVOL without ID. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Sabrina A. Al Shidhani 07/09/94 Cited/Released
               NVOL without ID 5Z0236234 2. NARRATIVE: On 02/11/15 at
               approximately 0028 hours I was driving eastbound on Valley Road
               by the Willow Place Apartments when I noticed a black Chrysler
               200 heading westbound towards me. The vehicle appeared to be
               traveling well over the posted 25 MPH limit. I activated my in
               car (vehicle 4) moving radar and obtained a reading of 40 MPH.
               I turned around and caught up to the vehicle at the
               intersection of Valley Road and Stadium Way. The vehicle turned
               right on Stadium Way and I initiated a traffic stop. I
               contacted the driver, Sabrina Abdullah Al Shidhani 07/09/94,
               identified myself, informed her I was recording, and explained
               the reason for the stop. I asked Al Shidhani for her driver's
               license and Al Shidhani said she did not have it with her. Al
               Shidhani said she was just running quickly to get some food and
               left her ID at home. I asked Al Shidhani if she had any other
               form of ID and Al Shidhani provided me with her WSU cougar
               card. I asked Al Shidhani what kind of license she had and Al
               Shidhani said she had a driver's license through the Country of
               Oman. I asked Al Shidhani if she had any other forms of ID
               other than her cougar card and Al Shidhani said no. I returned
               to my patrol car and ran Al Shidhani through dispatch and there
               was no return for her. I filled out a Sector citation for RCW
               46.20.005 No Valid Driver's License without Proper ID. I
               returned to Al Shidhani and explained the citation to her. I
               provided Al Shidhani with her copy of the citation. I told Al
               Shidhani that she was not allowed to drive. Al Shidhani said
               she could call a friend to help her but it would take a while.
               I told Al Shidhani to drive the few feet into the McDonald's
               parking lot where she could call a friend to help her out. Al
               Shidhani did so and I cleared. My VieVu camera footage was not
               uploaded to the case due to a computer downloading error. END
