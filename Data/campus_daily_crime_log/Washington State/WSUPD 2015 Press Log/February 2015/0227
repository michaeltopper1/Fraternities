               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0974 SYNOPSIS: Responded to a subject
               who fell at Cooper Publication. He was transported to PRH via
               Pullman Fire Department NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               2. NARRATIVE: On 022715 at approximately 1541 hours, Pullman
               Fire Department was dispatched to a fall at Cooper
               Publications. Upon arrival, I contacted Michael McKiernan who
               was bleeding from his head. McKiernan was incoherent and not
               making sense as he spoke. Pullman Fire Medics contacted
               McKiernan and continued the investigation. I contacted others
               in the office and determined that nobody could determine what
               happened. Talking with medics, they believe that McKiernan had
               a seizure and may be suffering from a concussion. He was
               transported to PRH and I contacted his wife Meghan using his
               phone to advise her that he was on his way to PRH for an
               injury. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 27th day of February,
               2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0976 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched to the
               odor of marijuana coming from a room in Regents Hall. I

               27-15 at approximately 1718 hours, I was advised of a report of
               the odor of marijuana emitting from room #132 in Regents Hall,
               located at 1580 NE Cougar Way. I contacted the Hall Director on
               duty, Nhi P. Tran (DOB 07-16-88), who stated that she had
               smelled the odor of marijuana coming from room #132 in Regents
               Hall, at approximately 1717 hours today. I asked Tran on a
               scale of 1-10 how positive she was the odor was coming from
               room #132, with 10 being absolutely positive. Tran told me
               "10". I asked Tran on a scale of 1-10 how positive she was that
               the odor coming from room #132 was marijuana, with 10 being
               absolutely positive. Tran told me "9". I asked Tran if she ever
               attended a controlled marijuana burn class conducted by the
               police department, and she said yes. Tran said she last
               attended a controlled burn class conducted by Cpl. Daniels in
               the Fall of 2014. Tran told me she was also a Resident Advisor
               for four (4) years at the University of Texas where she
               attended multiple controlled burn classes. I asked Tran if she
               has reported other drug incidents at Washington State
               University, and what were the results. Tran told me she has
               probably called about 12 other times and in 9 of those
               incidents there have been drugs found. I asked Tran how old the
               resident of room #132 is, and she told me 19 years old. Tran
               identified the resident of the room as Sasha M. Hamirani (DOB
               07-31-95). I called Judge Robinson at approximately 1923 hours
               to apply for a search warrant for Regents Hall room #132. The
               conversation with Judge Robinson was audio recorded and has
               been included with the return of search. At approximately 1933
               hours Judge Robinson granted me the search warrant with
               permission to seize the following: Cannabis sativa, commonly
               referred to as Marijuana, a Schedule I Controlled Substance,

               but not limited to, utility company receipts, rent receipts,

               and I read her search warrant #SW022715A, and I provided her
               with a copy. I read Hamirani her Constitutional Rights from my
               department issued Miranda Warning card. I asked Hamirani if she
               understood her rights, and she nodded her head as in yes. I
               asked Hamirani if she would be willing to speak with us now,
               and she said "I have no problem to speak with you". I asked
               Hamirani if there was any marijuana in the room, and she said
               "yes there is". I asked Hamirani if she could tell us where the
               marijuana is located in her room, and she said "it's in my
               backpack". I asked Hamirani if there were any other areas in
               her room with marijuana, and she said "there is some in my
               desk". I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the

               domestic in progress. Unable to locate. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 02-27-15 at about 2115 hours
               WSU units were toned out to a physical domestic dispute in
               progress. Whitcom advised that there was a male and female
               inside a dark brown car that were arguing and it looked like
               the male was holding the female by her head. The car was in
               front of Northside Residence Hall. Officers Tiengo, Petlovany,
               Boyd and I all responded. I arrived first and contacted a male
               standing in front of Northside. He was identified as Brandon M
               R Destito. I asked if he had been in an argument. He said no,
               but he saw 2 people who were. He said that there was a male and
               female in a small black car that were fighting. He told me that
               he saw the car pull over, heard arguing, the female got out and
               it looked like the male hit her 4 times on the head. Destito
               said the female then walked away between the Fieldhouse and
               Bohler Gym and said she was wearing a pink vest. I asked Tiengo
               to go on foot and look for her. He said the male drove away. He
               told me that a few minutes had already passed between the time
               this happened and the time we got there. I asked Destito if he
               was the caller and he said no, he did not want to get involved.
               He said it did not look like the female was hurt and told me he
               would have stepped in if he saw her getting hurt. He did not
               have any better description of the car other than a small black
               passenger car. Officers remained mobile in the area for about
               15 minutes. Tiengo searched around Martin Stadium and the CUB
               for the female. Neither party was located. Unknown who was
               involved or if they were injured. Unable to locate. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.

               stopped on Grimes Way at Stadium Way for a red light. I noticed
               two males in the Fine Arts parking structure which was directly

               near the vehicle ramp and it appeared they were skateboarding.
               I entered the parking garage and waited at the bottom of the

               NARRATIVE: On 022715 at approximately 2321 hours I encountered
               a vehicle (ID/2CKU608) just north of the Steffen Center on
               Terre View Dr that had a flat tire. They were in the process of
               changing the tire. I contacted the driver, Yadira Zuniga

               blocking a fire lane/emergency access at the turn around in

               Parking in Fire Zone 148220 2. NARRATIVE: On 02/28/15 at 0016
               hrs I was driving to the turn around at Regents Hall when I
               found a vehicle, WA AOV0913, that was parked against the red
               fire lane curb on the island in the middle of the turn around.
               Not only was the vehicle parked in the fire lane but it was
               blocking the driveway leaving only enough room for a small car.
               In the event of an emergency an ambulance or fire truck would
               not have been able to get through the area. As I was completing
               a parking infraction for the vehicle a female, Jessica D. Holly
               (101696), came out and advised it was her friends car that she
               was borrowing. I issued her the ticket (148220) and counseled
               her on parking in marked spaces and not blocking emergency
               access. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 28 day of February,

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0985 SYNOPSIS: Joseph S. Degroot (DOB
               07-18-92) was cited and released for DUI. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Joseph S. Degroot / (07-18-92) Cited
               and Released DUI 9052 2. NARRATIVE: On 02-28-15 at
               approximately 0024 hours Officer Boyd requested that I respond
               to assist him with a traffic stop at the Presbyterian Church
               parking lot, located at 1630 NE Stadium Way. I arrived on scene
               and contacted Ofc. Boyd. Ofc. Boyd advised that he had observed
               a blue, 2014 Subaru Outback (WA Lic. APK4684) traveling on
               Stadium Way. Ofc. Boyd stated he had observed the vehicle
               traveling 40 MPH in a 20 MPH zone. Ofc. Boyd advised he had
               stopped the vehicle and contacted the driver, who was
               identified as Joseph S. Degroot (DOB 07-18-92). Ofc. Boyd also
               told me he could smell the odor of intoxicants coming from the
               vehicle. Ofc. Boyd remained on scene as a backup officer, while
               I took over the investigation. For more information see Ofc.
               Boyd's supplemental narrative. I activated my Vievu camera, and
               I contacted Degroot in his vehicle and asked him if he would
               mind taking some voluntary field sobriety tests. Degroot told
               me he would take them. I asked Degroot to step out of the
               vehicle. Degroot exited the vehicle and removed the jacket he
               was wearing. I asked Degroot if he was sure he did not want his
               jacket because it was cold outside. Degroot told me he would be
               fine. I told Degroot he was being audio and video recorded. I
               explained to Degroot I would be evaluating him on how well he
               performed the tests as well as how well he followed my
               instructions. Degroot told me he understood. I administered the
               field sobriety tests in the level and paved parking lot at the
               front of the Presbyterian Church. The weather was clear and
               cold. Degroot was wearing a t-shirt, jeans, and dress boots
               during the test. Lighting was provided by the nearby light post
               and my flashlight. The first test I administered was the HGN. I
               told Degroot to stand with his feet together and his arms at
               his sides. I told Degroot to follow the tip of my pen with his
               eyes only. I told Degroot to keep his head still. I held my pen
               approximately 12-15 inches in front of Degroot's face and
               administered the test. I checked Degroot's eyes and noticed
               they tracked equally and his pupils were equal in size. I did
               not see resting nystagmus in either eye. I saw a lack of smooth
               pursuit and a distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum
               deviation in both eyes. I did not see any onset of nystagmus
               prior to 45 degrees in either eye. I did not see any vertical
               nystagmus in either eye. The next test I administered was the

               walk and turn. I started to explain the test, but moved Degroot
               to an area in the parking lot with a more level and less sloped
               surface. I told Degroot to find an imaginary straight line and
               put his left foot on the line. I told Degroot to put his right
               foot in front of his left foot, with the heel of his right foot
               touching the toes of his left foot. In order to get Degroot
               walking in the direction I wanted him, I pointed to a blue
               straight line painted on the ground and told him to use that
               line. I told Degroot to stay in that position while I explained
               the test. Right after Degroot got into the starting position he
               lost his balance and stepped off to the left. I told Degroot to
               take nine heel to toe steps down the line and to take nine heel
               to toe steps back. I demonstrated three heel to toe steps for
               Degroot. I told Degroot when he gets to his last step to keep
               his lead foot planted on the ground, and take a series of small
               steps with his other foot. I demonstrated the turn and three
               more heel to toe steps for Degroot. Degroot then began to start
               walking before I told him to begin. I told Degroot to get back
               into the starting position. I told Degroot to watch his feet as
               he walked, count his steps out loud, keep his arms at his
               sides, and not to stop walking until he completes the test.
               While I explained those instructions, Degroot failed to get
               back into the starting position and was more at a position of
               attention, with his arms by his side. I had to remind Degroot
               another time to get back into the starting position. I asked
               Degroot if he wanted me to repeat any of the instructions
               again, and he told me "I don't believe you need to". I told
               Degroot to begin the test. Instruction Phase: Degroot swayed
               right to left and lost his balance in the starting position by
               stepping off to the left. Degroot started to walk before I told
               him to do so. First Nine Steps: Degroot began the test and was
               not counting out loud so I had to remind him. Degroot stepped
               off the line to the right on step 5. Degroot missed heel to toe
               between steps 4 & 5. Degroot stopped walking at steps 5 and 9.
               Once Degroot got to step 9 he stopped and started to raise his
               right arm to regain his balance. Degroot asked "do you want me
               to about face at 9?". I told Degroot to turn like I asked him.
               Turn: Degroot turned around to the right, instead of to the
               left like I showed him. Degroot also just spun around instead
               of taking a series of small steps like I had demonstrated to
               him. Second Nine Steps: Degroot began his return steps and
               stepped off the line to the right on step 5. Degroot missed
               heel to toe between steps 2 & 3 and 3 & 4. The next test I
               administered was the one leg stand. I told Degroot to stand
               with his feet together and his arms at his sides. I told
               Degroot to maintain this position until I told him to do
               otherwise, and he said he understood. I told Degroot when I
               tell him to begin, to raise either leg of his choice
               approximately 6 inches off the ground. I told him to keep his
               foot parallel to the ground. I told Degroot to count out loud
               by 1000's until I tell him to stop. I told Degroot to keep both
               legs straight, look at his legs, keep his arms by his side, and
               I reminded him to not stop counting until I tell him to stop.
               Degroot began the test before I instructed him to do so. Once
               Degroot was back in the starting position he told me was going

               to raise his left leg. I told Degroot he may begin the test.
               Once Degroot began I had to remind him to count out loud. Once
               Degroot started counting out loud he counted 1,2,3 etc.,
               instead of 1000's like I instructed him. Degroot put his left
               leg down on count 8. I told Degroot to pick up his leg and
               continue on where he left off. When he got to 11, he began
               counting 11 one thousand etc. I looked at my watch and noticed
               thirty seconds had elapsed on Degroot's count of 8. I asked
               Degroot if he would submit to a voluntary preliminary breath
               test (PBT). I told Degroot the PBT does not replace the
               evidentiary breath test, and is inadmissible in court. Degroot
               said he would take the test. I checked the PBT (Alco Sensor FST
               #102460) and found it working properly. Degroot had not
               consumed anything (including alcohol) in the past 10 minutes
               and had not smoked in the past three minutes. Degroot provided
               a breath sample of .150 at 0039 hours. At this time it was my
               opinion that Degroot's ability to drive was impaired by
               alcohol. I handcuffed Degroot (double locked) and searched him
               incident to arrest, finding no items of evidentiary value or
               weapons. I reminded Degroot he was still being audio and video
               recorded. I placed Degroot into the back of my patrol vehicle
               and read him his Constitutional Rights from my department
               issued Miranda Warning card. I asked Degroot if he understood
               his rights, and he nodded his head up and down indicating yes.
               I asked Degroot, having these rights in mind, did he wish to
               speak with me now. Degroot shook his head side to side
               indicating he did not wish to speak with me. Ofc. Olmstead and
               I transported Degroot to Pullman PD for the BAC. Ofc. Boyd
               contacted the two passengers in Degroot's vehicle and
               facilitated the tow/impound with Myers Autobody. Upon arrival
               to Pullman PD, I checked the Datamaster and found it in proper
               working order, with the RFI antenna attached, the mouth tube
               was warm to the touch, and a temperature display within
               acceptable ranges. I checked Degroot's mouth at 0118 hours,
               finding no foreign substance. I read Degroot his Constitutional
               Rights at 0122 hours. Degroot said he understood his rights and
               signed both signature blocks. Degroot then stated he did not
               want to answer any questions and requested to speak with an
               attorney. At about 0127 hours I provided Degroot with his cell
               phone and directed him to the interview room. I showed Degroot
               the numbers of the attorneys posted on the wall in the room and
               explained to him the ones he could call. Degroot was left
               inside of the room, and I could observe him speaking to someone
               on his cell phone through the window in the door. Degroot
               exited the interview room at about 0138 hours. Degroot stated
               that he had contacted an attorney, John Hart. I did another
               mouth check at 0138 hours, finding no foreign substance. I read
               Degroot his Implied Consent Warning for Breath at 0145 hours.
               Degroot signed that it was read to him. I asked Degroot if he
               would submit to a breath test, and he said yes. Degroot
               provided a breath sample of .144 at 0204 hours and a sample of
               .144 at 0207 hours. The breath test was administered in
               accordance to the methods approved by the Washington State
               Toxicologist pursuant to the Washington Administrative Code.
               Degroot was fingerprinted and photographed. I issued Degroot

               criminal citation #9052 for DUI. Ofc. Olmstead and I provided
               Degroot with a copy of the driver's hearing request, notice of
               hearing/conditions of release, tow/impound form, and the
               citation. Ofc. Olmstead and I explained all the forms to
               Degroot, and returned all of his property to him. Degroot was
               released from custody. I later downloaded the video footage
               from my Vievu camera to the permanent digital evidence folder.
               I later emailed the DUI report to the Washington Department of
               Licensing. No further action at this time. I certify and

               approximately 0040 hours I was walking westbound on NE Linden
               St near Community Duncan Dunn Hall when I observed Emily K.
               Romasko (122095) walking towards me. She staggered several
               times, appeared to be under 21, and when she walked by me I
               smelled the odor of intoxicants at which time I had her stop
               and speak with me. Her two friends, Daniella B. Greenwood
               (102095) and Madison T. Hanson (022696), also stopped. All
               three admitted to drinking and being under 21. I observed a
               lack of smooth pursuit in each of their eyes. I observed
               distinct and sustained nystagmus in Romasko's eyes. I detected
               the odor of intoxicants on each of their breaths. Greenwood
               swayed while she stood and they all had watery eyes. Greenwood
               provided a breath sample of .152, Romasko a sample of .225, and
               Hanson a sample of .158. They were all cooperative and polite.
               Romasko was aware, oriented, and would be staying with her
               friends. They were free to go with a warning and I cleared. I

               Booked Assault 4th DV 2. NARRATIVE: On 022815 at approximately
               0116 hours we were dispatched to a 911 call from a cell phone
               locating to the area of NE N Fairway Ln and Ne Fairway. Ofc.
               Boyd, Ofc. Whitman, Cpl. Edwards, and I responded. I arrived
               last and Ofc. Boyd directed me towards a female, Maritza V.
               Dominguez (092494) walking southbound on NE N Fairway Ln,
               approaching Ferdinand's Ln. I contacted her and asked if
               everything was okay and she said something to the effect of
               "that guy over there is drunk and he put his hands on me". She
               was crying as she said this with a shaking voice. She also held
               out her arms and looked at them. Dominguez had pointed towards
               Vidales when she said this. She was not keen on speaking with
               me but informed me that Vidales was her boyfriend of 5 years
               and that they lived together. She stated that they had been in
               her car and Vidales was jealous about something. He left the
               car and she thought he had her keys she followed him to get
               them back. She stated he "grabbed" her arms and indicated it
               was above her elbows on both arms. She stated he pushed her "a
               good amount of times" and I clarified with her that she thought
               he had pushed her 4-5 times. She stated he had slapped her
               hands. Vidales would grab her and then push her. I was not able
               to see marks but had Cpl. Edwards take photos of her arms.
               Dominguez stated she had not been drinking. Via radio, Ofc.
               Boyd informed me that Vidales was refusing to talk or identify
               himself. I informed him that we had enough information for an
               Assault 4th DV arrest. Dominguez gave us Vidales' information
               and his wallet which contained his WADL. Dominguez was provided
               with a Domestic Violence card and I asked her if she wanted us
               to call ATVP or WSU Counseling. She declined but took the card.
               Ofc. Boyd took Vidales to PPD, I returned to the station, and
               Cpl. Edwards took Dominguez to her car. I later assisted in
               making entry into the car as it was thought Vidales had locked
               the keys in the car. After making entry the keys were not
               found. I returned to the station to complete the PC booking
               form and later Graveyard transported Vidales to Whitman County
               Jail. Nothing follows. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 28th day of February,

               hours I was on patrol on Campus St near Community Hall when I
               observed a male walking eastbound on Campus St. The male caught
               my attention because he was stumbling from side to side as he
               walked, using almost the entire width of the sidewalk. I also
               recognized the male as somebody I had seen about 30-45 minutes
               prior, who I had seen on Thatuna St. At that time I saw the
               same male stumbling but he went to the door of Wilmer Hall and
               I thought he was going to go inside, so I did not contact him.
               I stopped my patrol car and asked the male to stop so I could
               talk to him, he turned around and stopped. When he turned
               around I could immediately see that he had blood on his face
               and a black eye. I could also see his right hand, which was
               partially in his pant pocket, appeared very swollen and had
               dried blood on it. I asked if he was ok and he said he was. I
               could smell a very strong odor of alcohol on his breath as he
               spoke, he had glassy eyes and swayed back and forth as he stood
               there. I asked him if he needed medical attention and he said
               no. I asked what happened and he would not tell me. He tried to
               tell me a story about his fraternity brothers and how they hold
               each other accountable. I asked if he was in a fight and he
               said no, he was just trying to get to his girlfriends room,
               which was in Wilmer Hall. I asked if he punched a wall and he
               said no. I asked how his hand got to be so swollen and how he
               got a black eye. He would not give me a straight answer. I
               asked the male if he had ID and he said yes. When he went to
               get it he told me that it was actually in his backpack. He
               provided his name and DOB of Scott J. Mulder/01-22-94. I asked
               Mulder where he was trying to go and he said Whitman St. He
               also told me through our conversation that he was trying to go
               to his girlfriends. At about this time a female came out of
               Wilmer Hall and identified herself as Mulder's girlfriend. I
               asked her to stand aside, which she did. I continued to speak
               to Mulder to try and determine how he got a black eye and
               swollen hand. He tried to tell me several stories, none of
               which made any sense. I asked Mulder to sit down while I talked
               ot his girlfriend. I then spoke to Kelsey M. Knight. She said
               that Mulder was her boyfriend and apologized for the problem.
               She said that she was with her friends and did not answer
               Mulder's call so that's why he was probably wandering around
               outside. She said that it was ok if he came inside to her room

               and that she would take care of him. I returned to where Mulder
               was sitting. I told him he was free to go and that he could go
               with his girlfriend if he wanted. He started to cry and said he
               needed a minute. I asked what was wrong. Through our previous
               conversation I gathered that Mulder may have an a drinking
               probleml. I asked Mulder if he thought he had a problem with
               alcohol. He told me he wasn't ready to admit that and continued
               to cry. I asked him if he has ever talked to a counselor and he
               said no, he doesn't need counseling. He asked if I could talk
               to him. I told him I thought it best he talk with a
               professional counselor. He said he didn't want to and insisted
               he talk to me, but not right now. I gave Mulder my business
               card and told him that I work at 9pm tomorrow night if he felt
               like he wanted to talk. He took my business card then got up
               and walked inside with Knight. After I returned to the station
               I saw that Mulder had been contacted by Pullman Police at about
               0200 hours for trespassing in AGD's, his girlfriend's sorority.
               He was removed at that time and his friends said they were
               going to take him home. I sent an email reference this case to
               WSU counseling services and attached the email to Spillman
               Files. Request for the complete case be sent to counseling
               services and student conduct. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               28th day of February, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.
