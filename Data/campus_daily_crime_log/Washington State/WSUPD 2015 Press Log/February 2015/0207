               blocking Smith Gym parking lot entrance and part of Cougar Way,
               no emergency. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 02-07-15 at approximately 0904 hours Officer
               Kirshner and I were dispatched to a disabled vehicle in front
               of the green lot by the gyms on Cougar Way. Ofc. Kirshner and I
               arrived on scene and I saw a black 2 door Hyundai Tuscani with
               WA license plate AHG6148, blocking the green parking lot
               entrance of Smith Gym and hanging out a little bit into the
               east bound lane on Cougar Way. I noticed the emergency brake
               was not set on the vehicle. I took photographs of the vehicle.
               As I was about to make phone calls to contact the registered
               owner, the driver and registered owener Robert G. Chisholm (09-
               21-60) showed up. Chisholm was surprised to see where his
               vehicle was because he said he originally parked in the green
               lot. I told Chisholm to make sure his vehicle is in park next
               time. Ofc. Kirshner and I cleared the scene. No further
               investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury

               entry was not necessary at this time. I informed them when they
               find a key, and want to check the building, they can call us to

               hours WSU officers were toned out to a burglary alarm at Avery
               Hall room 103. Sgt. Macy, Ofc. Kirshner and I responded. We
               made entry into the building and I went to room 103 and saw the
               door was open, I yelled "Police" and entered the room. As I
               entered the room I could see the light on in the adjoining
               room, 102. Sgt. Macy told me he saw a person in room 102. The
               person in room 102 walked over to room 103 where I was and she
               identified herself as Elizabeth A. Francese (09-28-90).
               Francese told me she works there she just entered the door code
               incorrectly. Francese told us she just was there to print off a
               few papers. I told Francese if she accidentally sets off
               another alarm in the future to please call our dispatch center
               to notify them and to wait outside the building to notify any
               law enforcement that responds. Francese was able to enter the
               correct door code when we were there and reset the alarm before
               exiting. Francese apologized and said she would call next time
               if it ever happens, but does not have our number. I gave her
               one of my business cards with the non-emergency contact number.

               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0601 02-07-15 SYNOPSIS: Man trying to
               run out in front of traffic on N. Fairway Rd. and the SRC.
               Taken to Pullman Regional Hospital for Involuntary Treatment
               Act. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               02-07-15 at approximately 1129 hours Ofc. Kirshner and I were
               on patrol on N. Fairway Rd. and as we were passing the Student
               Recreational Center two males were standing on the side of the
               road. One of the males was on his cell phone and flagged us
               down by waving, later identified as Jason L. Kortness (11-26-
               88). I stopped my patrol car next to Kortness and the other
               male to see what they needed. Kortness told us the other male,
               later identified as Michael R. Barce (12-20-79) was trying to
               run out into traffic. Kortness had just called dispatch as he
               was flagging us down. Ofc. Kirshner told them to wait there
               well we moved our patrol vehicle out of the roadway. Ofc.
               Kirshner and I walked over to where Kortness and Barce were
               standing and I had both of them move away from the roadway
               before gathering any more information. As soon as we moved to a
               safer location I asked Kortness what happened. Kortness told me
               he works for Aacres, LLC in Spokane, WA and he is supposed to
               be looking after Barce. Kortness told me he was with Barce for
               the Special Olympics Basketball Tournament being held in Bohler
               Gym, but Barce did not like being up in the stands and began to
               get upset because he is afraid of heights and decided to leave.
               Kortness said Barce then began to try to walk out in front
               traffic and that is why he was flagging us down. I asked Barce
               why he was trying to run out in traffic and he said he wanted
               to get hit by a car. I told Barce that would probably hurt
               really bad if he were to get hit by a car and Barce said he
               knew. I asked Barce if he wanted to hurt himself and he said
               yeah. I asked Barce how often he thinks about hurting himself
               and he said all the time. I asked Barce if he takes any
               medications and he said he does. I asked him if he took his
               meds today and he said he did. I asked Barce if he wanted to
               kill himself and Barce said he wants to kill himself. I asked
               Barce if he had any family nearby who could pick him up and he
               said he has no local family. Kortness called the Director of
               Aacres, LLC and I spoke with Joseph H. Ryd (07-25-75). Ryd told
               me they have issues like this all the time with Barce where he
               tries to run out in traffic. I asked Ryd if he or anyone else
               could come pick up Barce and be his caregiver. Ryd told me he
               would have to come from Spokane and that would not work. Ryd
               also told me Kortness and Barce would be taking the bus back to

               Spokane and Ryd was afraid Barce may flip out on the bus ride
               back. Ryd said he thought the best option for Barce would be
               the hospital. I told Barce we are there to help him and that
               Ofc. Kirshner and I were going to take him to the hospital to
               get him the help he needed. I told Barce I was going to place
               handcuffs on him and search him before being transported, but
               that he was not under arrest. I again just told Barce we were
               just taking him into protective custody. After I handcuffed and
               searched Barce I placed him in the back of our patrol car.
               Kortness rode in the back of the patrol car with Barce. Ofc.
               Kirshner and I transported Barce to the Pullman Regional
               Hospital. Upon arrival at the hospital Barce was left in the
               care of the emergency care staff at the Pullman Regional
               Hospital. I filled out the protective custody form and made a
               photocopy to take with me and I left the original at the
               hospital. The protective custody form has been attached. No
               further investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 7th day of February,

               will be forwarded to the prosecutor. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               PBT SAMPLE 1. Makenzie R. Taber 09/14/95 Charges Forwarded MIP
               Exhibiting .205 2. NARRATIVE: On 02/07/15 at approximately 2222
               hours I was driving northbound on Thatuna Street. As I neared
               Linden St I looked down the street and saw two females standing
               near an entrance door to Davis Hall. I came to a stop in the
               roadway and watched the two. One female in particular, later
               identified as Makenzie Ray Taber 09/14/95, grabbed my
               attention. Taber had her left arm over the shoulder of another
               female, not identified, in an attempt to steady herself while
               walking. Taber even though assisted was still stumbling
               forwards and backwards as she walked. The two stopped walking
               and Taber was still swaying backwards and forwards. At this
               point I was not able to see their faces. I pulled around the
               block and as I reached Linden St I found the two near the
               entrance of Community Duncan Dunn. Taber was on the ground
               sitting and the other female was standing next to her. Based on
               my prior observations of Taber I had believed at the time that
               she had fallen down. I pulled up next to Taber and asked if she
               was ok. Taber said she was fine but I decided to check on her
               welfare since it appeared she had fallen down. At no point were
               my emergency lights activated. I exited my patrol car and
               walked up to Taber who was still sitting on the sidewalk. I
               noticed Taber appeared to be under the age of 21. I asked Taber
               if she fell down and Taber stated she was just trying to get
               her shoe back on. Taber was wearing canvas styled low top
               shoes. Taber stood up and her motions were wobbly as she did
               so. Taber stood next to the other female and I explained what I
               had observed. Taber began to explain that the back of her shoes
               "don't come on" and explained that when she goes to class they
               "don't come on." I understood what Taber was trying to say but
               found it odd the way she was trying to describe it. I asked
               Taber if she had her ID with her and Taber said no. I asked
               Taber for her name and date of birth which Taber provided
               verbally. Taber identified herself as 19 years old. I asked
               Taber how much she had to drink tonight and Taber said she had
               a little bit. I asked how much that was for her and Taber said,
               "a little bit, I'm not like super drunk or anything." I asked
               Taber if I could look at her eyes and Taber said I could. I
               told Taber to stand with her heels and toes together and to
               follow the tip of my pen with her eyes only, keeping her head
               still. As soon as I moved my pen Taber moved her head to

               follow. I reminded Taber to keep her head still but throughout
               the test Taber was moving her head, making it difficult to
               observe all the signs of HGN. During the test I observed equal
               pupil size, equal tracking, lack of smooth pursuit, and
               distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation in both
               eyes. During the test Taber was swaying side to side and at one
               point swayed so much that she lost her balance and stumbled to
               her left. As Taber stood before me I could clearly smell the
               odor of intoxicants coming from her breath. I told Taber that I
               believed that she had more to drink than just a little bit. I
               asked Taber if she was willing to be a little more honest with
               me and Taber said she had one mixed drink with two shots. I
               told Taber that I did not believe her and Taber then said she
               had two mixed drinks. I asked Taber if she was willing to take
               a PBT test that was voluntary. Taber said, "I guess so." I
               found my PBT (Alco-Sensor FST #16805) in working condition.
               Taber attempted to provide a sample but was barely blowing
               through the breath tube. I manually clicked the PBT after one
               second of the three second sample. Taber provided a weak PBT
               sample of .205. I told Taber that she was under arrest for MIP
               and handcuffed (D/L) her. I told Taber that she was being audio
               and video recorded. I read Taber her Miranda Rights off my
               department issued card. Taber stated she understood her rights
               and having her rights in mind wished to still speak with me. I
               had Taber sit in the backseat of my patrol car. I researched
               Taber's name and found she had no prior contacts for alcohol or
               drugs by local Law Enforcement. I told Taber that she was too
               intoxicated to be out walking around and offered to drive her
               to her dorm. Taber said that was fine. I also transported
               Taber's friend at the same time back to Goldsworthy Hall. Once
               at Goldsworthy Hall, I told Taber that I would be forwarding
               charges of MIP Exhibiting to the prosecutor. I explained the
               process and released Taber from custody. Taber and her friend
               walked into Goldsworthy Hall and I cleared. END OF REPORT I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 9th day of February, 2015, in Pullman,

               smell andything but a candle. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 02-07-15 at about 2226 hours I
               was dispatched to the report of drugs at Stephenson North room
               1325. The RP, Britteny L. Alspach, advised that she could smell
               the odor of marijuana emitting from room 1325. She said she
               would be in the 13th floor lobby for contact. I arrived on
               scene and contacted Alspach near the elevator. She told me that
               when she checked the room she could barely smell the odor of
               marijuana. She said she mostly smelled candles. I walked
               towards the room and could not detect the odor of marijuana. I
               arrived at room 1325 and put my nose to the crack of the door.
               All I could smell was what I thought to be candles. I knocked
               on the door several times and there was no answer. I did not
               hear any movement inside the room. I also put my nose to the
               crack of the door as I knocked and all I could smell was fresh
               air coming out of the room. Alspach told me she was sure
               somebody was in there because there was a towel rolled up along
               the bottom of the door. She then slid her Cougar Card under the
               door to show me that it was hitting something that had been
               placed in front of the door. I told Alspach that I did not
               smell anything and I could not force somebody to open the door
               for me if they were indeed inside the room. She seemed
               frusterated with me. I told her there was nothing else I could
               do and to call again if she had any other issues. No odor
               detected, no resident information obtained. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0607 SYNOPSIS: Subject contacted and
               warned for smoking marijuana on the westside of the Stephenson
               Complex. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE 1. Raymond E. Baldonado
               01/17/96 Student Conduct Poss. of Marijuana 2. NARRATIVE: On
               02/07/15 at approximately 2243 hours I heard Sgt. Griffin call
               out on foot in the area of the Stephenson Complex to
               investigate the odor of burnt marijuana. Sgt. Griffin was
               walking around the southside of Stephenson Complex. I responded
               to Stephenson North loading dock area and parked. As I was
               exiting my patrol car I noticed a male walking along the
               northside of the Stephenson Complex. Due to the time and
               proximity to the odor of marijuana I believed the male to be
               involved. I called out to the male, later identified as Raymond
               Emilio Baldonado, and asked if I could talk to him for a
               second. Baldonado walked over to me. As soon as Baldonado
               reached me I could smell the strong odor of burnt marijuana
               coming from his clothing. I had not smelled the odor of
               marijuana prior to this point. I asked Baldonado if he had his
               ID and he provided me with his WADL. I asked Baldonado to keep
               his hands out of his pockets. Due to being with Baldonado by
               myself in a remote area I told Baldonado that I would be
               frisking him for weapons. During the frisk I felt no weapons. I
               told Baldonado that Officers were in the area to investigate
               who had been smoking marijuana. I told Baldonado since he was
               found in the immediate area of where the odor had been coming
               from and since he was the only person outside I had come in
               contact with, I believed that it was him who had been smoking.
               I asked Baldonado if he had a medical marijuana card and he
               said no. I asked Baldonado how much he had smoked today.
               Baldonado stated he had smoked a couple of bowls. Baldonado
               also stated he had been smoking about 45 minutes prior. I asked
               Baldonado why he was walking from behind the building.
               Baldonado started to think of a lie and I told him I knew the
               deal. Baldonado said, "yeah" in an affirmation that he was
               responsible for the burnt marijuana odor. I asked Baldonado if
               he had any marijuana left and he said no. Baldonado stated he
               had been smoking a blunt. I asked Baldonado if I could search
               him and he said I could. I searched Baldonado and found no
               illegal items on him. Baldonado did have a lighter and more
               Swisher Sweets cigarillos. About this time Sgt. Griffin and
               Cpl. Edwards arrived on scene. I thanked Baldonado for his
               cooperation and told him that it is not illegal to be under the
               influence of marijuana and under age only to possess it under

               conduct for violating the University's policies however.
               Baldonado stated he understood. I told Baldonado that he was
               free to go and he left. All units cleared shortly thereafter.

               Patient 2. Travis T. Clarke/04-28-96 Student Conduct Witness
               NARRATIVE: On 02-07-15 at about 2259 hours I heard Pullman
               medics being dispatched to Northside Residence Hall for the
               report of a fall. I responded to the area and was told there
               was a subject in the 5th floor men's restroom who had fallen. I
               arrived on scene and contacted Joshua P. W. Johanson, Travis T.
               Clarke and several RA's in the 5th floor men's restroom. I
               could see Johanson was bleeding from an injury he had sustained
               on his forehead. I asked Johanson to sit down, which he did. I
               asked him what happened and he said he hit his head on his dorm
               room door. I asked him how that happened and he was not exactly
               sure. Johanson's speech was slurred as he spoke. I could smell
               a very strong odor of intoxicants in the restroom. I could also
               see that Johanson and Clarke had bloodshot watery eyes. I asked
               Johanson how much he had to drink and he said "a lot". He told
               me that they had been drinking out of a 1/2 gallon bottle of
               Admiral Nelson Spiced Rum. He said that he was drinking
               straight out of the bottle and was unsure of the exact amount
               he consumed. I asked Clarke how much he had to drink and he
               said "not too much" and would not specify. Once the medics
               arrived they evaluated Johanson and he decided that he wanted
               to go to the hospital. While the medics were trying to move
               Johanson from the bathroom to the gurney, Clarke was standing
               in the way. I asked him to move and he stood against the wall
               with his arms crossed and said he was fine where he was. I had
               already turned my vievu camera off because I was on my way out.
               At this time I turned my camera back on and walked towards
               Clarke who was refusing to get out of the way. I escorted
               Clarke across and down the hallway and told him not to make
               this a bigger issue than it needs to be. He then agreed to stay
               out of the way. Clarke wanted to ride in the ambulance with
               Johanson but the medics would not let him due to his alcohol
               consumption. I told Clarke to go to his room and also advised
               him that if he went outside he could be arrested for MIP
               Exhibiting. Johanson was transported to PRH via ambulance.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing

               Public Servant NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               Alexander M. Stephens 02/18/94 Arrested MIP Exhibiting
               5Z0236227 False Statements 2. NARRATIVE: On 02/07/15 at
               approximately 2304 hours I was driving eastbound on Cougar Way
               near Smith Gym responding to back Ofc. Edwards who was at a
               call at Northside Hall. When I reached the area of Smith Gym I
               noticed a male walking westbound on Cougar Way. The male, later
               identified as Alexander Michael Stephens 02/18/94, appeared to
               be highly intoxicated. As Stephens walked he was stumbling side
               to side taking up almost the whole width of the sidewalk.
               Stephens was hunched over with his head down as he walked as if
               he was in a daze of sorts. When I drove closer to Stephens, I
               could see his face and he appeared to be under the age of 21. I
               passed Stephens and turned around. I pulled into the Smith Gym
               parking lot and contacted Stephens. As Stephens was walking he
               was holding his wrist as if it was hurt. As Stephens neared my
               I asked him if he was ok. Stephens said he was fine he was just
               walking back to his apartment. I asked Stephens if he had hurt
               his wrist and Stephens stated he had hit his arm on some
               barrier as he walked passed it. Stephens' words were slurred as
               he spoke. I explained what I had observed to Stephens and asked
               how old he was. Stephens said he was 21 years old. I asked
               Stephens if he had his ID with him and Stephens replied, "yeah
               I do, shit no I don't." I asked Stephens what his last name was
               and Stephens said it was Stephens spelled, "S T E V E N S." I
               asked for Stephens first name and he said it was Alexander.
               Stephens spelled it, "A L E X E N A N D E R." I asked Stephens
               what his middle name was and Stephens said, "Michelangelo, I'm
               sorry Michael." I asked For Stephens date of birth and he said,
               "2/19/2013." I told Michael that I did not think he was born in
               2013 and again asked his year of birth. Michael said "2014."
               For a third time I asked Michael what year he was born and
               Micahel said "1994." I handed my note pad to Intern Bonjukian
               who ran the information provided through dispatch. I asked
               Stephens if I could look at his eyes and he said I could. I
               told Stephens to stand with his heels and toes together and to
               follow the tip of my pen with his eyes only, keeping his head
               still. During the test I observed equal pupil size, equal
               tracking, lack of smooth pursuit, distinct and sustained
               nystagmus at maximum deviation, and onset of nystagmus prior to
               45 degrees in both eyes. During the test Stephens was swaying

               forwards and backwards. As Stephens stood before me I could
               smell the very strong odor of intoxicants coming from his
               breath. Dispatch stated that the name Stephens provided had no
               record. I asked Stephens how old he was and Stephens said he
               was 20 years old. I asked Stephens why he told me he as 21 the
               first time. Stephens said, "I know the law... I know I have to
               be 21 in order to drink." I asked Stephens what his last name
               was. Stephens said it was Alexander Michael Stephens. I did not
               ask Stephens to spell it. I asked Stephens what his date of
               birth was and Stephens said "02/18/94." Intern Bonjukian reran
               Stephens with the new date of birth. I asked Stephens why the
               first time I asked for his date of birth he said 02/19/94.
               Stephens replied, "I thought I said 19." Stephens words were so
               slurred I had to ask Stephens what he said. Stephens replied,
               "I thought I did tell you 18." Stephens went on to say, "you
               know, I know I did tell you 18 before, I know I am drunk, and I
               am sorry, I apologize." I asked Stephens if he was just worried
               that I would run his name and find out that he was not 21.
               Stephens said, "I did." I asked Stephens why he would tell me a
               wrong date of birth and Stephens said, "I knew I would get into
               trouble." I told Stephens that he was under arrest for MIP
               Exhibiting and making false of misleading statement to public
               servant. I handcuffed (D/L) Stephens and advised him that he
               was being audio and video recorded. I read Stephens his Miranda
               rights off my department issued card. Stephens stated he
               understood his rights and having them in mind he still wished
               to speak with me. Stephens was searched incident to arrest and
               placed in the backseat of my patrol car. Dispatch stated that
               they still were not getting a return for Stephens. I told
               Stephens that I was still not getting a return for his name and
               asked if his last name was Stephens. Stephens without prompt
               started to spell his last name, "S T E P H E N S." I asked
               Stephens why he told me his last name was spelled "Stevens" the
               first time. Stephens said he did not. I reminded Stephens that
               I record everything I do and the recording will show that he
               lied. Stephens said, "ok." At this point Stephens correctly
               spelled out his full name as, "Alexander Michael Stephens." I
               ran the new information on my MDC and obtained Stephens'
               return. I filled out a Sector citation for Stephens and told
               him I would drive him to his apartment at 545 NE Kamiaken St
               since he was clearly too intoxicated to walk there. Once at 545
               NE Kamiaken St, I issued Stephens his Sector citation. I
               explained it to him and provided Stephens with his copy.
               Stephens was released from custody and walked to his apartment.
               END OF REPORT I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 9th day of February, 2015, in

               09-19-95 DETOX 2. NARRATIVE: On 02-07-15 I was traveling east
               on Cougar Way when I saw a college age male, later identified
               as Alec D. Johnson, walking east. He was stumbling as he walked
               and on several occasions he almost fell on his face. As I drove
               past him I could clearly see he was under 21 years of age. I
               was getting ready to park my patrol car when Officer Westerman
               radioed that Johnson had tried to cross the street and was
               almost struck bu a vehicle. I stopped my car exited and turned
               on my body camera.By that time Johnson got to the cross walk at
               the PE Building. I asked him if he would stop- and talk to me.
               He said "No," heald up his right had extended the middle finger
               of his right hand and said "Fuck You." I could smell the odor
               of intoxicants coming from his breath as he spoke. I followed
               him across the street. When we were safely across. I told him
               he was not free to leave and grasp him by the right arm. He
               tried to pull away, but was not successful. I asked him if he
               had any identification and he mumbled something. he reached
               into his pocked and pulled out a bottle cap and a cough drop.
               He tried to give them to me. I told him that was not what I
               needed and again asked him for his identification. He just
               looked at me. I asked him his name and he said Johnson Alec. I
               asked him his middle name and he told me Johnson. After several
               attempts to find out his name I asked him his date of birth and
               he finally gave me 010494 then 090494. His actual DOB is 09-19-
               95 making him 19 years of age. This was confirmed through
               dispatch. I asked him where he was and he didn't know. I asked
               him where he lived and he said Streit Hall. I asked what room
               and he said 4404. That room doesn't exist. I asked him who the
               President of The United States was and he just looked at me. I
               asked him if is Was Reagan, Bush, Kennedy, but he stopped me at
               Kennedy and told me it was Kennedy. At that time I decided he
               was a candidate for detox. Pullman Fire was busy on several
               calls so I decided to transport him myself. At the hospital I
               filled out the Protective Custody paperwork and cleared. The
               video was later downloaded onto the s. drive. Nothing
               further................. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 7th day of February,

               a false statement to a public servant. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE

               & False Statement 5Z0277132 2. NARRATIVE: On 02-07-15 at about
               2346 hours I was on patrol traveling westbound on Linden St
               near Duncan Dunn when I observed a male and a female on the
               north sidewalk who were hugging. When they stopped hugging I
               saw that the male had a clear glass bottle in his left hand.
               When he saw me he tried to hide the bottle behind his leg. I
               stopped my patrol car and contacted the male and female. The
               male was still trying to hide the bottle behind his back when I
               contacted him. I asked to see the bottle and he brought it in
               front of him and told me to take it. At this time I could see
               that it was a bottle of Absolute Vodka with a small amount of
               liquid left in the bottom of it. I asked him to set it on the
               ground, which he did. As I spoke to the male, who was later
               identified as Julian C. Larsen, I could smell the odor of
               intoxicants on his breath. Neither he or the female appeared to
               be 21 years old. I asked them both for their ID's. The female
               provided a WSU Cougar Card that identified her as Kaylee M.
               Marcinko and she told me her birthday was 04-20-96. As she
               spoke I could smell the odor of alcohol on her breath and I
               could see that her eyes were bloodshot and watery. The male
               said he did not have ID with him. I asked what his name was and
               he told me "Jack". I asked what his last name was and he said
               "Larson, L-A-R-S-O-N". He told me his middle name was
               "Christian". Before providing any of his information Larsen
               would say "uh" before answering. He told me his birthday was
               03-08-96 and that his license was through Idaho. Before running
               Larsen I asked him if he was lying to me about any of his
               information and he said "no". I then asked if what was in the
               bottle was the same as what was on the label and they said yes,
               what was left of it. Marcinko told me that she only had a
               couple sips. At about this time I got the returns from Whitcom.
               I was told that Marcinko was clear but there was no record
               found for "Larson". I then told him he had one more opportunity
               to give me his real information. He paused and I told him he
               was lying about his name. He said "I'm sorry?" like he didn't
               hear me. I told him again he was lying to me. He paused again
               and said "Julian Larsen" with a smirk on his face. I asked him
               if he thought this was funny and he smiled. At this time I told
               Larsen that he was under arrest for MIP and for making a false

               statement. I informed Larsen that he was being audio and video
               recorded and of his right to an attorney. At about this time
               Officer Westerman arrived on scene and waited with Marcinko. I
               searched Larsen incident to arrest and found his WSU Cougar
               Card in his front left pants pocket. The photo on the Cougar
               Card matched Larsen and identified him as Julian Christian
               Larsen. I placed Larsen in the backseat of my patrol car and
               read him his Miranda Rigths from my department issued card.
               When I asked if he understood his rights he asked me to read
               them again, which I did. He then stated he understood his
               rights and said he would be willing to answer my questions. I
               tried asking Larsen questions about why he lied to me about his
               information but he only told me how all he wants is to go home.
               I then contacted Marcinko. I explained to her that I would be
               forwarding charges to the Whitman County Prosecutor for MIP
               Exhibiting (see case 15-W0613). She stated she understood. I
               also told her this information would be sent to student
               conduct. Marcinko was polite and cooperative throughout my
               contact with her. I told her she was free to leave. Westerman
               and I then used his Alco-Sensor FST PBT in passover mode to
               confirm whether or not the liquid in the bottle was alcohol.
               The PBT showed that the liquid in the bottle was "positive" for
               alcohol. The alcohol was then dumped on the ground and the
               bottle was thrown away. I returned to my patrol car and
               completed Sector citation 5Z0277132 for MIP and making a false
               or misleading statement to a public servant. I explained the
               citation to Larsen and gave him a copy. He was released from
               custody. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 8th day of February,
               2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               Forwarded MIP Exhibiting 2. NARRATIVE: On 02-07-15 at about
               2346 hours I was on patrol traveling westbound on Linden St
               near Duncan Dunn when I observed a male and a female on the
               north sidewalk who were hugging. When they stopped hugging I
               saw that the male had a clear glass bottle in his left hand.
               When he saw me he tried to hide the bottle behind his leg. I
               stopped my patrol car and contacted the male and female. The
               male was still trying to hide the bottle behind his back when I
               contacted him. I asked to see the bottle and he brought it in
               front of him and told me to take it. At this time I could see
               that it was a bottle of Absolute Vodka with a small amount of
               liquid left in the bottom of it. I asked him to set it on the
               ground, which he did. As I spoke to the male, who was later
               identified as Julian C. Larsen, I could smell the odor of
               intoxicants on his breath. Neither he or the female appeared to
               be 21 years old. I asked them both for their ID's. The female
               provided a WSU Cougar Card that identified her as Kaylee M.
               Marcinko and she told me her birthday was 04-20-96. As she
               spoke I could smell the odor of alcohol on her breath and I
               could see that her eyes were bloodshot and watery. The male
               said he did not have ID with him. I asked what his name was and
               he told me "Jack". I asked what his last name was and he said
               "Larson, L-A-R-S-O-N". He told me his middle name was
               "Christian". Before providing any of his information Larsen
               would say "uh" before answering. He told me his birthday was
               03-08-96 and that his license was through Idaho. Before running
               Larsen I asked him if he was lying to me about any of his
               information and he said "no". I then asked if what was in the
               bottle was the same as what was on the label and they said yes,
               what was left of it. Marcinko told me that she only had a
               couple sips, which is not consistent with what I was seeing. At
               about this time I got the returns from Whitcom. I was told that
               Marcinko was clear but there was no record found for "Larson".
               It was determined that Larson was lying about his name. He was
               arrested for MIP and making a false or misleading statement to
               a public servant. At about this time Officer Westerman arrived
               on scene and waited with Marcinko while I placed Laren in my
               patrol car (see case 15-W0612 for details). I then re-contacted
               Marcinko. I explained to her that I would be forwarding charges
               to the Whitman County Prosecutor for MIP Exhibiting. She stated

               she understood. I also told her this information would be sent
               to student conduct. Marcinko was polite and cooperative
               throughout my contact with her. I told her she was free to
               leave. Westerman and I then used his Alco-Sensor FST PBT in
               passover mode to confirm whether or not the liquid in the
               bottle was alcohol. The PBT showed that the liquid in the

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0615 SYNOPSIS: Henderson was arrested,
               cited and released for MIP and Making a false statement to a
               public servant. Jenkins was arrested, cited and released for

               NARRATIVE: On 02-08-15 at about 0051 hours I was on patrol,
               traveling northbound on Thatuna St near the bus stop when I
               observed a male and female on the east sidewalk. The two caught
               my attention because it appeared as if they were using each
               other for support as they both stumbled side to side while
               walking. I stopped my patrol car in the bus turnout lane and
               contacted the two near the "K House". As I approached them I
               could see a Gatorade bottle with liquid in it in the male's
               back pocket. I asked the two to stop, which they did, and they
               turned around. At this point I could see that the female
               appeared to be under the age of 21. I told them why I stopped
               them and asked where they were going. They gave me some general
               directions about where they were headed. As they both spoke I
               could smell the odor of alcohol on their breath. I could also
               see that they both had bloodshot, watery eyes and the female
               had slurred speech. I asked them both for ID. They told me that
               they did not have any identification with them. At about this
               time Officer Westerman arrived on scene. He asked the male what
               flavor his Gatorade was and the male said "Gatorade?".
               Westerman told him he was just curious because the color of the
               liquid in the bottle was not consistent with any of the known
               flavors of Gatorade. The male said he did not know. I confirmed
               that neither had ID and asked them to identify themselves. The
               female verbally identified herself as Liesel F. Jenkins, 10-24-
               95. The male verbally identified himself as AJ Henderson. I
               asked if "AJ" stood for anything and he told me that it was for
               Austin James. He told me his birthday was 12-15-93. While
               waiting for Whitcom to provide state returns to me I spoke with
               Jenkins about MIP Exhibiting and told her I was going to
               forward charges. I also spoke with Henderson about furnishing
               alcohol to minors and told him that I did not believe him that
               there was no alcohol in his Gatorade bottle. About this time
               Whitcom advisd that Jenkins was clear but there was no record
               found for Henderson. I asked Henderson about this and Westerman
               asked for him to just take his wallet out of his pocket. He
               then said that he meant to tell me 1992, not 1993. I explained

               to Henderson that people usually do not lie about their
               identity who are over the age of 21. Westerman then asked
               Henderson to just take his ID out of his wallet that was in his
               left back pocket. He said he did not have his ID in his wallet
               and told us his keys were in his wallet. I asked Jenkins to
               step away with me and I asked her how old Henderson was. She
               said 20 and that he was probably lying because he might have a
               fake ID in his wallet. At this time I asked Whitcom to check
               the same information with a year of birth 1994. There was still
               no record found. I also asked them to check 1995, with no
               record found. While I was talking with Jenkins about Henderson
               she told me that she was sure he had his ID on him. She then
               shouted "Cole, do you have your ID on you?" At this point I
               confirmed with Henderson what his real name is. He told me Cole
               Christian Henderson with a birthday of 06-08-94. I then told
               Henderson that he was under arrest for MIP Exhibiting and
               making a false statement to a public servant. I later realized
               I actually should have told Henderson he was under arrest for
               MIP, which is what the citation was issued for. I told
               Henderson he was being audio and video recorded and read him
               his Miranda Rights from my department issued card. Officer
               Westerman searched Henderson incident to arrest. During the
               search he found Henderson's wallet in his left back pocket
               which contained his WADL identifying him as Cole Christian
               Henderson/06-08-94. He also took the Gatorade bottle out of his
               pocket. He smelled the contents which had an odor similar to
               Fireball Whiskey. The presence of alcohol in the Gatorade
               bottle was later tested with Westerman's Alco-Sensor FST PBT in
               passover mode. The PBT gave a positive indication that alcohol
               was present. I witnessed Westerman pour out the contents onto
               the ground. I also told Jenkins that she was under arrest for
               MIP Exhibiting. I told her that she was being audio and video
               recorded and advised her of her right to an attorney. Henderson
               and Jenkins were escorted to my patrol car where I issued them
               both sector citations. I explained the citations to both and
               gave them each a copy. They were released from custody. Jenkins
               is a WSU Student, Henderson is not. Nothing further. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.

               0150 hours I was on a traffic stop on Washington St near Nevada
               when I saw a commotion in front of Waller Hall. I could see a
               parked taxi and several people standing around. I cleared my
               traffic stop and drove towards Waller Hall. As I approached I
               could see two males carrying another person up the stairs. It
               did not appear that the person being carried was moving. I got
               out of my car and told the guys to stop, which they did. The
               two males set the female down on the ground. She did not have
               shoes on and was only wearing one sock. One of the males was
               the taxi driver and the other said he was her boyfriend. The
               taxi driver was not identified and the boyfriend was only
               identified as "Dom". Dom told me the female's name was
               "Shonda". She was later identified as Seandalynn L. Faleagafulu
               (07-11-96). I tried talking to Shonda but she would not wake
               up. After several minutes she would try to mumble answers to my
               questions but she could not answer most of them. When I asked
               her how to spell her name she gave me the letters "Sendada
               Falndagan". I asked her where she had been tonight and she said
               "Sigma Nu". She also told me that she was still at Sigma Nu and
               that was where she was going to stay the night. She said she
               did not know who she was with right now. Dom told me that he
               was not with Faleagafulu at all tonight and had no idea how
               much she had to drink or what she was drinking. He said that he
               got a call from one of Faleagafulu's friends who said that she
               could not stay the night with them so he got a cab to go pick
               her up from Sigma Nu. He said that he lives at Waller Hall and
               was going to take care of her there. When the medics arrived
               Faleagafulu began vomitting. Once she was done the medics had
               to pick her up to put her on the gurney because she could not
               do so under her own power. She was transported to PRH via
               ambulance for detox. I provided a courtesy transport for Dom to
               PRH so he could be with Faleagafulu. Nothing further. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.

               didn't smell anything. In the past I have not detected the odor
               due to the residents covering up the jamb, so I knocted on the

               been sleeping and there was no odor coming from the room. I
               told the female why I was there. She said no one was smoking in
               the room. I apologized for waking her and ended the
