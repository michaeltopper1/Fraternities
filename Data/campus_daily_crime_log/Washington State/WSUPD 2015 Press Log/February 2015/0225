               of the CUB brought over the following items to be processed at
               the WSU PD lost and found department. 1. HCT smart phone in a
               grey and white Otter box case. Deanne Anderson was able to
               determine the owner to be Hannah Schweiter. She called Hannah's
               mother and advised her if she could get word to Hannah it would
               be great. Hannah came in the next morning, showed ID to prove
               ownership, signed the Found Propety Check-In Sheet form and her
               phone was released to her. 2. Fitbit Chip - I checked the Lost
               Property report book and found no reports of a lost Fitbit chip
               so I am putting this item in storage in hopes someone will come
               in and ask about it or contact us after it is advertised. 3.
               Zebra framed reading glasses. Nobody looking for them in the
               Lost Property report book so placing them in storage. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the

               expensive. CUB Staff is holding onto it as one staff member
               believes they know who it belongs to. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 022615 at approximately 1655
               hours I was dispatched to a found property case at the CUB info
               desk. CUB staff was concerned it was an expensive model of
               guitar. I responded and examined the guitar. Based on my
               personal experience I knew it not to be an expensive Fender.
               There was nothing with the guitar to identify the owner. I left
               the guitar with CUB staff in case the person returned to pick
               it up. I later returned and a CUB staff member believed he knew
               who owned the guitar and attempted contact via Facebook. I
               provided them with my card and told them I would return the
               following day at 1600 to see if the guitar had been picked up.
               Case pending. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
