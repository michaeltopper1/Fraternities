               apporximately 0858 hours Ofc. Jones and I were dispatched to
               Cougar Copies located in the CUB to take a property damage
               report. Ofc. Jones and I responded to Cougar Copies and we
               contacted the RP, Kurt L. Albrecht (10-22-56). Kurt told us the
               screen on one of their copy machines in Terrell Library was
               broken. Kurt showed us the pictures he had taken of the damage
               on his computer and he emailed me the photos. Kurt also has
               logs of who used the copy machine last and what time the
               machine was used and he also emailed me a copy of that
               information. Kurt said the copy machine was last used on 02-03-
               15 at approximately 1338 hours and the damage was noticed at
               about 0810 hours on 02-02-15. Kurt estimated the damage to be
               approximately $1000. Kurt took Ofc. Jones and I over to Terrell
               Library in order to show us the damaged copy machine. Kurt
               pointed out the copy machine marked #2 Coug Prints. There was
               an out of order sign placed over the broken screen. Kurt lifted
               the sign and showed us the busted touch screen and how the
               screen will not function. Ofc. Jones lifted the lid of the copy
               machine and there was a WA Drivers License, Darby A. Mackenzie
               (07-08-95) underneath of it. I could not find a local address
               listed for Mackenzie and I called her cell phone multiple
               times, but she has not answered any of my calls. Kurt said the
               copy machine was used a lot more than average on 02-03-15. Kurt
               said the copy machine usually averages $3 a day, but on 02-03-
               15 it made approximately $20. I took photographs of the damaged
               machine and we cleared the scene. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 4th day of

               (3) iPad Air's from Johnson Tower. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 02-04-15 at approximately 1119
               hours Officer Jones and I were dispatched to a theft at Johnson
               Tower room 211. Dispatch advised (3) iPad's were stolen out of
               a large group of 30 that were ordered. Ofc. Jones and I arrived
               at Johnson Tower room 211 and we met with the RP, Joyce M.
               Ehrlinger (04-02-74) who had us speak with their IT person
               Tyler J. Craigie (09-25-90). Craigie told us they had ordered
               30 iPad Air 16 GB, color Space Grey and model #A1474. Craigie
               told us there were three (3) separate boxes and each of them
               were suppose to contain ten (10) of the iPad Air's, but one of
               the boxes only contained seven (7) and was missing three (3).
               Ofc. Jones matched up the serial numbers of the iPad's with the
               serial numbers listed on the outside of the box to figure out
               which ones were missing. The serial numbers for the three (3)
               missing iPad Air's are: DMPP11JYFK10, DMPP12WXFK10,
               DMPP11Q1FK10. Three (3) chargers were also missing from the
               box. Craigie said once they received the boxes on 01-22-15 they
               had been locked up in his office. Craigie said when they opened
               the boxes today on 02-04-15 they discovered the three (3)
               iPad's and their chargers missing. The tape on the box with the
               missing iPad's look like it had been removed and put back on. I
               took photographs of the box and the shipping labels. Craigie
               said each iPad cost $374 for a total of $1,122. Both Craigie
               and Ehrlinger think the iPad's were stolen sometime during the
               shipping process from China. Ofc. Jones and I went to Receiving
               and Delivering on WSU Campus to see if they could give us any
               more information on the boxes delivered. Ofc. Jones and I spoke
               with Ofc. Jones and I spoke with Brady K. Allen (03-12-68) who
               was able to give us a copy of their delivery and shipping
               manifest sheet. Allen told us the driver was Bart A. Gabelmann
               (07-12-61) on 01-22-15 when the boxes were delivered. Ofc.
               Jones and I spoke with Gabelmann who said he remembers the box
               being sealed when he delivered it. We should Allen a picture of
               the way the box with the missing iPad's had been taped and him
               and his coworkers said they see packages sealed like that all
               the time and nothing appeared unusual to them. Allen told
               sometimes items fall out of boxes and are sent to UPS to be
               stored. UPS is going to look into it and then they will follow
               up with Apple who will reach the psych. **REPORT NOT FINISHED**

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Whitman / 323 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0545 SYNOPSIS: Responded to a possible
               theft call at the Southside Cafe. The male suspect paid for all
               items and dining center manager did not want to pursue charges.
               Nothing further. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Kim,
               Ji Won /022294 Warned Attempted Theft 2. NARRATIVE: On 02/04/15
               at about 1940 hours I was dispatched to a possible theft at the
               Southside Cafe. I responded and talked to the Cafe manager
               Donald M. Brabb 082558, and Taha Kabbaj 042890, a student
               manger at the cafe. Kabbaj said a male later identified as Ji
               W. Kim 022294, was eating bread sticks while in line waiting
               for his burger to cook. Kabbaj talked to Kim and told him not
               eat while in line. Kabbaj also told Kim he needed to pay for
               the items he had eaten. When Kim went through the cashier line
               he only paid for three bread sticks when he had eaten four
               while in line. Kabbaj confronted Kim and asked him why he had
               not paid for all the items he had taken and eaten. Kim told
               Kabbaj that he had told the cashier four but was only charged
               for three. Kim paid for an additional bread stick after this
               confrontation. Kabbaj was attempting to explain the consequence
               of taking food, and that it was considered theft and could lead
               to the police getting involved. Kim told Kabbaj to go ahead and
               call the police then. Brabb then called the police and detained
               Kim. I talked to Kim and he said he told the cashier four bread
               sticks when he was paying for his food. I asked if he got a
               receipt, he said he did not. He also said he paid for the
               fourth bread stick. I talked to Taylor N. Vigilia 041494, who
               was the cashier who helped Kim. She stated he did say four
               bread sticks and did not know why only three were charged the
               first time. I talked with Kim again and explained he was not
               supposed to be eating food while in line and he also needed to
               purchase all food that he takes while in the cafe. I warned him
               he could be charged with theft for food that he eats and does
               not pay for. Brabb did not want to pursue charges. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 4th day of February, 2015, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer
