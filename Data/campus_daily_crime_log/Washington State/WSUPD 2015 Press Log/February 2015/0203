               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0518 SYNOPSIS: Subject wrecked on his
               bike. I transported him to PRH. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 020315 at approximately 1606
               hours we were dispatched to an injured bicyclist at Wilson and
               Stadium Way. Ofc. Kirshner and I responded. Ofc. Kirshner made
               initial contact with the injured person, Luke M. Abdelnoor
               (081394), while I interviewed a witness and took photographs. I
               spoke with Silvia Garcia-Madrigal (093091) who had seen
               Abdelnoor wreck. She stated he had come down the hill from NE
               Wilson Rd, heading west to east. He went off the curb and
               crashed, landing face first about 3.5 to the south of the
               crosswalk. She said the walk sign was on for his direction. She
               stated he was going a little fast with pedestrians nearby. She
               then assisted in getting him and his bike to the sidewalk. I
               spoke with Abdelnoor and checked on his medical condition. He
               appeared to have a laceration to his upper lip and had knocked
               out one of his front teeth. Ofc. Kirshner retrieved the tooth
               from the roadway and gave it to medics when they arrived.
               Abdelnoor stated he had ridden down Wilson Rd and expected a
               curb cut directly in front of him instead it was off to the
               left, so he rode off the curb. When he landed his front tire
               came loose from the fork and wedged between the frame and the
               chainring. Abdelnoor went over the handle bars and landed on
               his face. He did not loose consciousness. He was not wearing a
               helmet. The front dropout quick release appeared to be intact.
               The front tire was popped but the rim seemed to be in decent
               condition. The bike was a yellow ATX840 by Giant. Ofc. Kirshner
               took it back to the station for safekeeping. After medics
               cleared Abdelnoor I transported him to PRH. I provided him with
               my business card and the case number to get the bike back. I
               placed the bike in the evidence room. I cleared. Nothing
               follows. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 3rd day of February, 2015, in Pullman,

               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 02-03-15, at approximately
               1808 hours, the WSU Facilities Operations operator called
               Whitcom stating a teal Geo Metro (ID/1LB1731) had pulled into
               the McCluskey Services parking lot, pulled into a parking
               stall. She said it looked as if a male was talking on a cell
               phone. She was concerned because the shops had been closed for
               over an hour and it was odd for someone to pull into the
               parking lot that late. I responded to the area and was informed
               by dispatch the car was leaving the parking lot without the
               male having exited the vehicle. I caught up to the car as it
               was leaving the parking lot and followed it until it turned
               toward Moscow, Idaho on Highway 270. I had no legal reason to
               conduct a traffic stop with the vehicle so I did not. I called
               the Facilities Operations operator and informed her what I had
               determined. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,

               "CUNT" written on the white board outside of room 115. I spoke
               with the occupant of room 115 who requested a hall meeting with

               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 02/03/15 at 2129 hours
               I was called to a harassment at Olympia Hall room 115 where
               someone had written the word "CUNT" on a whiteboard outside of
               room 115. Upon arrival I met with the RED, Britteny L. Alspach
               04/04/89 and Rebecca A. King 03/27/96. King lives in room 115.
               I photographed the whiteboard which was later added to the
               files folder. Alspach, King, and I went to the study room to
               speak about the issue. King stated that over the last few
               months she has found her door decorations taken off her door
               and propped up against the door so they fell into the room when
               she opened the door. King said someone has also been witting
               derogatory words on her whiteboard such as "BITCH", "CUNT", and
               drawing penis's. I asked King if she had seen similar things
               written on other people's whiteboards and she said no. King
               stated she has not been having any conflicts with anybody on
               her floor. King said she thought that there was a male down the
               hallway who might have been responsible because he uses the
               word cunt often. King confronted the male who denied being
               responsible. King stated she wanted to know her options about
               this. I told King at minimum this case would be sent to OEO for
               the word used. I told King that I could go talk to people she
               suspected of witting the word if she wanted. I also threw out
               the option of putting on a hall meeting with the RED, RA's, and
               an Officer present. King stated that she thought a hall meeting
               would stop the issue. King stated that she believed that
               someone is messing with her to be funny but she is tired of it.
               I told King and RED Alspach that I was more than willing to
               show up for a hall meeting and if I could not make it another
               Officer would attend. I provided King and Alspach with my
               business card and case number. I told Alspach to email in the
               next few weeks for the plan for the hall meeting. I urged King
               to call in any other incidents that occur. This case will be
               referred to the Office of Equal Opportunity. END OF REPORT. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and

               Illegal Fireworks 2. Todd E. Lehman 02/23/95 Student Conduct
               Poss. of Marijuana NARRATIVE: On February 3rd, 2015 at
               approximately 2221 hours I was driving northbound on North
               Fairway Rd when a bronze Isuzu Rodeo SUV pulled out from North
               Fairway Lane onto North Fairway Rd in front of me. I was
               driving approximately 20 MPH and the Rodeo was pulling away
               from me. I came to a stop in the middle of the roadway and
               activated my in car (vehicle 4) stationary radar. I obtained a
               reading of 30 MPH in the posted 20 MPH zone. I caught up to the
               car and initiated a traffic stop. I contacted the driver, Todd
               E. Lehman 02/23/95, identified myself, informed Lehman I was
               recording, and explained the reason for the stop. As Lehman
               provided his WADL in noticed a small plastic container next to
               the instrument cluster. I instantly recognized the brown waxy
               material inside the container to be "DABS" which is a
               concentrated version of marijuana. I asked to see the container
               and Lehman handed it to me. It smelled of marijuana. I asked
               Lehman if he had a medical marijuana card and he said no. I
               spoke with Lehman outside of the car and asked for his consent
               to search the car. I informed Lehman of the Ferrier Warnings
               and asked Lehman having the warning's in mind, did I have his
               consent to search. Lehman said no because the car was his
               friends car. Lehman said he was just borrowing the car. Lehman
               stated the owner of the car was over 21 years old. I explained
               because he was in control of the vehicle and under the age of
               21 I would be applying for a search warrant. I had Lehman sit
               on the front of my patrol car's bumper. Around this time Ofc.
               Petlovany arrived on scene. I next spoke with Joshua James
               Thompson-Finn 12/20/91. I asked Finn if he had any property in
               the car that belonged to him. Finns stated that just the duffel
               bag that was on the passenger's seat floorboard belonged to
               him. I informed Finn of the Ferrier Warnings and asked for
               Finn's consent to search his property. Finn said I could
               search. I searched Finn's buffel bag and found no illegal
               items. I had Finn join Lehman near the front of my bumper. I
               told the two that I would be applying for a search warrant to
               search the car. I told Finn and Lehman that they were free to
               go and no longer detained. Lehman asked about the car and I

               told him that if my search warrant was granted, I would search
               the car, and seize any illegal items. Once the search was
               complete I could turn over the car to the owner. Lehman left me
               his phone number to call when the search was completed. By
               looking from outside of the vehicle I can see a large bong in
               the backseat and several sandwich bags that had trace amounts
               of marijuana in them. I applied for and was granted a search
               warrant for the Rodeo by Judge Robinson. Once the search
               warrant was granted I read a copy of the warrant to the car.
               Once completed the search began. During the search, Ofc. Boyd,
               Ofc. Petlovany, Intern Dominguez, and I were present. During
               the search the following items were seized: -4 glass stems with
               residue -19 small plastic containers with marijuana concentrate
               -1 unused plastic container identical to other with marijuana
               concentrate -1 metal grinder with marijuana inside -1 large
               piece with marijuana concentrate residue -1 envelope containing
               $430 dollars in cash -1 large red glass bong -1 sandwich bag
               with fresh marijuana -1 large bag of illegal fireworks During
               the search I found documents belonging to Alexander Chung-Pei
               Chen 02/15/94. The documents were labeled "documentation of
               health care professional's authorization to engage in the
               medical use of cannabis in Washington State." The document had
               Chen's name and date of birth printed on it. I photographed the
               document and later uploaded the photo's to the files folder.
               Once the search was completed I called Lehman. Lehman stated he
               would be right over to get the car. Lehman also stated that the
               car's owner Chen would be coming too. Once Lehman, Chen, and
               Finn arrived back on scene I told Lehman and Chen I had some
               question about the items I located. I read Lehman and Chen
               their Miranda Rights off my preprinted card. Both stated they
               understood their rights and having them in mind still wished to
               speak with me. Both said they would talk to me. I told Chen
               that based on how the marijuana concentrate was packaged into
               one gram units, the money found, and the unused container leads
               me to believe that Chen is selling the seized marijuana. I
               asked Chen to speak to what I found. Chen stated he has a
               medical marijuana authorization and he does not go back home
               very often. So when he does go home he buys large quantities of
               marijuana products to last him here in Pullman. Chen stated
               that the money found in the glove box which was next to more
               marijuana concentrate was Christmas money from his parents. I
               asked Chen why he would keep such a large amount of money in
               his car. Chen stated he lives in a Fraternity House so he
               decides to keep it in his car. Chen and Lehman spoke briefly
               and Chen stated all the marijuana products were his. Chen said
               Lehman was only borrowing his car. I asked Chen if he often
               lets other people borrow his car and Chen said yes. I asked if
               it was common for him to let others borrow his car with
               marijuana in it and Chen said no. It was clear that Chen uses
               his car for storage of all his marijuana and marijuana related
               items. I told Chen that I would refer my case to the prosecutor
               and note that he claimed the marijuana was all his. I told
               Lehman that just because Chen claimed the marijuana to be his
               did not mean that he was not in possession of the marijuana as
               he drove the car without Chen present. I told the two it would

               be up to the prosecutor on the charges of this case. Both
               stated they understood. Based on the amount of money, the
               quantity of containers found, and none of the containers had
               any marks showing that they came from a medical marijuana
               dispensary there is probable cause that the money was from
               illegal gains and the possession of the marijuana concentrate
               was for the intention of sales. The seized items were logged
               into evidence. Photos of the illegal fireworks were taken. I
               turned the fireworks over to Ofc. Jones who took them to the
               Pullman Fire Department for destruction. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of

               advised that hall staff at Goldsworthy Hall was reporting the
               odor of marijuana coming from room 516. Hall staff had already
               contacted the resident of the room and they were out with the
               subject at the time of the call. I responded and contacted the
               resident of the room, Austin M. Reibman (100395), who was in
               the hallway with hall staff upon my arrival. Reibman denied
               having any marijuana in his room and said his room did not
               smell like marijuana. He told me I could go in his room with
               him to smell the room but said I could not look through
               anything. I entered the room and could smell the odor of burnt
               marijuana in the room as soon as the door was opened. Reibman
               insisted I open his refrigerator and smell the teriyaki
               leftovers he had because he believed that was the smell. I did
               so and told him the leftovers were not the smell I was
               smelling. I told him his room smelled like burnt marijuana. He
               insisted he did not have any marijuana in the room and had not
               been smoking in the room. Reibman said his friends had been
               smoking marijuana before arriving at his room so the smell was
               probably from their clothing. I told him he was responsible for
               anything in his room so if he did have marijuana in his room to
               get rid of it. I also instructed him he should probably tell
               his friends to leave should they come to his room in the future
               with marijuana or smelling like marijuana because they might
               get him in trouble. Nothing further. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               04 day of February, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               CASE #: SYNOPSIS: Report of the odor of marijuana coming from
               222 Gannon Hall. A search warrant was served. Charges forwarded
               for possession of marijuana. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 01/19/15 at about 2319 hrs
               Dispatch advised hall staff at Gannon Hall was reporting the
               odor of marijuana coming from room 222 of Gannon Hall. I
               contacted the on call RED for Gannon, Britteny L. Alspach
               (040489), who told me she was contacted by RA's who smelled a
               strong odor of marijuana coming from room 222 Gannon Hall. She
               responded and confirmed there was a strong odor of marijuana
               coming from room 222 Gannon Hall. I asked Alspach on a scale of
               1-10, with 10 being the highest how sure she was the odor was
               marijuana and she said a 10. I asked her on the same scale, how
               sure she was the odor was coming from room 222 and she said 10.
               Alspach has reported the odor of marijuana in the past and has
               proved to be a reliable source of information. I asked Alspach
               if she know how old the residents of the room were and she said
               she believed they were both under 21. There was a previous
               incident at that room involving marijuana on 01/19/15. The
               resident who was contacted at that time was Colin C. Quang
               (091195). Quang's birthdate obtained at the time of the contact
               indicates he is under the age of 21. I contacted Whitman County
               District Court Judge Douglas B. Robinson on the phone. I
               applied for, and was granted, search warrant #SW020415A for
               room 222 Gannon Hall. Officer Westerman, Officer Petlovany,
               Intern Dominquez, and I went to room 222 Gannon Hall. Upon
               arrival I could smell a very strong odor of a body spray type
               deodorant, which I know is commonly used as a cover up scent by
               students when they smoke marijuana in their dorm rooms. I
               knocked on the door and announced police, search warrant, open
               the door. After the second knock and announce the door opened
               and male, later identified as Collin A. Schweikl (052396),
               asked what was going on. I grabbed him by the arm and directed
               him out of the room. I told him I had a search warrant to
               search his room. I placed him in handcuffs (double locked). I
               explained to him he was not under arrest at that time but was
               being detained while we served the warrant. I read Schweikl his
               Constitutional Rights from a pre-printed card and advised him
               he was being recorded. Schweikl said he understood his rights.
               When I asked if I could ask him some questions he asked what
               the questions were. I told him I was going to read the search
               warrant first and then I would ask the questions, which he
               could choose to answer or not. I read the search warrant to

               NARRATIVE: On 02/04/15 at approximately 0019 hours I responded
               to an emergency button activation at the Football Operations
               Building. Dispatch stated the activation came from the south
               stairwell on the first floor. Dispatch could hear voices in the
               background laughing and talking but they would not respond to
               dispatch. Upon arrival I found the emergency button which is
               just outside the Football locker room. There were several
               players changing and heading home after a practice. I walked
               around and found no emergency. The emergency button was most
               likely pressed accidentally. END OF REPORT I certify and
