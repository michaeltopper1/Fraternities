               0736 hours WSU Police were toned out to a burglary alarm at the

               workers accidentally activated the alarm when entering the

               is alarmed. The Paint Shop employees were in the building to do
               a quote for interior painting. Officer Stewart deactivated the
               alarm and counseled the workers. No further investigation. I

               On 02-18-15 at approximately 2152 hours, I was on patrol near
               the Observatory, when I observed a vehicle parked at the dead
               end of the roadway over looking the Vet Hospital. As I drove
               towards the vehicle, I could see the occupants moving around
               like they were hiding stuff in the vehicle. I turned on my spot
               light to illuminate the passengers since they were moving, and
               I got out of my vehicle. As I approached the vehicle, I could
               see it was running, the driver's window was open, and there
               were five passengers in the seats and a sixth one laying down
               in the back under a blanket. The vehicle was a station wagon
               type vehicle. As I got close, I could smell and overwhelming
               odor of marijuana emitting from the vehicle. I activated my
               camera and advised them all I was recording. I asked what they
               were doing and the driver stated they were just looking at the
               stars. I asked how old everyone in the car was and they all
               said 19. I could see each individuals face and observed they
               all had very bloodshot eyes which appeared watery. I asked if
               anyone was medical marijuana patient and they all said no. I
               told them I could smell the odor of marijuana emitting from the
               car and asked who had the marijuana. I observed all of them
               look down to the floorboards avoiding eye contact. I then asked
               them all to produce their identifications and they did. The
               driver was identified as Jasmine A. Leach, the front passenger
               was Jacob W. Robin, the rear passenger on the passenger's side
               was Amari N. Franklin, the middle rear passenger was William A.
               C. Britton, the passenger behind the driver was Zachary J.
               Perry, and the female in the rear of the vehicle was Sarah F.
               Blanchet. I again asked who the marijuana belonged to and Sarah
               stated it was her's. I asked her if she would step out of the
               vehicle and I had to open the back hatch door to let her out. I
               asked her to retrieve the marijuana from the car and I observed
               her get if from Jacob. She handed me a mason jar which had

               about two grams of marijuana in the bottom of it. The jar had
               Sarah written on it. I asked her what was used to smoke it and
               she said there was a pipe and they used joints. I told her to
               go get everything from the vehicle. She retrieved items from
               the front and rear passenger areas. She produced a water bong
               which had residue all over it, it's case, three small glass
               pieces in a metal box which she stated was used for smoking
               joints (one had residue on it), a black grinder with gvm
               residue in it, and a plastic bag containing a purple grinder
               with gvm residue and a blue glass pipe in it. I advised all of
               them I would be forwarding charges to the prosecutor's office
               for Possession of Marijuana, since they all appeared to be
               under the influence and the items came from around all of them.
               None of them denied having used marijuana. I also issued
               Jasmine a verbal warning and spoke to her in detail about
               Driving Under the Influence of a Drug or being in Physical
               Control of a Vehicle after Having Consumed a Drug. She stated
               she understood. I told her to try and find someone who was
               sober to come get the vehicle, and if she couldn't then the
               vehicle would be parked and they could walk. I seized the items
               Sarah had turned over to me as they had marijuana residue on
               them or burned on to them. I asked the group if they had any
               questions and they said no. I returned to the station and put
               the evidence in an evidence locker. I later downloaded my video
               of the incident. When I asked each of them for their room
               numbers, I recognized the rooms as having been contacted prior
               for marijuana. All but Sarah and Jacob have previous contacts
               with our department. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 19th day of February,
               2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               < 40 2. NARRATIVE: On 02-19-15 at approximately 0117 hours, I
               responded to Stephenson South for the report of the odor of
               marijuana emitting from room 615. I put my nose to the door of
               615 and could clearly smell the odor of marijuana emitting from
               the room. I knocked and contacted the residents who were
               identified as Jake M. Daniels and Scott R.R. Harris. Neither
               resident were 21 years of age. Jake admitted to having
               marijuana in the room and pulled out a sandwich bag containing
               about 3 grams of marijuana based on my training and experience.
               Jake stated Scott had nothing to do with the marijuana and
               stated he had smoked a joint earlier. I issued both of them
               warnings. I escorted Jake out to the dumpster and witnessed him
               dispose of the marijuana. I advised him I would be forwarding
               his information to Student Conduct and he stated he understood.
               I cleared. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
