    Narrative: RVWD: ENW/328 OFC: JAK/333 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0755 SYNOPSIS: Mari L. Stair called
               Whitcom stating there was a black male standing outside of the
               "500's Building" of the Terrace Apartments. She said the male
               was suspiciously looking toward the "400's" building of the
               apartment complex and she thought the male may be staring at a
               woman. I spoke with the male and he was not doing anything
               wrong or illegal. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 02-15-15, at approximately 0858 hours, Mari L.
               Stair called Whitcom stating there was a black male standing
               outside of the "500's Building" of the Terrace Apartments. She
               said the male was suspiciously looking toward the "400's"
               building of the apartment complex and she thought the male may
               be staring at a woman. She said the same male does this often.
               I responded to the area of the Terrace Apartments. Upon my
               arrival I saw a black male; later identified as Anthony E.
               Thomas (07-17-92), standing of the "500's" building. The male
               appeared to be looking in the direction of the "400's"
               building, but I did not see anyone he could be looking at.
               After watching Thomas for several minutes, he recognized I was
               watching him and began walking toward my direction. I spoke
               with the male and asked him what he was doing. He said he was
               just enjoying the weather. I asked him if he lived in the
               Terrace Apartments and he said he lived in the Steptoe Village
               apartments. I asked him if he knew anyone who lived in the
               Terrace apartments and he said he had a "Home Girl" who lived
               in one of the apartments, but he did not say which apartment. I
               spoke with him for approximately 10 minutes and as we spoke, he
               looked toward the "400's" building several times. I asked him
               what he was looking at and if he was looking for someone or
               something and he continued to say he wasn't looking at anything
               in particular. Near the end of our conversation he looked at
               his cell phone and quickly left the area. Although Thomas was
               acting a bit unusual, he was not doing anything wrong or
               illegal. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 16th day of February,
               2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               Asian male who was sitting by the door who they think he
               thought he could use it as an exit. Case told us the employee
               spoke with the Asian male and told him not to use that door
               anymore. Ofc. Kirshner and I responded to the 6th floor to

               sounded like 2 cars racing. It sounded like the cars were
               somewhere on Stadium Way, with extremely loud exhaust and quick
               acceleration. At about this time Officer Westerman advised over
               the radio that he was at the office and could hear sqealing
               tires and loud exhaust towards the area of what sounded like
               the CUE Parking Garage. I began driving towards Stadium Way
               when I heard Officer Whitman advise he saw two cars on Orchard
               that could possibly be involved. I stopped my patrol car and
               could hear the same loud exhaust that I had heard moments
               earlier. I then saw two small passenger cars come to a stop at
               the stop sign of Fairway Lane and N. Fairway. Officer Whitman
               was behind them and had activated his emergency lights. Both
               cars stopped on N. Fairway in front of Beasley Coliseum, I
               activated my emergency lights and stopped behind the vehicles.
               I contacted the driver of the first car, WA/283ZJI, a Honda
               Accord. The driver was identified as Dakota S. Hanson. I asked
               Hanson what was going on. He told me that the other car, the
               car behind him, was following him and he was scared. He said he
               did not know who the people were and that he was trying to go
               home but did not want them to know where he lived so he was
               driving around, trying to lose them. He said he had no idea who
               they were and that they just started following him when he left
               the parking garage moments earlier. I asked what he was doing
               in the parking garage and he said he was just hanging out with
               friends. At about this time I heard Whitcom advise that both
               vehicle plates returned to Dakota Hanson. I told Hanson to stay
               in his car. I then went and spoke to Whitman. Whitman told me
               that the passenger in the second car, Heather Stanley, had
               received a text message from Dakota that contained a picture
               from the top floor of the CUE parking garage, looking out to
               the ground, with the caption "Should I jump?" This message was
               sent at 9:21 PM. Heather said that she told Dakota no, and told
               her boyfriend, Joshua G. Pecora, that they needed to go find
               Dakota. Heather also said that she used to date Dakota and that
               he was probably upset that she was now dating Josh. I returned

               to Dakota's car and asked him to be honest with me about what
               was going on tonight. He said that he is just dealing with a
               lot of stuff. I asked him if he sent that picture and "should I
               jump" to Heather and he said yes. I asked him if he felt like
               hurting himself. He said he felt that way a few minutes ago,
               but not anymore. I asked Dakota if he had attempted suicide in
               the past and he said that he thinks about it a lot. I asked him
               what his method would be and he said that there are a lot of
               ways to choose from. As I spoke to Dakota he seemed very
               depressed. I asked Dakota if he has ever talked with a
               counselor and he said yes, but none of them have ever helped. I
               asked him what his plans were for the rest of the night and he
               said he did not know, probably go home. I talked with Dakota
               about what was making him feel this way tonight and he
               explained that he is "basically brothers" with Josh and that he
               used to date Heather. He said that it is hard seeing somebody
               you love with somebody else. He also told me that he is
               stressed about money and bills. I asked Dakota if he was going
               to hurt himself tonight and he said probably not. I returned to
               Josh and Heather and asked if this behavior is out of the
               ordinary for Dakota and they said yes. Josh said that when
               Heather showed the text messages to him he was very concerned
               that Dakota was going to hurt himself so they went to find him.
               He said when they found him in the parking garage, Dakota got
               in his car and left. He said they followed him. Josh said that
               they were following Dakota to make sure he wasn't going to hurt
               himself. I asked Heather if I could see the text messages that
               he and Dakota had exchanged and she said yes. She then showed
               me a series of text messages that started at 9:21 PM and had
               continued into the time that both cars had been stopped. The
               first message started with the picutre from the top floor of
               the parking garage captioned "Should I jump" and proceeded with
               Heather saying NO. They exchanged several texts. Dakota said
               several times that he was going to jump, stating he had nothing
               to live for and that he was an empty shell. I returned to
               Dakota's car. I told him that I was not convinced he wasn't
               going to hurt himself tonight. When I said this he kept his
               head down, he did not deny it. I told him that I was concerned
               for his safety. He said ok, and was only concerned about going
               to jail. I told him that I was not going to take him to jail
               but felt like he should speak with a counselor. He said he
               would call some friends to take care of him. I told him that
               was not an option and he'd be going to the hospital. Dakota
               made arrangements for a friend to pick up his car. He was
               placed in protective custody. Officer Whitman searched Dakota
               and placed him in the back seat of my patrol car. I transported
               him to PRH and completed the Release of Adult Protective
               Custody paperwork. A copy of the form was uploaded to Spillman
               Files and vievu video was placed on the S: drive. See Officer
               Whitman's report for additional details. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               16th day of February, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               was dispatched to an intoxicated female at Community Duncan
               Dunn room 289. I arrived and talked to the intoxicated female,
               Billie J. Risheim (051796). She was in her bed face down and
               did not roll over to talk to me. I asked her how much she had
               to drink. She said she had not been drinking. Risheim speech
               was slurred and she would repeat answers from previous
               questions instead of answering the new questions. She was able
               to correctly answer who the President of the United States was,
               but when I asked where she was and she answered "the capital of
               United States". Pullman Fire Department arrived and began to
               evaluate Risheim. She was very uncooperative and at one point
               called the paramedic evaluating her a "fuck boy". Pullman Fire
               personal determined that Risheim did not need to be transported
               to the hospital and left her in the care of her roommate
               Courtney J. Rogers (030396). This is the third case involving
