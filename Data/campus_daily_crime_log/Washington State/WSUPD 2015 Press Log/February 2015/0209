               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0635 SYNOPSIS: WSU vehicle found to have
               damage to its front windshield. Damage most likely caused by a
               baseball. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 02/09/15 at approximately 1050 I responded to Johnson Hall
               parking lot where I met with Evan Davies. Davies stated today
               at approximately 1000 hours he went to his department's 1995
               Jeep Cherokee to move it. Davies stated he noticed a large hole
               in the front windshield of the Jeep. Davies stated he had
               parked the Jeep behind the Air Supported Structure at
               approximately 1700 hours on 02/06/15 and there was no damage at
               that time. I asked Davies if he saw anything out of the
               ordinary around the Jeep and he said no. The hole was near the
               driver's side dash area. The glass was shattered in a way that
               made it look like a circular object struck it in a downward
               motion. The hole was approximately the size of a baseball. Due
               to the the Jeep being behind the baseball field it is most
               likely that a foul ball struck the Jeep causing the damage. The
               damage to the windshield was photographed and uploaded to the
               files folder. The windshield will have to be replaced. The
               damage is estimated at $350 dollars. I provided Davies with my
               business card and his case number. I cleared shortly
               thereafter. END OF REPORT I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 9th day of February,

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0636 SYNOPSIS: Hannelore K. Luderer (DOB
               11-27-1939) reported the theft of mail she had sent to her
               granddaughter in Perham Hall. Upon further investigation, I
               located the mail and determined that it had not been stolen.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 02-09-
               2015 at about 1210 hrs I was dispatched to a report of a theft
               at Perham Hall, located at 1624 NE Cougar Way. I contacted the
               complainant, Hannelore K. Luderer (DOB 11-27-1939), on the
               telephone. Luderer reported that between 12-31-2014 and 01-29-
               2015 she sent her granddaughter three letters to her residence,
               Perham Hall #113. Luderer stated that her granddaughter never
               received the letters. Luderer said the letters contained
               important financial information and a bank check. Luderer's
               granddaughter was identified as Anna V. Stepitova (DOB 10-07-
               1995). With the assistance of WSU mailing services and hall
               staff at the Perham Hall front desk, I checked Stepitova's
               mailbox and located all three of Luderer's letters. It was
               determined that Stepitova had simply not checked her mailbox
               and had not communicated this to Luderer. I contacted Luderer
               on the telephone and advised her of the situation. The original
               report of a theft is unfounded. No further investigation at
               this time. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this __09__ day of

               95) came to the WSU Police Department stating someone calling
               herself Donna called her stating she stole her grandmother's
               identity and she was going to be arrested. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: Nahtasha M. Shook (12-04-
               95) came to the WSU Police Department stating someone calling
               herself Donna called her stating she stole her grandmother's
               identity and she was going to be arrested. Shook said her
               grandmother lives near Fullbrook, California and is in the
               early stages of Dementia. She said she spoke with her
               grandmother in late July or early August of 2014 about having
               her be a co-signer on a student loan with her. She said her
               grandmother gave her all of her information which would be
               required for her to be the co-signer on the loan. Shook said
               her grandmother was not computer literate and since all of the
               Sally Mae loans are done online, her grandmother gave her
               permission to enter her information on her behalf. Shook did so
               and took out a $7600 student loan. Shook said she received
               several phone calls from (951) 905-8266 around 1040 this
               morning, but she did not answer as she was in class. She said a
               woman left her the following voice message: "Umm Hey Nahtasha,
               It's a County of San Diego Police Department. Could you give me
               a call back at (951) 905-8266? Thank You" Shook said she tried
               calling the phone number when she got out of class at 1200, but
               her phone call went to voice mail. She said the phone number's
               voice mail message was not professional and sounded like
               someone answering a phone call and then stating "Leave a
               message". Shook said she immediately suspicious as the message
               did not sound like the type of voice mailbox greeting a Police
               Department would use so she called the San Diego Police
               Department at (619) 531-2000. She was told by a female at the
               Police Department that the phone number (951) 905-8266 was not
               associated with the San Diego Police Department. She advised
               Shook to call the City of Fallbrook Police Department at
               (858)565-5200 as this is where her grandmother lives. She did
               so and was told the phone number (951) 905-8226 was not
               associated with the City of Fallbrook Police Department either.
               At approximately 1230 hours, Shook called (951) 905-8226 again.
               This time a woman answered the phone and identified herself as
               Donna. Shook said Donna identified herself as a Police Officer,
               but would not give Shook her last name, badge number, or Police
               Case number. She said Donna accused her of stealing her
               grandmother's identity and applying for a loan using her

               information without her permission. Shook said Donna was very
               loud, rude, argumentative, and told her several times she was
               going to be arrested and jailed. Shook again tried to get
               Donna's last name, badge number, and Police case number, but
               Donna hung up the phone. This is when she came in to the WSU
               Police Department. After speaking with Shook about what had
               occurred, I asked her to call Donna and put the call on speaker
               mode. Shook asked Donna what her last name was and she said it
               did not matter. She asked her what she ultimately wanted and
               Donna said she wanted the loan payments to be made by Shook as
               they were outstanding and she wanted Shook to be held
               responsible for signing for her Shook's grandmother without her
               permission. At this point I identified myself as a Washington
               State University Police Officer and tried to get more
               information from Donna. I asked her if she told Shook she was a
               Police Officer and she would not respond, choosing to change
               the subject and tried to talk over me. I asked her what her
               last name was and she said it did not matter. She loudly, and
               rudely accused Shook of having stolen her grandmother's
               identity and having her put on a loan as a co-signer without
               permission. After I was able to somewhat calm Donna down, I
               gave her all of my information and the WSU Police Case Number
               for the call. I explained what Shook's grandmother needed to do
               if she wanted to file a Police Report and told her she could
               contact me anytime if she had more questions. I warned her it
               was against the law to impersonate a Police Officer or create
               an impression that he or she is a Police Officer. She said she
               understood and we ended the phone call. I gave Shook my
               business card with her Police Case Number on it and advised her
               to do the following: 1. Make all of the loan payments so she
               could pay it off as soon as possible. 2. Try to see if she can
               get her grandmother taken off of the loan. 3. If contacted by
               an actual Law Enforcement Agency, to cooperate fully. She said
               she understood and left the Police Department. Nothing further
               at this time. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 9th day of February, 2015, in

               You, Fuck You" over and over. Alqahtani demanded they send him
               some paperwork explaining why he supposedly owed the men money
               and they hung up. Alqahtani did not provide the males with any
               of his financial information and merely wanted the incident
               reported. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 9th day of February,
               2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               Conduct Poss. of Marijuana 2. NARRATIVE: On 02/09/15 at
               approximately 2243 hours I was dispatched to drugs call at
               Orton Hall room 528. Upon arrival I noticed the hallway smelled
               strongly of burnt marijuana. As I reached room 528 a male
               exited the room. The male was later identified as Kevin James
               Cote 06/30/95. I told Cote that I was called to his room for
               marijuana and asked why he had been smoking inside. Cote said
               when he usually smokes it doesn't smell so strong. I asked Cote
               if he had a medical marijuana card and he said no. I told Cote
               that as long as he was willing to turn over his marijuana and
               smoking devices he would only be referred to student conduct.
               Cote agreed to my statement. Cote retrieved a large plastic
               bong, metal grinder, and a sandwich bag containing
               approximately 2 grams of marijuana. Cote and I walked to the
               dumpster where he destroyed his illegal items. I explained the
               student conduct process and told Cote that he was free to go.
