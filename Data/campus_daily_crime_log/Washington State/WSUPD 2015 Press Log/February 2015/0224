               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0906 SYNOPSIS: Report of a possible
               child abuse situation occurring in the lounge of the Vet
               Teaching Hospital. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: Jessica Siple (Vet Teaching Hospital
               employee)reported a possible Child Abuse situation occurring on
               2/23/15 at about 1030 hours in the lounge of the Vet Teaching
               Hospital. Siple said a female, Amy Young, was sitting in the
               lounge with a three to four year old male child. Siple believes
               the child may be Autistic. The child is crying and throwing a
               temper tamper. Siple then said she witnessed Young grabs the
               child's face and rip down the face, as if she was trying to
               tear it off. Young then pushes the child's head against a wall
               divider and holds him there while telling him to stop crying.
               Once Young let go of the child he continued to cry as if in
               pain, and then he started punching himself in the head. A short
               time after that another employee tries to calm the child by
               offering him a piece of candy, but Young stops him saying the
               child did not deserve it. Young then said she deserved the
               candy for having to put up with the child. Siple was asked if
               she observed any injuries or marks on the child that were
               possibly caused by Young's actions. Siple said she did not see
               any injuries or marks on the child. Siple said when she looked
               at Young's face she seem disconnected from the child and did
               not want anything to do with him. Other than her name, Amy
               Young, the only information the Vet Hospital had on Young was
               telephone numbers, 509-999-6667 and 509-954-8005, and an
               address of 2609 West Westover Rd., Spokane, WA. Spokane County
               Sheriff's office was contacted and they are going to check on
               the Child's welfare. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this ____ day of

               check Wright for warrants. Dispatch stated Wright had a warrant
               for 4th degree assault DV from Whitman County. Dispatch
               confirmed the warrant and I placed Wright under arrest for the
               warrant. After speaking with the mother and neighbor Petlovaney
               stated the following to me. He said the Mother stated Wright
               was pounding on her door and shouting but she couldn't tell
               what he was shouting. She turned up the television. The
               neighbor stated she could not tell what Wright was shouting.
               Petlovaney and I could not establish probable cause for a
               domestic violence arrest. I transported Wright to Whitman
               county jail on the warrant arrest. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this ____ day of
               _____________, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 02/24/15 at about 2132 hrs
               Dispatch advised of a subject who wished to speak with an
               officer regarding some items that were stolen from the REC
               center. I responded and contacted the complainant, Michael C.
               Crawford (071796), who told me his cell phone, wallet, and keys
               were stolen from a bench next to the basketball courts. I took
               the initial report and cleared the scene. I later received a
               voice mail from Crawford saying he located his items, which
               someone moved to the other end of the bench. Nothing was
               missing or stolen so the case is unfounded. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 25 day of February, 2015, in Pullman,

               room 417 of Stephenson South. Charges of Possession of
               Marijuana and MIP Possession will be forwarded to the
               prosecutor. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE 1. Tanner D. Salmon

               NARRATIVE: On February 24, 2015 at approximately 2330 hours I
               was dispatched to a drugs call at Stephenson South Hall room
               417. I called the Reporting Party, Brittany Griffin, who is the
               Hall Director on Duty. Griffin stated she was called to
               Stephenson South room 417 by RA's who smelled marijuana. When
               Griffin arrived she smelled the door of room 417 and could
               smell the odor of marijuana. Griffin smelled the surrounding
               doors and determined that the odor of marijuana was only coming
               from room 417. On a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being 100% positive,
               Griffin said she was a 8 out of 10 that the odor she smelled
               was marijuana. On the same scale Griffin stated she was a 9 out
               of 10 that the odor was coming from room 417. Griffin has
               attended 5 controlled marijuana burns with the most recent
               being in August of 2014. Since January 2015 Griffin has called
               in 6 drug calls. Of the 6 calls, 5 have resulted in marijuana
               being present. Griffin provided me with the names of the two
               occupants who live in room 417. Tanner Dane Salmon 01/18/96 and
               Oscar Ivian Deniz-Lucatero 09/21/95 are listed as the occupants
               of room 417. There have been two other prior drug calls at room
               417. On 01/24/15 and 01/29/15 Oscar was contacted for his room
               smelling of marijuana. Both times Oscar told Officers that he
               did not have marijuana and a search was not conducted. Both
               Oscar and Tanner are under the age of 21. I applied and was
               granted a search warrant by Judge Robinson. At approximately
               0040 hours Ofc. Boyd, Ofc. Petlovany, and I served the warrant
               at room 417. Upon arrival I knocked and announced "WSU Police
               Department, search warrant, open your door." Nobody answered. I
               knocked and announced again with no answer. I keyed into the
               room and found nobody inside. I read a copy of the warrant to
               the room and began the search. During the search I determined
               the westside of the room belonged to Oscar and eastside
               belonged to Tanner. During the search I seized the following
               items: Belonging to Oscar: -Indicia -1 small plastic container
               with marijuana residue Belonging to Tanner: -Indicia -1
               unopened 16oz can of Rolling Rock Beer -1 glass pipe with
               marijuana residue -1 sandwich bag of marijuana (0.22 grams) -
               Tin foil with brown residue When the search was complete, I

               left a copy of the search warrant and evidence log in the room
               for Tanner and Oscar. Once back at the station the marijuana
               NIC tested presumptive positive for marijuana. The beer can was
               emptied as Ofc. Boyd witnessed. The empty can was thrown away.
               Charges of MIP Possession and Possession of Marijuana less than
               40 grams will be forwarded to the prosecutor on Tanner.
