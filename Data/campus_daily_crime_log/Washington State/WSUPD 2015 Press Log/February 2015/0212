               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0687 02-12-15 SYNOPSIS: Vehicle with
               door left open behind the Lewis Alumni Center. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 02-12-15 at
               approximately 0705 hours Officer Jones and I were dispatched to
               a vehicle with their door left open in the yellow lot, behind
               the Lewis Alumni Center. Ofc. Jones and I responded and I saw a
               maroon in color Toyota Camry with WA license plate #AND1483
               parked in the yellow lot. The driver's door of the vehicle was
               left open. I called the registered owner of the vehicle,
               Xianming Chen (12-21-56) who came out and spoke with me. Chen
               told me he parked there this morning at 0640 and he locked and
               closed his door. I asked Chen to please go through his vehicle
               to see if anything was missing. Chen told me he has nothing of
               value in his vehicle, but he went through his vehicle for me.
               Chen told me nothing was missing. I asked Chen if it looked
               like anybody had been in his vehicle and he said no. I told
               Chen if he discovers something missing from his vehicle to
               please give me a call. I took photographs of the scene. It's
               possible that Chen's door did not shut completely when he left
               in the morning. It does not appear the vehicle had been
               prowled. No further investigation. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 12th day of
               February, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               Reporting party witnessed a hit and run collision. Both vehicle
               operators were contacted and exchange of information
               facilitated. DRIVER 1: Edward K. Johnson VEHICLE 1: 2013 Dodge
               Ram WA B90303Y DAMAGE: Passenger side front bumper $500 LOCAL
               OPERATOR: Matthew D. Zimmer VEHICLE 2: 2005 Ford Taurus OR
               617BEP DAMAGE: Driver's side rear door and quarter panel $1000
               WITNESS(ES): Marcus W. Blaisdell NARRATIVE: On 02/12/15 at
               approximately 1315 hours I responded to the lobby of WSUPD to
               meet with a subject wanting to report a hit and run collision.
               I met with Marcus Blaisdell in the lobby and he told me the
               following. At approximately 1300 hours he was walking through
               the Green 2 lot south of Daggy Hall. Blaisdell said he saw a
               Dodge Ram (WA B90303Y) pull into a parking stall and strike the
               Ford Focus next to it (to the north). Blaisdell said the
               driver, described as a heavier set, older white male, exited
               his vehicle and left the scene. Blaisdell said he went over to
               the vehicles and noticed damage to the Ford. Blaisdell showed
               me photos of both vehicles to include the damage to the Ford. I
               had Blaisdell email me the photos and I later attached them to
               the case. I responded to the Green 2 lot and located both
               vehicles in the second lane from the east side of the parking
               lot. The vehicles were in the western stalls of the lane both
               facing west and located in the middle of the row. I noticed
               scratches to the Ford on the back driver's side door as well as
               on the driver's side rear quarter panel. I found matching
               scratches to the front passenger side bumper of the Dodge at
               the same height. I photographed the vehicles and later saved
               the photos to the case. I noticed a note on the window of the
               Ford which was from Blaisdell. I was able to speak with Matthew
               Zimmer (local operator of the Ford). I explained to Zimmer what
               happened and told him I would have the other driver contact him
               to exchange information. I told Zimmer to call me if the other
               driver failed to contact him. I contacted the other driver,
               Edward Johnson, on the phone. I explained to Johnson what
               happened. Johnson said he wasn't sure if he hit the other car
               while parking, but noticed it rock when he was parking. Johnson
               said he checked for damage, but did not see any. I told Johnson
               that both vehicles had damage and a witness saw the collision
               occur. I explained to Johnson his responsibilities when
               colliding with another vehicle. I sent an email to both Johnson
               and Zimmer with an exchange of information. I attached the
               email to the case. Both subjects were provided with my contact

               NARRATIVE: On 02-12-15 at approximately 1321 hours WSU Police
               and Pullman Fire were dispatched to a two vehicle injury
               collision on Thatuna at Linden. Officer Jones and I responded
               to the area. We contacted both drivers who said they didn't
               want medical attention. Scott had scrapes on both lower legs
               and had holes in his pants from the collision. Muyuela did not
               have any injuries. Scott was traveling northbound on Thatuna in
               the left lane. Thatuna is a one way street that has two (2)
               lanes of traffic. Scott was changing lanes when his motorcycle
               was struck by the Nissan. Scott said that he was going about 10
               or 20 MPH when a park car pulled out and struck his motorcycle.
               Muyuela was legally parked on Thatuna at a metered space in
               front of the K House. Muyuela was parked on the east side of
               the street. Muyuela said she checked for traffic before she
               pulled out onto Thatuna, but did not see anything. When she
               pulled out the front driver side fender of her vehicle struck
               the motorcycle. She did not see Scott change lanes on the
               motorcycle. The blacktop was dry and the temperature at the
               time was about 56 degrees Farenheit. It was sunny out. Digital
               photos were taken of the vehicles and the scene. Both vehicle
               had been moved prior to our arrival. I exchanged information
               between drivers. Neither vehicle needed a tow. No infractions
               or citations were issued. No further investiagtion. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.

               also said another co-worker left shortly before they did
               through the south double doors. I checked all of the exterior
               doors, they were all locked. I went to the front door with
               Parsons, and he keyed in. He reset the alarm and we exited the
               building. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty

               Student Conduct 2. NARRATIVE: On 02-13-15 at approximately 0057
               hours, I was stopped in the parking lot of Smith Gym watching
               two males who had been climbing the wall of PEB when I observed
               a male stumble passed my location. The male was having a hard
               time walking and as he saw my vehicle, he began to kind of jog,
               but was still stumbling. He was taking up the entire sidewalk
               as he tried to walk and then jog. I pulled out of the parking
               lot to watch him, and as I approached the crosswalk near PEB
               and Bohler Addition, the male suddenly turned and sprinted
               across the street in front of me causing me to slam on my
               brakes. He continued to run down the Regents side of the
               sidewalk. I pulled up next to him and told him to stop, but he
               continued. I continued to follow him in my vehicle and told him
               two more times to stop. Each time he would look at me and
               continue to run. I pulled in front of him a ways, stopped my
               vehicle and got out. I told him "police stop" and he said no
               and continued running towards Northside Residence Hall. I then
               began a foot pursuit of the subject and stated several times,
               "police stop". I could see the male fumbling in his pocket and
               it appeared he was trying to find his Cougar Card so he could
               get into Northside Hall. I continued to chase him and ordered
               him to stop. At some point I activated my body camera. He then
               put his hands in the air and began repeating several times,
               "I'm sorry, I'm sorry". I told him to put his hands behind his
               back and I grabbed a hold of his left wrist. He began to tense
               up and I thought he was going to continue to resist, but he
               stopped as I spun him around and secured both of his hands
               behind his back. At this time I observed an overwhelming odor
               of intoxicants emitting from his breath as he spoke and his
               speech was slurred. He was also swaying as I spoke to him. He
               continued to say, "I'm sorry". I could see looking at him that
               his eyes were bloodshot and appeared watery and sleepy. I
               advised him at this time he was being detained. He was
               handcuffed, the handcuffs were double locked, I removed his
               wallet from his hands, and I had him sit down on a near by
               ledge. I asked him how old he was and he said 19. I asked him
               why he didn't stop when he was told to and he stated he didn't
               hear me. I told him I didn't believe he didn't hear me. I
               advised him he was under arrest for MIP and for Obstructing. I

               removed his WA Driver's License from the wallet, identifying
               him as David K. Abott-Smith/02-04-96. I then advised him of his
               Miranda Warnings from my department issued card. He stated he
               understood them and did not want to answer any questions. I
               searched David and found he was wearing a backpack under his
               sweatshirt. I removed the backpack and it was also searched.
               Inside the bag was a fifth of rum which was 1/4 full which I
               opened and observed it had the odor of intoxicants. Also in the
               bag was a flask which smelled of intoxicants, and a one liter
               bottle of sprite which was 1/2 full and also had the odor of
               intoxicants emitting from it. I placed David in the rear of my
               patrol vehicle while I wrote his citation. When I was finished,
               I explained citation C-8760 to him and advised him I was also
               issuing him a verbal warning for Open Container of Alcohol in
               the City of Pullman. He stated he understood. I removed the
               handcuffs and had him empty all of the containers and dispose
               of the two bottles. I advised him he could keep the metal
               flask. I advised him I would also refer the case to Student
               Conduct and he stated he understood. David was released and I
               watched him enter Northside Residence Hall before I cleared. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 13th day of February, 2015, in Pullman,
