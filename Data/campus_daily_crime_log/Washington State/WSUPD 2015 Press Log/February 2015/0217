    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Boyd/335 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0800 SYNOPSIS: Subjects were warned for
               making inappropriate "cat calls" to women walking in the
               entrance to Northside Cafe. Incident sent to Student Conduct
               and Title IX Coordinator. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR#

               Tapa/062395 Warned Harassment NARRATIVE: On 02/17/15 at about
               2207 hrs Dispatch advised of a female who was reporting a group
               of males in the entryway to Northside Cafe harassing females by
               cat calling and making inappropriate comments. The subjects
               were described as a group of 5 or more black males, one of whom
               had an injured ankle with a scooter. I responded and upon my
               arrival saw two subjects sitting on a couch/bench outside
               Northside Cafe. One of the males, later identified as Kaifa F.
               Tapa (062395) had a cast on one ankle and a scooter. The other
               male was later identified as Calvin R. Green (101195). I asked
               if they knew anything about the cat calling and they denied
               making any comments to anyone walking by. I told them the
               description was fairly good regarding one of the males being
               injured and having a scooter. They continued to deny any
               knowledge of the event. I warned them that if they were making
               such comments toward women as they were walking by it could be
               a form of harassment. I told them the incident would be
               referred to student conduct as well as the university's title
               IX coordinator. I contacted the complainant, Cassidy J. Clark
               (101095), who told me she walked into Northside Cafe to get
               some food and the group of males made several comments about
               her clothing and body as she walked by. They made additional
               comments as she left the cafe. She said the comments made her
               feel uncomfortable so she did not look directly at the subjects
               but knew one of them had an injured ankle and a scooter. I
               asked what exactly they said to her and she said they said
               "Damn Girl", "Nice Ass", and "I love yoga time" (Clark was
               wearing yoga pants at the time). Clark said they made similar
               comments to several other women as they walked by. I told Clark
               I was able to contact and warn two of the subjects and that I
               would be forwarding the incident to student conduct and the
               title IX coordinator. Nothing further. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0805 SYNOPSIS: Report of a subject
               banging on an apartment door at Nez Perce Apartments. Subject
               was contacted and taken into protective custody due to drug
               intoxication. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Tyler V.
               Johnson/123193 Protective Custody 2. NARRATIVE: On 02/18/15 at
               about 0112 hrs Dispatch advised of a female, at apartment B7 of
               Nez Perce Village, was complaining that someone, possibly a
               neighbor, was pounding on her apartment door. She said they
               neighbors have a history of being loud. Officer Westerman and I
               responded. As we approached the building I could hear a male
               behind the building who was yelling very loudly about how he
               could "do anything he wanted". As we walked around the building
               and I could hear him more clearly it sounded as if he was
               intoxicated and I could see him stumbling around on the grass
               behind apartment B7. He walked up to the storage area behind
               apartment B6 and Officer Westerman and I approached him. I
               turned on my flashlight and announced Police Department. The
               male, later identified as Tyler V. Johnson (123193), turned
               around and I instructed him to keep his hands where I could see
               them. He said "just kill me". I began to ask him why he wanted
               us to do that when he began to move toward me. I instructed him
               to stay where he was because he appeared agitated and at that
               time also appeared to be intoxicated by alcohol. Johnson turned
               toward Officer Westerman and made an aggressive movement toward
               him. Officer Westerman pointed his taser at Johnson and said
               "Hey, Put your hands up and turn around". I grabbed Johnsons
               arms and put him in handcuffs. Johnson's arms were tensed up
               and he pushed back against me with his body so I pushed him up
               against the building to prevent him from resisting further. In
               speaking with Johnson and getting closer to him I could not
               smell any odor of intoxicants. Officer Westerman read Johnson
               his constitutional rights and I advised him he was being
               recorded. I had Johnson sit down and tried to ask him what was
               going on. Johnson spoke about being the "singular point of
               everything" and he could do whatever he wanted. He later made
               comments about being "like Jesus" and being God. He also stated
               he "lived 1000 life times" and was "The omega". It was clear by
               Johnson's statements and up and down emotional state he was
               under the influence of some drug. He was unable to answer any
               questions for us. I noticed Johnson had several scratches on
               his hands/face. I asked Officer Petlovany who arrived on scene
               to check with the residents of B7 to see if the window screen,
               which I noticed was on the ground, was damaged by Johnson. They

               said it was not and had previously been damaged. Due to his
               intoxication it was apparent that Johnson was not capable of
               caring for himself. The way he initially acted toward Officer
               Westerman and I indicated he may also be a danger to himself or
               others. We requested Pullman Ambulance respond and transport
               Johnson to PRH. I advised Johnson he was in protective custody.
               Johnson was transported to PRH via Ambulance and the Release of
               Adult Protective Custody form has been added to the case file.
