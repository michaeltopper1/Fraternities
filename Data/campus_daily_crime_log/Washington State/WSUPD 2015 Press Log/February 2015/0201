               mischief that had just occurred on the 5th floor of Northside
               Residence Hall, located at 1590 NE Cougar Way. I arrived on
               scene and proceeded to the 5th floor hallway. I observed
               numerous individuals standing in the hallway and at least one
               overturned chair on the ground. I contacted the complainant,
               who was identified as Colby B. Cavanaugh (DOB 06-07-1994).
               Cavanaugh is the resident advisor for the 5th floor of the
               Northside Residence Hall. I activated my Vievu camera.
               Cavanaugh told me that someone had thrown a chair in the
               hallway, and the chair had hit the wall. The chair had been
               taken from the nearby study lounge and was the property of WSU

               had struck the wall and damaged the wall in two different
               locations. I saw several puncture marks on the surface of the
               wall between rooms #524 and #536. The damage to the wall was
               estimated to be $200.00. I saw that the legs on the overturned
               chair were bent. The damage to the chair is estimated to be
               $200.00. Cavanaugh introduced me to the following individuals
               who were standing in the hallway: Reese M. Duringer (DOB 05-05-
               1995), Joshua P. Johanson (DOB 03-12-1996), and Anastasiia
               Vasiukhina (DOB 09-06-1996). Duringer and Johanson reside at
               Northside Residence Hall #536. Vasiukhina resides at Northside
               Residence Hall #524. I told them that I was recording our
               conversation and directed them to the study lounge so that we
               could talk. As I began speaking with everyone, Johanson and
               Duringer stated that the person responsible for throwing the
               chair in the hallway was their friend, who was later identified
               as Travis T. Clarke (DOB 04-28-1996). indicated that the person
               who was responsible for throwing the chair had returned to the

               stated there was no marijuana in his room. While talking with
               Raupp I found his behavior to be odd. Raupp was answering

               asked him a series of questions. Raupp answered all my
               questions correctly. I asked Raupp several times if he wanted
               medics to come and check on his but Raupp said no. Raupp said
               he is new to smoking marijuana and he just very nervous. I told
               Raupp that he was not allowed to have marijuana on campus and
               because his room smelled of marijuana he would be referred to
               student conduct. Raupp stated he understood. END OF REPORT I

               dispute. Unable to locate. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR#
               1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 02-01-15 at about 2241 hours I was advised
               by Whitcom that PPD was investigating a 911 hang up call.
               Whitcom called the number back and it sounded like a female was
               arguing with somebody. When she was asked by the dispatcher if
               they would be able to tell if there was an emergency, the
               caller stated "no, sorry" and hung up. During a conversation on
               the phone with somebody identified as Erica Wayam, Whitcom
               determined that this incident was possibly occurring at the
               Mariott Hotel. Wayam would not give any specifics about what
               was going on or where exactly they were. Sgt. Jacobsen and I
               went to the Mariott Hotel on N. Fairway. I asked the
               receptionist if they had a room rented to Erica Wayam. He said
               no. I asked if he had seen any females come through the lobby
               that appeared upset and he said no. The receptionist also
               called the Mariott in Moscow, ID and asked if they had a guest
               with that name and they said no. Officer Westerman checked
               several parking lots for a vehicle that is possibly associated
               with Wayam but did not find it. Once I was back at WSUPD I was
               writing my report and could not find "Erica Wayam" in locals,
               like Whitcom had advised she was. I was able to determine the
               subject in question was actually "Erica Rayam". I called the
               Mariott Hotel back and asked if they could check their guest
               list for Erica Rayam. They advised that she was not a
               registered guest at the hotel. Unknown what the problem was or
               where it actually occurred. Unable to locate. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
