               hands. Her pants were ripped. She refused further treatment and
               transport to the hospital by fire personnel. Cpl Kuhrt and I

               1. Nicole H. Sedgwick 02/06/96 Victim 2. Cheyenne Suspect
               NARRATIVE: On 02/13/15 at approximately 1130 hours I was asked
               to follow up on an email that was sent to the general WSU
               Police email. The email was sent on 02/08/15 at 1444 hours and
               was sent to housing as well. The email was from Steve Sedgwick
               and had an attachment of a .PDF file (which was saved to the
               case). The file was a letter that in summary stated his
               daughter Nicole Sedgwick, has been threatened and harassed by
               her old neighbor (Cheyenne) at Regent's Hall. There was no
               specific time frame of the when the threats occurred, but the
               letter stated that Cheyenne was plotting to "commit physical
               violence or abduction" against Nicole. The letter stated that
               Nicole has since been moved from her hall into off campus
               housing. I called Nicole and explained why I was calling. I
               asked Nicole if she was aware of what I was talking about (I
               did not know if her father had told her that he reported it)
               and she said she was. I asked Nicole if I could meet with her
               to talk about the report and she said she was out of town until
               next week. Nicole asked if she could email me to schedule an
               appointment next week and I said she could and provided her
               with my email address. I asked Nicole if she felt safe at this
               time and she said she did and that "the girl was just crazy". I
               sent an email to Steve advising him that his email was received
               (as he requested a reply). Investigation continues. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.

    Narrative: RVWD: AE/330 OFC: Whitman / 323 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY
               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0726 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched
               to a welfare check at Stevens Hall room 309. A mother was
               calling because she had not heard from her daughter since
               September 3rd, and her daughter also missed some appointments
               on campus. Investigation continues. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 02/13/15 at about 1646 I was
               dispatched to a welfare check at Stevens Hall room 309. Cynthia
               K Spiller (091769) called stating she has not heard from her
               daughter since September 3rd. Spiller has called about her
               daughters welfare before. On 12/16/14 I responded to a welfare
               check from Spiller and contacted her daughter, Alanna M.
               Spiller (051298). Alanna was okay and she told me she would
               contact her mother. On 02/13/15 I went to Stevens Hall room 309
               and attempted to contact Alanna. She did not answer the door. I
               heard voice in a adjacent room and knocked on that door. A
               female answered and I asked if she had seen Alanna. She said
               she saw her a couple of days ago. I then went to the floor RA's
               room and knocked, no one answered. I called the RED and she did
               not answer. I then called Karen Fischer from the Dean of
               Students office. She told me Melissa Morgan from their office
               had been in contact with Alanna this semester. There was some
               concern because Alanna's grades had been dropping. Fischer also
               told me that Alanna's RA had contact with her on the evening of
               02/12/15. Due to her not answering and my concern from
               Fischer's comments I decided to check Alanna's room. Corporal
               Daniels and I went to Stevens Hall room 309 and knocked again,
               no one answered. Corporal Daniels keyed into the room. We
               checked the room and Alanna was not present. I secured the door
               and left my business card under the door for Alanna to call me.
               On 02/13/15 at about 2110 hours I talked to the RED for Stevens
               Hall, Christina Gilmore. She said she would have the RA,
               Jessica, make contact with Alanna and call back. Gilmore was
               concerned police contact would cause Alanna undue stress. Given
               the history I agreed. At 2127 hours Gilmore called me back and
               said Jessica had made contact with Alanna and she was okay.
               Gilmore also said they would follow up with there reporting
               process as well so everyone was in the loop about Alanna's
               welfare. I attempted to call Cynthia back twice at her contact
               number and she did not answer. Each time I called the phone
               would ring and then cut off, no voicemail would pick up. I will
               continue to attempt contact with Cynthia Spiller. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               (DOB 03-17-1993) reported a possible citizen dispute outside
               Rogers Hall. Upon further investigation, it was determined to
               be friends yelling at each other. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE

               was dispatched to a report of a citizen dispute outside Rogers
               Hall, located at 1355 SE Olympia Avenue. The complainant,
               Nicholas T. Nguyen (DOB 03-17-1993), reported that 8-10 people
               were in a white pickup near the front entrance of Rogers Hall.
               Nguyen reported the occupants of the pickup were yelling, and
               the driver appeared to be disoriented. Officer Whitman, Officer
               Boyd, and I arrived on scene, and I activated my Vievu camera.
               We contacted a white, 1999 Chevrolet pickup (WA Lic. B08113N)
               near the main entrance to Rogers Hall. The vehicle contained
               about 10 passengers in the bed of the pickup. I contacted the
               driver of the vehicle, who was identified as Hannah L. Pancho
               (DOB 11-11-1995). Upon further investigation, it was determined
               the individuals in the pickup had been yelling at some of their
               friends in Rogers Hall and were waiting for them to come out.
               None of the individuals in the pickup appeared to be
               intoxicated, and Pancho showed no signs of impairment. There
               was no citizen dispute, and no crime had occurred. The original
               report of a citizen dispute was unfounded. Officer Boyd,
               Officer Whitman, and I cleared the scene. The Vievu video was
               downloaded into the permanent digital evidence file. No further
               action at this time. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this __14__ day

               was traveling northbound on Merman Dr near Chief Joseph
               Apartments when I observed vehicle traveling southbound which
               appeared to be traveling in excess of the 25 mph posted speed
               limit. I activated my moving radar unit and observed a reading
               of 36 mph. The vehicle was the only vehicle in the radar field,
               the reading was consistent with my visual observations, and the
               audio tone which was increasing in pitch. The radar was checked
               before and after the stop with the factory issued forks, and
               was found to be in working order. As I turned on the vehicle,
               it pulled into the Terrace Apartment Parking lot off of Merman
               Dr. and stopped. I activated my emergency lights and pulled in
               behind the vehicle. I activated my body camera and contacted
               the driver, advising him the traffic stop was being recorded. I
               later realized my camera did not activate and I activated it
               while running him. I advised him why I was stopping him and he
               stated he understood. I asked him if he had a driver's license
               with him and he stated he had left it at home. He identified
               himself as Adam Mahama/12-23-94. I did a driver's check on Adam
               and was advised by Whitcom his license was suspended 3rd for an
               unpaid ticket. I returned and asked Adam if he was aware his
               license was suspended and he said no. He stated he had recently
               gone to court last fall to take care of a ticket. I advised him
               of the reason for the suspension which was for a different
               ticket he had received. He stated he understood. Adam had a
               young son in the vehicle with him. I advised him I was going to
               issue him a citation and advised him to call to have someone
               come get his vehicle. He stated he would just have us park the
               vehicle and a friend would come pick them up. I returned to my
               vehicle and filled out the citation while we waited for his
               ride. I issued and explained to Adam Criminal Citation #C-08761
               for DWLS 3rd. He stated he would take care of the problem as
               soon as possible. Ofc. Whitman parked his vehicle for him in
               the parking lot of the intramural fields off of Merman. I
               returned his key to him and advised him we were unable to lock
               the door. He stated the door lock was broken and he wasn't
               worried about the vehicle. His ride arrived and I cleared. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 14th day of February, 2015, in Pullman,

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0734 SYNOPSIS: Subjects contacted and
               warned for possession of marijuana and possession of alcohol.
               Incident send to student conduct. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Kassandra A. Pulido/012296 Warned Possession of
               Marij/Alcohol 2. Jasmin Rodriguez/102095 Warned Possession of
               Marij/Alcohol NARRATIVE: On 02/13/15 at about 2332 hrs Dispatch
               advised hall staff at Stevens Hall was reporting the odor of
               marijuana coming from room 306. I responded and confirmed the
               odor of marijuana was coming from room 306. I knocked on the
               door several times with no response, the lights were off so
               initially I assumed no one was home. Hall staff then advised
               they had heard subjects in the room earlier and never saw
               anyone leave. I knocked on the door again and advised I knew
               they were inside so they might as well come out. Two females
               answered the door, later identified as Jasmin Rodriguez
               (102095) and Kassandra A. Pulido (012296). I asked why they
               didn't answer the door the many times I knocked previously.
               They said they were just hanging out. I told them I believed
               they were hiding because their room smelled like marijuana. The
               odor was overwhelming with the door open and was obviously
               coming from room 306. I told them they had two options, they
               could retrieve all their illegal items and we would dispose of
               them outside and I would send the incident to student conduct.
               I told them the other option was I could seize their room and
               they would be free to go while I applied for a search warrant,
               which the judge may or may not grant. I told them should the
               search warrant be granted I would search the room and anything
               found would be dealt with through student conduct and the court
               system. They chose to retrieve their items. They brought out a
               small jar containing a trace amount of marijuana. They admitted
               they smoked everything they had. They also had two small glass
               pipes and a half gallon bottle of vodka that was 1/3 full. I
               walked outside with them and observed them dispose of all the
               items. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 14 day of February,
               2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0735 SYNOPSIS: Subject was arrested,
               cited, and released for DWLS 3rd degree. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Brenton J. Williams-Mcbride
               Cited/Release DWLS 3rd 5Z0198049 2. NARRATIVE: On 02/14/15 at
               about 0144 hrs I was driving Northbound on Stadium Way near NE
               Lybecker Rd. when I noticed a vehicle that was driving
               Southbound on Stadium Way. The vehicle caught my attention
               because it did not have any functioning tail lights. I turned
               around and initiated a traffic stop on the vehicle, turning on
               my overhead lights. The vehicle stopped on Gaines Rd. just off
               Orchard Dr. I contacted the driver, Brenton J. Williams-Mcbride
               (071790), and told him the reason for the stop and the stop was
               being recorded. I asked for his driver's license, vehicle
               registration, and proof of insurance. He provided the
               registration and a Michigan ID card. I ran his information
               through Dispatch, who advised Williams-Mcbride's driving status
               in Washington was DWLS 3rd degree. I returned to the vehicle
               and had Williams-Mcbride step out. I advised him his driving
               status in Washington was suspended and that he was under arrest
               for DWLS 3rd degree. I placed him in handcuffs (double locked)
               and read him his Constitutional Rights from a pre-printed card.
               He stated he understood his rights and verbally waived them.
               Williams-Mcbride told me his ID was stolen previously and he
               thought one of his friends or someone must have been using his
               ID. I checked with Dispatch and they advised the suspension was
               due to an unpaid ticket for no proof of insurance in March of
               2013. Williams-Mcbride stated he never received a ticket. I
               told him I had no way to proof that at the time so I would be
               issuing him the citation for DWLS 3rd degree and he would have
               to try and argue his case in court. I issued him citation
               #5Z0198049 for DWLS 3rd degree. I explained the citation to
               him, he received his copy, and was released. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
