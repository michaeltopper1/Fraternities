               CITE/SECTOR# 1.Vadim P. Turlak (090791) Protective Custody
               Suicidal 2. NARRATIVE: On 020215 at approximately 1056 hours, I
               was dispatched to a report of a citizen assist at WSU
               Counseling Services. Upon arrival, I contacted Nikki J. Stypa
               who told me the following. Vadim P. Turlak was a patient of
               hers and she has concerns for his safety. Stypa stated that he
               came to her office for a counseling appointment and he told her
               that on Saturday night (013115) he had serious thoughts of
               committing suicide. She stated that she worked up a safety plan
               with Turlak and he told her that he couldn't commit to not
               hurting himself between today and his next appointment. She
               stated that he wanted to go to the hospital voluntarily to see
               a mental health professional. I spoke with Turlak and asked him
               if he had a plan on how he would kill himself. He told me that
               he would either use a knife from his kitchen, jump in front of
               a bus, or jump off Palouse Falls. I asked him if he wanted to
               hurt himself today and he told me that he didn't at the moment,
               but when he is alone, he cannot control his thoughts. He also
               stated that he has been reluctant to call for help in the past.
               I told Turlak that he was being placed in protective custody
               and that I appreciate that he is willing to go voluntarily. I
               asked him if I could search is pockets and he told me I could.
               I had him turn around and interlock his hands behind his back
               while I searched him. I transported Turlak to Pullman Regional
               Hospital for an Involuntary Treatment Act hold on him. At the
               hospital, I completed the protective custody paperwork and the
               doctor signed the form receiving Turlak for treatment. I
               cleared shortly after. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 2nd day of February,

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: JAK/333 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0504 SYNOPSIS: I received a phone call
               from a WSU employee who was concerned for one of his co-
               workers. I made phone contact with the co-worker who said her
               ex-boyfriend was taking their recent break up hard. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 02-02-15, I
               contacted Christina M. McGilvray (12-04-88) via telephone and
               asked her if she could tell me what was going on. Said she had
               ended a relationship she had with Grady L. Penturf (02-06-87)
               over the weekend. On 02-02-15, at approximately 1500 hours,
               McGilvray was driving from her apartment in Moscow to come to
               Pullman. When she was nearing the intersection of the Pullman-
               Moscow Highway and Airport Way, she noticed a red Honda Civic
               change lanes behind her. The Civic then pulled up beside her
               and began honking it's horn. She realized the driver of the
               Civic was her ex-boy friend, Grady L. Penturf. McGilvray pulled
               over into an unidentified parking lot and had a brief
               conversation with Penturf. She told him if he wanted to talk
               they had to go back to her apartment in Moscow. At
               approximately 1515 hours, they returned to her apartment and
               talked until approximately 2000 hours, when she asked him to
               leav. She said his emotional state was all over the place. One
               minute he would be manic and the next he would make suicidal
               comments. Penturf said he was going to drive back to LaGrand,
               Oregon. McGilvray said her parents drove by Penturf's house
               (10305 S. Mcallister in LaGrand, Or.) on 02-02-15 and they did
               not see his red Honda Civic. McGilvray said she became
               concerned Penturf may not have driven back to Oregon and may
               stay in the area to try to "Win her back". She said she did not
               feel like he would not hurt her or anyone else. She said; if
               anything, she felt he may cause a scene by yelling, hoping she
               would then take him back. She said she did not want Law
               Enforcement contacting Penturf unless he did actually did
               something. I have asked McGilvray to e-mail me a detailed
               statement as to what occurred over the weekend break up. More
               to follow. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 2nd day of February, 2015, in Pullman,

               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 02/02/15 at
               approximately 2350 hours I was dispatched to a parking problem
               at Perham Hall. Dispatch stated there was a black Honda
               Ridgeline truck parked next to the dumpsters in a no parking
               zone. Upon arrival I found the truck as described. The truck
               was parked on a access driveway that lead to the dumpsters. The
               intent of the driveway is to provide a paved path for the
               garbage trucks to drive on. I walked around the area and found
               no signs that regulated the driveway. Since there was nothing
               posted prohibiting parking, there was not an enforcement action
               I could take. As I was about to clear a female walked up to the
               truck and said she was parked there to unload her groceries and
               was going to move it right now. I told the female, who was not
               identified, that it would be best not to park there in the
               future. END OF REPORT I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 3rd day of February,
               2015, in Pullman, Washington.
