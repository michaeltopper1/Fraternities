    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: JAK/333 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0771 SYNOPSIS: Han M. Quach called
               Whitcom asking for an Officer to escort him to the WSU Office
               of Student Standards and Accountability and the Office of the
               Registrar. Quach is currently trespassed from the University. I
               contacted Quach via telephone. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 02-16-15, at approximately
               0817 hours, Han M. Quach (12-15-90) called Whitcom asking for
               an Officer to escort him to the WSU Office of Student Standards
               and Accountability and the Office of the Registrar. Quach is
               currently trespassed from the University. At approximately 0829
               hours, I tried contacted Quach via telephone (253-278-2520).
               After several rings I received a message stating "I'm sorry,
               but the person you called has a voice mail box that has not
               been set up yet". At approximately 0906 hours, Whitcom advised
               Quach had called them again asking to speak with an Officer. I
               called him again and was able to speak with him. I asked him
               where he needed to go and what he needed to accomplish. He said
               he needed to go to the Student Conduct because he did not
               comply with some of their sanctions. He said they put a "Hold"
               on his transcripts and he needed to ask them what he could do
               in order to have the "Hold" lifted. He said he then needed to
               go to the Office of the Registrar. I asked him if he had called
               either of the offices to see what he needed to do and he said
               he had not. I advised him he needed to contact both offices to
               see what he needed to do before calling us again for an escort.
               As of 1520 hours, on 02-16-15, I have not heard back from
               Quach. Nothing further at this time. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0775 SYNOPSIS: Benjamin P. Johnson
               called Whitcom stating his bicycle was stolen sometime after
               1700 hours on 02-15-15. He said he had it locked to the bike
               rack at Scott Hall. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 02-16-15, at approximately 1248 hours, Benjamin
               P. Johnson (12-12-95) called Whitcom stating his bicycle had
               been stolen. I was asked by Whitcom to contact Johnson via
               telephone at (360) 296-0111. At approximately 1250 hours, I
               called Johnson and he asked if he could call me back in a few
               minutes as it was very loud where he was. He called me back
               several minutes later and I asked what I could do for him. He
               told me he locked his bicycle up in the bike rack; located
               outside of Scott Hall, at approximately 1700 hours on 02-15-15.
               He said he went out to unlock and ride his bike at
               approximately 0900 hours on 02-16-15 and it was not there. He
               described his bicycle as being neon green in color and having
               tires that had yellow sidewalls. He said it was a fixed gear
               bicycle with a straight handle bar. He said it had fly fishing
               stickers on the frame of the bike and a blue string tied to the
               seat. He could not remember the brand of the bicycle, but said
               it was made in Bellevue. He believed there was a sticker on the
               bike that read Bellevue, but he was not sure. He said he paid
               approximately $150.00 for the bike in June of 2014. He told me
               he had locked up the front tire to the bike rack. He said the
               front tire was still locked to the rack. Someone had opened the
               quick release mechanism of his axle and taken the bicycle. He
               said he has no idea who may have stolen his bicycle. Nothing
               further at this time. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 16th day of February,

               floor where RA's had found the fire escape diagram had been
               ripped off the wall. The diagram had been attached to the wall
               with glue. Upon arrival I found the wall damaged outside of
               room 726. Some of the wall plaster had been ripped off when the
               diagram was taken. There was several small pieces of plaster on
               the ground underneath the damage. It was clear that the diagram
               had been ripped off very recently. The RA's who found the
               damage had already left the scene and did not require contact.
               Photos of the damage were taken and uploaded to the files
               folder. The damage to the wall is estimated at $50 dollars. END

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: BRW/325 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0782 SYNOPSIS: Subject was cited and
               released for possession of a fake ID. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Victoria L. Ramirez 03/26/96 Cited/Released
               Poss. Fake ID 5Z0305856 2. NARRATIVE: On 02/17/15 at
               approximately 0530 hours I was sitting on the access road next
               to Wagner Hall monitoring traffic when I noticed an orange VW
               Beetle heading southbound on Stadium Way near Grimes Way. The
               Beetle appeared to be traveling faster than the posted 20 MPH
               zone. I activated my handheld radar (Decatur Scout 2013) and
               obtained a reading of 33 MPH. When the Beetle passed my
               location I pulled behind it and imitated a traffic stop. I
               contacted the driver, Victoria Lynn Ramirez 03/26/96,
               identified myself, informed Ramirez that I was recording, and
               explained the reason for the stop. I asked Ramirez for her
               driver's license and she stated it was in her purse in the
               trunk. Ramirez asked if I wanted her to get it from the trunk
               and I told her yes. Ramirez removed a clutch style wallet from
               her purse. Ramirez was facing me as she looked for her ID. I
               watched as Ramirez pulled up a license and placed it in another
               slot in the wallet. Ramirez then grabbed another license and
               handed it to me. Ramirez provided me with her WADL. I asked
               Ramirez what the other ID she passed over was. Ramirez stated
               it was her old license. I asked Ramirez if I could see the
               license and Ramirez handed me the second Driver's License. The
               second driver's license was a Montana Driver's License with
               Ramirez's picture on it. The license had the name and date of
               birth of, Victoria L. Ramirez 02/26/93. The Montana license
               would make Ramirez 21 years old. I told Ramirez to sit in her
               car which she did. I ran both license through dispatch.
               Dispatch stated the WADL returned clear and current. The MTDL
               had no record. It was clear that the Montana Driver's License
               was fake. I filled out a Sector citation for RCW 46.20.0921.1A
               possession of a fraudulent driver's license. I returned to
               Ramirez and told her that she was being charged with possession
               of a fake ID and explained the Sector citation. Ramirez was
               provided with her copy and told she was free to go. END OF
               REPORT I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the
               laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 17th day of February, 2015, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer
