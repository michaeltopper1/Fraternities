    Narrative: RVWD: AE/330 OFC: Whitman / 323 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY
               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W0880 SYNOPSIS: Responded to a
               burglary alarm at the Student Recreation Center. Contacted
               three females inside who were setting up for a climbing wall
               competition later in the day. Employee error. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 02/22/15 at about 0803
               hours we were dispatched to a burglary alarm at the Student
               Recreation Center. The alarmed showed an alarm activation at
               the front door. Officer Kirshner and I responded to the SRC. We
               checked the perimeter and then entered to conduct a building
               search. Once inside we heard what sounded like a vacuum cleaner
               and some voices. We again announced "Police show yourself" and
               a female voice answered from the north side of the building
               near the climbing wall. The female came out from behind the
               curtain that divides the courts. There were three females in
               total and they said they were setting up for a climbing
               competition at the climbing wall. Their boss had let them in
               the front door and then gone over to the ORC to make some
               copies. I asked all three females for identification. They were
               identified as Katelyn A. Spradley (030690), Ava F. King
               (090293), and Tara M. Beyerlin (121091). Officer Kirshner asked
               what their boss's name was and they said Matthew S. Wagner
               (032684) he also asked if they could call their boss so he
               could talk to him. Officer Kirshner talked to Wagner who said
               there was a maintenance working in the SRC when he arrived to
               let in the three females. He believed that somehow between the
               maintenance man leaving and their entering the alarm was set
               off. As I was leaving through the front of the building Wagner
               had come back and I spoke to him briefly and confirmed what he
               told Officer Kirshner over the phone. He reset the alarm and we
               cleared the scene. Employee error. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 22nd day of
               February, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               between two WSU students. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR#
               1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 02-22-15, at approximately 1153 hours,
               Sarah J. Cundiff (07-01-94) called Whitcom stating she
               overheard a WSU student talking about possibly being thrown to
               the ground by her boyfriend. Cundiff is the Resident Advisor
               for the 2nd floor of the NorthSide Residence Hall. She said she
               overheard Sarah C. Essary (05-18-96) and her boyfriend, Shawn
               M. Reilly (02-14-96) arguing in the 2nd floor hallway. She said
               she thought she heard Essary say something about being thrown
               to the ground by Reilly. She said they entered suite 282 and
               said Essary's brother, Christopher W. Essary (05-18-96), is a
               resident in room 282A. I asked Cundiff if Essary and Reilly
               were still in suite 282 and she said she believed they were as
               she had not heard the door open or shut after calling Whitcom.
               Officer Olmstead and I responded to the Northside Residence
               Hall and met the "On Call" Residential Educational Director,
               Charles A. Beckers (07-17-86), in the lobby. We walked to the
               second floor where we contacted Cundiff. She verified
               everything she had relayed to Whitcom so Officer Olmstead and I
               went to suite 282 and knocked on the door. Eventually,
               Christopher Reilly answered the door. He allowed us into the
               Suite where Officer Olmstead performed a security sweep of the
               area. I asked Christopher if his sister and boyfriend were
               there and he said they left less than 5 minutes ago. He said
               they were having a verbal argument and he heard his sister say
               something about being thrown to the ground by Reilly. He said
               he "Got in Reilly's face" and told him that was not cool and
               not to do it again. He said Reilly never admitted to having
               thrown his sister to the ground. Reilly and Sarah continued
               verbally arguing so Christopher told them they had to leave. I
               left my business card with Christopher and asked him to tell
               his sister she needed to call me. I also asked Christopher to
               call me if she came back. Officer Olmstead and I responded to
               Sarah's room (Northside Hall, room 314), knocked on the door,
               and received no answer. Cundiff said the lobby desk attendant,
               Monica A. Hall (04-24-96), was Sarah Essary's roommate. I

               hours WSU Interns on foot patrol witnessed someone throw a beer
               can out of a window of Scott Hall. Officer Westerman and I
               responded to Scott Hall and talked to WSU Interns Cody-Berry,
               and York. We determined the can came from the third floor third
               room from the south side of Scott Hall. We went to the third
               floor and I knocked on the door to room 303. Benjamin Ruiz III
               (092095) answered the door. I asked if he would come out into
               the hall and talk to me, he said he would and came out into the
               hallway. I asked him if there was anyone else in the room. At
               first he said there was no one else but then changed his
               statement and said there was others in the room. Officer
               Westerman asked Ruiz to ask if everyone would come out and we
               could talk to them. Two other males, Dylan M. Greninger
               (082495) and Owen K. Olsen (112195), stepped out into the
               hallway. I asked if they knew why we were there, they said they
               did not know. I asked if they had been drinking alcohol this
               evening and they said they had earlier off campus. I asked if
               they had identification I could look at, they said they did not
               but gave me their names and dates of birth. I ran all three
               through dispatch. I asked if there was any alcohol in the room
               and they said there was not. Officer Westerman asked who lived
               in the room and they all said that it was a friend of theirs
               and she was not in the room. They said the resident of the
               room, Payton A. Roberts (031796), had just left. Officer
               Westerman asked if they could call her and have her come back
               to the room. Olsen called her and she returned to the room.
               Ruiz admitted there was alcohol in the room and said it was
               his. He also said he was the one who threw the beer can out of
               the window. Officer Westerman explained that they could gather
               the alcohol from the room and dispose of it and I would forward
               the report to student conduct or we could apply for a search
               warrant and if granted it may lead to criminal charges as well
               as the report going to student conduct. All four said they

               would gather the alcohol and dispose of it. They gathered
               approximately 10 to 12 cans of beer from the room. They took
               them down to the mop closet at the end of the hall and I
               observed as they emptied them into a utility sink. We cleared
               the scene. Forward to student conduct. I certify and declare

               released for DWLS 2nd Degree. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Jordan J. Bakken 12/24/90 Cited/Released DWLS
               2nd 5Z0305858 2. NARRATIVE: On 02/22/15 at approximately 2219
               hours I was driving eastbound on Valley Road near the Valley
               View Apartments when I noticed a black Kia Spectra heading
               westbound on Valley Road heading towards me. The Kia appeared
               to be traveling faster than the posted 25 MPH zone. I activated
               my in car radar (vehicle 4) and obtained a reading of 40 MPH.
               As soon as the car passed me I turned around and initiated a
               traffic stop. I contacted the driver, Jordan Joseph Bakken
               12/24/90, identified myself, informed Bakken I was recording,
               and explained the reason for the stop. Bakken provided me with
               his WADL and vehicle registration. I returned to my patrol car
               and ran Bakken through dispatch. Dispatch stated that Bakken
               was suspended in the 2nd degree through Washington for refusing
               to provide a breath sample after an DUI arrest. About this time
               Ofc. Whitman arrived on scene. I recontacted Bakken and asked
               him to speak with me outside of the car. I told Bakken that his
               driver's license was suspended from a DUI. Bakken stated that
               he thought his license was fine since his lawyer had told him
               so. I told Bakken that the DOL shows his license as suspended.
               I told Bakken that he was under arrest for DWLS 2nd Degree and
               handcuffed (D/L) him. I told Bakken that he was being audio and
               video recorded and read him his Miranda Rights of my department
               issued card. Bakken was searched incident to arrest and one
               pocket knife was removed. Bakken stated that he wished his
               passenger, later identified as Megan Lynn Frohlich 06/13/93, to
               drive his car to the Police Station while he was being
               processed. I spoke with Frohlich who provided her WADL.
               Frohlich's driving status was clear. I transported Bakken to
               the Pullman Holding Facility where he was fingerprinted and
               photographed. I issued Bakken a Sector citation for RCW
               46.20.342.1B Driving While License Suspended in the 2nd Degree.
               I explained the citation to Bakken and provided him with his
               copy. Bakken was released from custody and I cleared. END OF
               REPORT I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the
               laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 23rd day of February, 2015, in Pullman,

               heard paramedics being dispatched to Rogers Hall for a
               sickness. Whitcom advised that a male in room 231 was feeling
               sick, like he might be having an anxiety attack. I responded
               and contacted the residents of room 231. One male resident said
               he did not feel good and he thought he might be having an
               anxiety attack. I could see he was shaking but no other
               physical signs of any problems. I talked with the subject while
               we waited for medics to arrive. Once they arrived he asked them
               to take his vitals and I left. I did not identify the subject
               or his roommate. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury

               is true and correct. Dated this 23rd day of February, 2015, in
