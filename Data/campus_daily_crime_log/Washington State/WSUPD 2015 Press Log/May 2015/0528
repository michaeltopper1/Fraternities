               roof. Sgt. Macy and I responded from the office. We arrived and
               Sgt. Macy and Cpl. Edwards watched the southeast side of the
               building where there is a low roof people use to gain access to
               the roof. I entered Kimbrough Hall and accessed the roof. I

               they did. They also had beer and wine with them. There was two
               open beer cans, several closed cans and a wine bottle. Surber

               alcohol and they all said they had. The three minors stated
               they drank alcohol earlier at a party at DU's, and did not
               drink any of the alcohol that Surber had with him. I explained
