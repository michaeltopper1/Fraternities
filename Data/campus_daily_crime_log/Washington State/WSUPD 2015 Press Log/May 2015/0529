    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Olmstead/339 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2550 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched to a
               report of an individual who had threatened a coworker and
               damaged a chair in Fulmer Hall. Criminal charges will be
               forwarded to the Whitman County Prosecuting Attorney's Office.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Aaron M. Stuteville /
               05-30-1990 Charges Forwarded Malicious Mischief and Disorderly
               Conduct 2. NARRATIVE: On 05-29-2015 at about 1108 hrs I was
               dispatched to report of a possible assault in progress on the
               3rd floor of Fulmer Hall. Dispatch advised that the suspect was
               described as a heavy set male with a beard and wearing shorts.
               Officer Stewart and I arrived on scene and contacted an
               individual in the 3rd floor hallway of Fulmer Hall who matched
               the description of the suspect. The male was identified as
               Aaron M. Stuteville (DOB 05-30-1990). Stuteville is a graduate
               student and time slip employee for the WSU Chemistry
               Department. Officer Stewart remained with Stuteville and
               questioned him about the incident. For more information, see
               Officer Stewart's supplemental narrative. I walked further down
               the hallway and began contacting witnesses. I contacted Ryan W.
               Rice (DOB 08-06-1980), Nicki R. Clark (DOB 02-28-1970), and
               Robert L. Jackson (DOB 09-20-1952). Rice is the laboratory
               supervisor for the general chemistry laboratories and is
               Stuteville's supervisor. Clark is the academic coordinator for
               the Chemistry Department, and Jackson is the stockroom manager.
               Rice stated that at about 1100 hrs he was upstairs and was
               contacted by Jackson. Jackson told him that Stuteville was in
               the 3rd floor hallway yelling. Rice went to the hallway and
               observed Stuteville walking towards him. Rice described
               Stuteville as being visibly angry and muttering something like,
               "that asshole". Rice took Stuteville into his office (Fulmer
               Hall #309) and spoke with him. Stuteville told Rice that he was
               upset with Jackson because Jackson had told him he was wasting
               his time inventorying the laboratory equipment. Stuteville told
               Rice that Jackson was consistently rude to him and asked if
               anyone at the university cared. Rice said Stuteville was pacing
               back and forth in his office and was yelling. Stuteville stated
               that he was done working at the university. Rice described
               Stuteville's voice as loud enough to draw the attention of
               others walking past his office in the hallway. While in his
               office, Rice said Stuteville punched the side of the file
               cabinet and picked up a chair and slammed it into the floor.
               Rice said some of the wheels on the chair popped off when the
               chair struck the floor. Rice said Stuteville then stated

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
               something like, "I want to kill him" or "I'm going to kill
               him". Rice believed Stuteville was referring to wanting to kill
               Jackson. Rice said Stuteville then walked out of his office. I
               spoke with Clark. Clark said she heard yelling in the hallway
               and went to investigate. She saw Stuteville yelling obscenities
               at Jackson, and he appeared to be irate. Clark said she thought
               Stuteville was going to hit Jackson. Clark said she told
               Stuteville to come to her office and urged him to calm down.
               Clark said Stuteville walked away down the hallway but
               continued to yell at Jackson. Clark said Stuteville's face was
               pale, and she was concerned for his health. Clark returned to
               her office and then heard yelling and a loud crash. Clark found
               Stuteville yelling in Rice's office, and Rice motioned for her
               to call. Clark said she contacted another coworker and then
               called the police. I spoke with Jackson. Jackson said earlier
               today he was working in a laboratory (Fulmer #320) and observed
               Stuteville in the room. Jackson said he spoke with Stuteville
               and learned that Stuteville was rearranging laboratory
               equipment for Rice. Jackson said he told Stuteville he was
               wasting his time because he was going to do the same thing
               later this summer. Jackson said he noticed that Stuteville
               seemed to be agitated and was breathing hard. A few minutes
               later, Jackson said he was in the hallway and noticed
               Stuteville walking towards him. Jackson described Stuteville as
               "breathing hard like a bull blowing". Jackson said Stuteville
               yelled at him and approached to within inches of his face with
               his hands formed into fists. Jackson stated that Stuteville was
               screaming at him and accused him of being an "asshole" today
               and on many previous occasions. Jackson turned away from
               Stuteville and went to find Rice. Jackson said he found Rice
               and told him what had happened. Jackson accompanied Rice to the
               3rd floor and saw Rice take Stuteville into his office. Jackson
               said several minutes later he saw Stuteville in the hallway
               again. Jackson said that Stuteville stated, "just keep walking
               mother fucker". Jackson said he entered a nearby room and did
               not say anything to Stuteville. I explained to Jackson that
               when Stuteville was in Rice's office, he stated that he wanted
               to kill him (Jackson). I asked Jackson how he felt about that.
               Jackson said he felt "sad" for Stuteville and told me that it
               was probably just a "heat of the moment thing". Jackson
               explained that he could see how someone else might be
               intimidated by Stuteville's behavior and told me that he was
               not intimidated by Stuteville. I conferred with Officer Stewart
               who was speaking with Stuteville. I told Officer Stewart about
               the threat towards Jackson and the damaged chair. Stuteville
               approached us and said he had overheard some of my conversation
               with Officer Stewart. Stuteville said he wanted to be honest
               and had forgotten about that outburst. Stuteville said he had
               no intention of hurting Jackson. Stuteville said he was dying
               and was referring to his diagnosis with Multiple Sclerosis.
               Stuteville said he would never hurt anyone and referred to
               himself as a "wus". I asked Stuteville if he damaged the chair
               in Rice's office. Stuteville admitted to slamming the chair on
               the ground. Stuteville said some of the wheels came off the
               chair when he slammed it, but he was not sure if the chair was

               broken. Stuteville said he would pay for the chair if it was
               damaged. I asked Stuteville if he threatened to kill Jackson
               when he was in Rice's office. Stuteville admitted that he
               stated, "I want to kill him". I asked Stuteville why he said
               that and what he meant by that statement. Stuteville said he
               had no idea why he said that. Stuteville said he had never said
               anything like that before. I asked Stuteville if he was
               referring to Jackson in his threatening statement, and
               Stuteville admitted that he was. Stuteville said he would
               "never hurt that man". Stuteville went on to say that he was
               not even sure if he meant Jackson and stated he was just
               "angry". I left Stuteville with Officer Stewart. I consulted
               with the Whitman County Prosecuting Attorney's Office on the
               telephone. After discussing the facts of the investigation, I
               decided not to arrest Stuteville for Harassment. I decided to
               forward the case to the Prosecuting Attorney's Office
               requesting Stuteville be charged with Malicious Mischief and
               Disorderly Conduct. I accompanied Rice to his office and
               checked the file cabinet. The file cabinet did not appear to be
               damaged. I saw that a chair was overturned in the office, and
               Rice told me that was the chair Stuteville had slammed into the
               floor. The wheels from the legs of the chair were detached from
               the chair and on the ground. I replaced the wheels onto the
               legs of the chair and determined that they were not damaged.
               However, I determined that one of the metal legs on the chair
               was bent. Rice said he had recently used the chair yesterday,
               and it had not been damaged. Rice said he believed the leg on
               the chair had been damaged as a result of Stuteville slamming
               it forcefully into the floor. The chair was identified as a
               "Steelcase" brand and was the property of the Chemistry
               Department. The value of the chair was estimated to be $100.00.
               Officer Stewart later photographed the chair and the damaged
               leg. The photographs were downloaded into Spillman and attached
               to this case. I returned to Stuteville, who was waiting with
               Officer Stewart in the hallway. I counseled Stuteville about
               his behavior and warned him that it was never appropriate to
               threaten another person. I explained to Stuteville that
               threatening statements could be considered a criminal offense,
               depending upon the specific situation and how they are
               received. I told Stuteville that he would not be arrested
               today. I told Stuteville that I would forward my case to the
               Whitman County Prosecuting Attorney's Office for review and
               possible criminal charges. Stuteville had mentioned earlier
               that he was suffering from Multiple Sclerosis and had some
               health problems. I asked Stuteville if he needed medical
               attention, but he declined any medical treatment and said it
               was not necessary. I instructed Stuteville to leave Fulmer Hall
               and go home for the weekend so he could relax and cool off. I
               told him that his supervisor would contact him with
               instructions on when to return to work. Stuteville agreed to do
               this. Officer Stewart spoke with Stuteville about the benefits
               of seeking assistance through WSU Counseling Services.
               Stuteville did not meet the criteria to be taken into
               protective custody. Stuteville was released and left the
               building. Rice, Clark, and Jackson provided written statements.
