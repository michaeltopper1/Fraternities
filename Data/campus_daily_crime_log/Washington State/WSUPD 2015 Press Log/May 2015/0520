    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: DBT/321 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2470 SYNOPSIS: Report of a stray dog in
               the area of Johnson Hall. Officers responded and were able to
               locate the dog. The dog was released to their owner. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 05-20-15 at
               approximately 0815 I was dispatched to the report of large,
               black dog with a chain collar running around the area of Wilson
               Rd. and Stadium Way. Dispatch advised the dog was last seen
               heading towards Johnson Hall on Wilson Rd. I responded to the
               area. I drove around Wilson Rd. and could not locate the dog. I
               continued to drive around the area, and I finally saw the dog
               outside of Ferdinand's. I got out of my patrol vehicle and
               tried to follow the dog, but every time I got close, the dog
               ran away. I continued to follow the dog to Bailey Brayton
               Field. Sgt. Jacobson arrived on scene to assist me with
               catching the dog. The dog ran behind the indoor baseball
               practice facility. I was finally able to get ahold of the dog's
               chain collar. The name tag on the collar said "Hank" and it had
               a phone number listed. I tried calling the number, but there
               was no answer and the voicemail box was not setup. A few
               minutes later the owner called back. The owner was later
               identified as Layne R. Bruner (DOB 09-24-94). I told Bruner we
               had Hank and asked where we could meet him. Bruner said he
               could meet us in front of Bohler Gym. Sgt. Jacobson and I
               transported Hank to Bohler Gym and returned him to Bruner.
               Bruner thanked us and said one of his roommates left the door
               open to their apartment and he Hank got out. Sgt. Jacobson and
               I cleared the scene. No further action. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               20th day of May, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               at WSU University Stores, building found unsecured. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On May 20, 2015 at
               about 1928 hours WSU Police were toned out to a burglary alarm
               at University Stores. The southwest entry door was the zone in
               alarm. Cpl. Edwards and I responded to the building. I found
               the southwest door locked but not fully shut. Cpl. Edwards and
               I searched the building. Nobody was found inside and nothing
               appeared to be out of the ordinary. We secured the building and
               reset the alarm. I left a voicemail message for Wade Bantner,
               Transportation Supervisor WSU University Stores. No further
               investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 20th day of May, 2015, in
               Pullman, Washington. _______________________________________
