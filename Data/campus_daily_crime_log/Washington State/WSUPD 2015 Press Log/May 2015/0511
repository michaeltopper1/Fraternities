               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2340 SYNOPSIS: Student threatened his
               professor. Student was arrested for harassment and was booked
               into the Whitman County Jail. Charges will be forwarded on him
               for harassment. WSU Student Conduct will be notified as well.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Kalid A. Mahammed/05-
               15-86 Booked/Charges Forwarded Harassment 2. NARRATIVE: On 05-
               11-15 at approximately 1119 hours I was dispatched to the
               report of threatening, located at 1320 East College Ave, Fulmer
               Hall #414. Dispatch advised a student just threatened a
               professor and Teacher Assistant's over being accused of
               cheating. Ofc. Welter and I arrived on scene. We contacted the
               complainant, Gregory J. Crouch (DOB 09-11-59), in his office.
               Crouch told us he is a Chemistry Professor at WSU. Jeffrey P.
               Joswig-Jones (DOB 12-29-58) was also in the office and told us
               he is a Professor at WSU and witnessed what had happened. I
               asked Crouch to tell me what happened. Crouch told me he was
               having an academic integrity meeting with his student, Kalid A.
               Mahammed (DOB 05-15-86), about accusations of cheating on a
               Chemistry Exam on 05-04-15. Crouch is Mahammed's Professor for
               Chemistry 345. Crouch told us this is Mahammed's third
               violation of academic integrity at the university, and the
               second time he has had to deal with him. Crouch told me Joswig-
               Jones was sitting in on the meeting between him and Mahammed.
               Crouch said at the end of the meeting Mahammed commented that
               he knew where he lived. Crouch also said Mahammed said he would
               "be on them like ISIS". Crouch said after the ISIS comment was
               made Mahammed started muttering something in Arabic that he
               could not understand. Crouch said Mahammed knows where he
               lives, and he appeared to be nervous. Joswig-Jones told me he
               felt the need to have his classroom door locked after sitting
               in on the meeting. Joswig-Jones said he felt threatened just
               being there and hearing what Mahammed said. I asked Crouch if
               he felt threatened, and he said yes. Ofc. Welter and I told
               Crouch we would try to locate Mahammed. Cpl. Daniels checked
               the surrounding areas for Mahammed, while Ofc. Welter and I
               spoke with Crouch and Joswig-Jones. Cpl. Daniels was unable to
               locate Mahammed. Ofc. Welter and I went to the Compton Union
               Building to try to see if Mahammed was there, but we were
               unable to find him. I tried calling Mahammed on a couple
               different phone numbers that were listed from him, but neither
               of the numbers worked. I called WSU Dean of Students Office to
               give them a heads up about Mahammed. WSU Dean of Students
               Office told me they were already aware of the situation. At

               approximately 1300 hours Ofc. Welter and I went to Mahammed's
               residence, located at 1545 NE Merman Dr. Apt. 21 E. I knocked
               on the door to the Apt. 21 E, and Mahammed answered the door. I
               asked Mahammed if he knew why we were there, and he told me no.
               I told Mahammed it was about a meeting he had with one of his
               professor's earlier in the day. Mahammed told me that he had a
               meeting with one of his professor's, but he would not give me
               any details. Mahammed asked if we could speak outside, and I
               told him okay. Ofc. Welter and I followed Mahammed down to the
               parking lot. I told Mahammed he was being recorded. I again
               asked Mahammed to tell me what happened. He eventually told me
               he got into a "heated argument" with his professor. Mahammed
               still would not give me anymore details. I asked Mahammed if
               told Crouch he would be on him like ISIS. Mahammed replied
               "what's ISIS?". Ofc. Welter tried to explain to Mahammed he
               should not go to Crouch's house. Mahammed said he is allowed to
               go to his house if he wants, it is not against the law.
               Mahammed told us he is upset because he did not cheat. I
               originally told Mahammed I would be forwarding charges on him
               for Harassment. However, Mahammed told us he has a list of
               names of people, and he is going to make sure he makes it right
               before he leaves Pullman. When we asked him what he meant by
               that he would not go into further detail. Mahammed just said
               either him or his friend's will take care of it. Mahammed said
               he would be making sure it was handled either lawfully or
               unlawfully. I told Mahammed he was under arrest for Harassment.
               I reminded Mahammed he was being video recorded. I handcuffed
               Mahammed (double locked). I searched Mahammed incident to
               arrest, without further incident. Mahammed had $126 cash in one
               of his pocket's, and $171 cash in his wallet. Ofc. Welter and I
               counted all of the cash. I placed Mahammed in the back of my
               patrol car. I read Mahammed his Constitutional Rights from my
               department issued Miranda Warning Card. Mahammed said he
               understood his rights and he waived them. I transported
               Mahammed to Pullman Police Department and I placed him in a
               holding cell. Mahammed was later transported to the Whitman
               County Jail for booking with all of his property. No further
               action. My Vievu camera was activated, and the video has been
               downloaded into the permanent digital evidence folder. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 12th day of May, 2015, in Pullman,

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2344 SYNOPSIS: Non-injury accident
               caused by a vehicle rolling out of it's parking space. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 05-11-15 at
               approximately 1304 hours, I responded to the area of College
               Ave and Spokane St for a non-injury accident. I located the RP
               who stated they had watched the vehicle roll out of it's
               parking space, travel down the College Ave hill through the
               grass, cross College Ave, travel across two sidewalks, and then
               come to a stop against a gas pipeline vent pole located on the
               side of ETRL. The car came to a stop five feet from the
               building and was leaning on the vent pipe. I took photographs
               of the vehicle and could see where it had traveled across the
               grass and had jumped over the curb stop barrier in the parking
               lot. The vehicle managed to travel between two vehicles in the
               parking lot. I looked at both vehicles very closely and could
               not see any damage to either of them. The owner of the vehicle
               arrived after a few minutes and showed me where he had been
               parked in the gravel lot. He stated the vehicle had been parked
               across the parking lot. He stated he thought he had put it in
               gear with the emergency brake on. When he opened the door, I
               looked at the gear shift and observed the vehicle had been left
               in neutral. The owner was identified as Timothy Goheen by his
               WA Driver's License. I had him walk around his vehicle to see
               what damage there was. He stated the only damage he could see
               was the damage to the rear passenger side quarter panel and
               bumper which was caused when the vehicle collided with the vent
               pipe. Goheen was able to move his car off of the pipe and
               returned it to the parking lot. I provided him with the case
               number and advised him if there was any damage found to the
               pipe I would contact him. I had Whitcom contact Avista for the
               vent pipe as I wasn't sure if it had been damaged. They later
               responded and stated the pipe was a vent for the casing around
               the gas line. They did not see any immediate damage with the
               pipe and stated they would take care of having put back in
               place. I cleared the scene. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 12th day of May,
