               later spoke to Manuscripts staff and was advised an employee
               had accidentally set off the alarm. I was advised they were
               going to have a staff meeting to make sure staff knows the
               proper protocol if they set off the alarm by accident. I
               cleared. Employee error. I certify and declare under penalty of

               the vehicle, which I later learned Whitcom had not received a
               return for, parked there approximately 1 hr prior with its 4
               way flashers going. Upon my arrival I noticed the vehicle had
               received a ticket from parking services and as I was getting
               ready to leave my vehicle I noticed a tow truck arrive on
               scene. I confirmed with the driver that they had been contacted
               by the owner to have the vehicle towed. I was told the tow had
               been contacted by AAA. At this point I cleared and returned to
               service, returning later to find the vehicle had been removed
               from the roadway. Nothing further. I certify and declare under

               On 05-18-15 at approximately 1252 hours, I responded to the CUB
               for a suspicious male sitting in the food court. CUB Staff
               stated Pullman PD had dealt with the subject the night before
               for suspicious behavior. They stated the male, who they know as
               Colter Linford, had not done anything wrong, they just wanted
               us to be aware of him. They also stated he had come to the
               front desk, got a map, and started circling buildings saying
               something about wondering how he was going to keep himself busy
               today. They stated his behavior was very odd, and before I
               arrived he began walking with a tour group which had walked
               through the CUB. They saw him leave with the group towards the
               CUE. I checked the area, but was unable to find him. I sent an
               email to Counseling Services as I observed Colter has been
               contacted for odd behavior three other times this week. Email
               is attached in Files. I certify and declare under penalty of

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2454 SYNOPSIS: RP, Lewis Payne, called
               and said there were several cattle grazing on WSU property. I
               called and talked with Payne who said the cattle belong to
               Catherine Ulibarri. I called Ulibarri who said her hired man
               was putting the cattle back on her property. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 05-18-15 Lewis Payne
               called to report there were cattle grazing on WSU's Smoot Hill
               property. At about 1530 hours I called and left a message for
               Payne in an attempt to gather more information. At about 1610
               hours I was able to get in touch with Payne. He said this had
               been an ongoing problem but had gotten better for a while. He
               said a couple of weeks ago there were goats on the Smoot Hill
               property that belonged to the same owner. He said the owner was
               Catherine Ulibarri. Payne said he did not think Ulibarri lived
               on the property with the animals. Since Payne said this had
               been an ongoing event I looked up similar cases for that area
               and found a case with a Catherine Ulibarri listed as the owner
               of the animals in that case. At about 1628 I called the cell
               number listed for Ulibarri and told her it looked like her
               cattle were on WSU property. She said her hired man was there
               trying to get the animals back on her property. I called Payne
               back and brought him up to speed on what I had been told by
               Ulibarri. Officer Kirshner said he would go out and look at the
               property. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
