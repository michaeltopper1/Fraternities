               in the area who said they had seen 3 males and 1 female come in
               during the time. The only description they had was that the

               of cameras and recommended she contact Residence Life to voice
               her displeasure with this deficiency. I provided Galloway with
               my business card and her case number. I requested she email me
               descriptions, sizes, and costs of anything taken. She later
               emailed me the following: "1) Nike legging athletic pants, grey

               approximately 0030 hours Cpl. Kuhrt, Ofc. Whitman, and I were
               on foot patrol in the area of the blue parking lot, located at
               SE Forest Way. We heard someone exit a vehicle. We watched a
               male walk over to nearby bushes and begin to urinate. Once the
               male was finished we watched him walk back to a nearby vehicle
               and get into the driver seat. The vehicle did not leave the
               parking space. I walked over to the silver, 2009 Ford Focus (WA
               Lic. #892YUT) and contacted the driver of the vehicle. The
               driver was later identified as Tanner L. Hull (DOB 11-16-95). I
               told Hull I was contacting him because he was urinating in
               public, and that is against Pullman City Ordinance Code. Hull
               apologized for doing that. While I was speaking with Hull I
               noticed an open case of Busch Light in the back seat. I asked
               Hull if any of them were 21 years of age, and Hull said no sir.
               Hull told me the Busch Light belonged to him. I asked Hull if
               there was any marijuana in the vehicle. Hull reached into the
               center console and pulled out a glass jar containing green
               vegetable material. Based on my training and experience the
               green vegetable material appeared to be fresh marijuana. The
               other passengers were identified as Eric J. Perkins (DOB 01-10-
               96) and Leelye H. Kebede (DOB 02-11-96). Perkins was the only
               one in the vehicle with a medical marijuana card. Perkins said
               the marijuana in the vehicle does not belong to him. I asked
               Hull if the marijuana belongs to him, and he said yes. Hull
               admitted to smoking marijuana in the vehicle, and he said he
               was the only one smoking. There was also a glass pipe in the
               center console of the vehicle. There was an Altoid's tin in the
               center console as well. I asked Hull what was in it, and he
               handed me the tin. I asked if I could open it, and he said
               yeah. Hull also told me the tin belonged to him. I opened the
               tin and there was a small plastic bag containing a white
               substance powder. I asked Hull what it was, and he said it was
               molly and acid. There was also a rolled up dollar bill in the
               container. I asked if the rolled up dollar bill was used to

               Perkins he was free to go. I told Kebede he was free to leave
               as well. Perkins and Kebede left the vehicle and the area. Cpl.
               Kuhrt asked Hull for consent to search his vehicle. Cpl. Kuhrt
               told Hull consent is voluntary, he could limit the scope of the
               search, and he could stop the search at any time. Cpl. Kuhrt
               asked Hull if he understood, and he said "yes sir". Hull agreed
               to let us search his vehicle. Hull stood next to his vehicle,
               as Ofc. Whitman and I searched the vehicle. During the search
               the following items were located in the following locations: -
               Metal grinder with marijuana inside found in glove box. -Stem
               containing burnt marijuana from smoking device found in center
               console. -"Marijuana wax" on white paper found under the
               passenger side floor mat. -Two small rubber containers
               containing burnt marijuana residue found on top of the center
               instrument panel. All the above listed items were seized and
               later logged into evidence. The 21 cans of Busch Light was
               seized as well, along with the small jar containing fresh
               marijuana. I later tested the marijuana from the glass jar with
               a NIK Test. The results showed a presumptive positive for the
               presence of cannabis sativa. I later tested the acid from the
               tin foil in the Altoids can with a NIK Test. The results showed
               a presumptive positive for the presence of LSD. I later tested
               the molly from the small plastic bag with a NIK Test. The
               results showed a presumptive positive for the presence of MDMA.
               The 21 cans of Busch Light were later poured down the sink at
               the department, and Ofc. Whitman witnessed it. I took
               photographs of the seized evidence, along with results of the
               NIK Test Kits. The photographs have been downloaded into
               Spillman. I explained to Hull I would be forwarding charges to
               the Whitman County Prosecuting Attorney's Officer for Minor in
               Possession of Alcohol, Possession of Marijuana, and Possession
               of Controlled Substances. I also told Hull I would be notifying
               WSU Student Conduct. Ofc. Westerman arrived on scene with
               evidence bags for the items we seized. Cpl. Kuhrt, Ofc.
               Westerman, Ofc. Whitman, and I cleared the scene. No further
               action. My Vievu camera was activated, and the video has been
               downloaded into the permanent digital evidence folder. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 4th day of May, 2015, in Pullman,
