               Hotel. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Joshua W.
               Daniels (100779) Arrested/Booked Possession of Child
               Pornography 2. NARRATIVE: On 052215 at approximately 1333
               hours, I was dispatched to contact Steve R. Vreeken, who
               manages the Residence Inn Marriott on NE N. Fairway Road,
               regarding a potential computer crime case. Upon contact,
               Vreeken told me that one of his employees has a file on a work
               computer containing several videos of a possible voyeurism case
               of a child. I responded to the Residence Inn and contacted
               Vreeken and Andrew I. Wardlow. I asked what was going on and
               Wardlow told me that he manages the maintenance for the
               Residence Inn Marriott. He stated he was searching for a file
               on his work computer and stumbled across a file labeled (Mar.
               09 2015) in the videos section of the computer. He stated he
               opened several videos to see what they were and noticed they
               were of Joshua Daniels setting up the camera in a bathroom.
               Wardlow continued watching one of the videos and saw Daniels
               leave the bathroom. A short while later, he noticed a young
               female enter the bathroom, remove her clothes and step into the
               shower. He saw this and immediately turned off the video and
               notified his supervisors. He stated that his Marriott
               management told him to copy the videos to a SanDisk flash drive
               and call the police. Wardlow told me he did as instructed by
               his corporate management and I responded. I asked Wardlow to
               show me the computer and he took me to a back office where the
               maintenance department works out of and showed me the computer.
               I asked him if they shared a computer and Wardlow stated all
               computers in the Residence Inn shared a login for all the
               computers, but primarily Daniels and he shared that computer. I
               asked Wardlow if he knew anything about him purchasing a camera
               and he stated that sometime around the first of the year he
               bought a digital camera from Amazon.com. He told me Daniels
               claimed that he had a roommate that was stealing from his house
               and he was going to video record the roommate stealing. I asked
               Wardlow if he recognized anyone in the video and he told me he
               recognized Daniels setting up the camera and he knew that
               Daniels' girlfriend had a teenage daughter and Wardlow believed
               the videos were of her. I clicked on video labeled "003" and
               noticed Daniels setting up the camera in a bathroom and
               standing back to see if it was appropriately positioned. When
               satisfied, Daniels left the bathroom and less than a minute

               passed before a young female entered the bathroom and turned on
               the shower. She proceeded to close the door, disrobe and pass
               in front of the camera naked. The camera showed her body from
               her neck to the top of her pubic area. She proceeded to shower
               and when she was finished, she dried off in front of the camera
               where her breasts and pubic area were both visible. She
               appeared to be approximately 13-14 years of age, which was
               later confirmed by Daniels that the videos were of Natasha F.
               Bush (11/30/2000). I watched video labeled "004" and noticed
               Daniels setting up a camera to get a lower angle in the same
               general direction of video 003. Shortly after Daniels set up
               the camera, Natasha entered the bathroom and proceeded to
               disrobe and shower. This video showed between Natasha's belly
               button and her thigh with close up video of her vaginal area. I
               stopped the video and advised Wardlow and Vreeken that I was
               ready to talk to Daniels. At this point, Ofc. Olmstead had
               arrived and assisted with the interview of Daniels. Wardlow
               called Daniels into the office and I contacted him there. I
               asked him to come in a talk to me and did. I advised him that I
               was video recording the interview and he told me he understood.
               I advised Daniels of his Miranda rights and he told me he
               understood his rights and would talk to me. During the
               interview, Daniels told me that he had a roommate, Auda Reed,
               he suspected was stealing from his residence. He stated he
               bought the camera around Christmas time (2014) and he purchased
               it to attempt to catch Reed stealing from his residence. Ofc.
               Olmstead asked if he had the camera with him and he stated it
               was in his truck in the parking lot. I asked Daniels if I could
               see the camera and he walked me to the parking lot, unlocked
               his truck, removed a small black camera from a jacket and
               handed it to me. We walked back to the room and continued the
               interview. I asked him where he positioned the camera and he
               stated in his bathroom because he had hydro medication that he
               thought she might steal. He stated he accidentally caught
               Natasha on the camera taking off her clothes and that wasn't
               his intention. He told me he accidentally caught Natasha taking
               off her clothes several times in the bathroom in an attempt to
               catch Reed stealing. He also stated he put the camera in
               Natasha's bedroom on a bookshelf attempting to get Reed
               stealing from his bedroom that could be seen through Natasha's
               door and the hallway into his room. I asked how many videos he
               took in Natasha's room and told me he took several and there
               were approximately five of them of her disrobing in the
               bedroom. He eventually admitted that he had dual intentions of
               catching Natasha taking off her clothes and catching Reed
               stealing. I asked if he downloaded the videos on his computer
               at home and he told me that he tried to, but he was having
               computer problems. He believed his computer had a virus and it
               wasn't working properly. I asked him if he watched pornography
               at home and he told me he did. I asked him if he viewed
               pornography of girls under the age of 18 and he told me he
               didn't. I believed Daniels wasn't being completely honest with
               me throughout the interview. I placed Daniels under arrest for
               possession of child pornography and had him transported to
               Pullman PD for holding by Ofc. Edwards. I returned to the

               computer and quickly watched the other videos. There were 14
               videos total and two or three of them were taken in Natasha's
               room. The videos taken in Natasha's bedroom did not contain
               Natasha taking off her clothes. There were no other videos of
               Natasha disrobing in the file on his work computer other than
               the videos labeled 003 and 004. I believe that there is a
               likelihood there are more videos of Natasha in her bedroom and
               they are unaccounted for at this point in the investigation. I
               seized the camera and SanDisk flash drive and Ofc. Jones seized
               the Marriott computer for evidence. I contacted Moscow Child
               Protective Services and explained the situation, and I notified
               Moscow PD for further investigation of Daniels' computer.
               Investigation continues. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 22nd day of May,
               2015, in Pullman, Washington.
