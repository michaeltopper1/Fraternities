               activated it prior to our arrival which Whitcom confirmed.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #:15-W2323 SYNOPSIS: Report of a vehicle vs
               pedestrian collision. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               2. NARRATIVE: On 05/09/15 at approximately 2230 hours I was
               dispatched to a cold collision. Whitcom radioed that the
               reporting party's daughter was hit by a vehicle and he was
               transporting her to the hospital. I called the reporting party,
               John Jeffrey, and asked what happened. Jeffrey explained that
               his daughter, Danielle Jeffrey, had graduated from vet school
               at Beasley. Danielle was walking in the parking lot of Beasley
               when a vehicle struck her. I asked Jeffrey if I could speak
               with Danielle, or if she was being treated. Jeffrey explained
               that she was being treated. Jeffrey said he spoke with the
               driver of the car and provided me with his phone number. I told
               Jeffrey I would contact the driver and then stop by the
               hospital. I called the phone number Jeffrey provided and a
               subject answered the phone and identified himself as Daron G.
               Sutton 10/21/69. I asked Sutton to tell me what happened.
               Sutton explained that he was leaving the parking lot from being
               at the baseball game. Sutton explained that he was on Ferdinand
               Ln preparing to turn left onto Stadium Way. Sutton said he
               reached to the console to turn down the air and accidentally
               put the car into neutral. Sutton said he looked down and put
               the car in drive and it went forward. Sutton said when he
               looked back up he heard a noise and when he went further, he
               could see someone off to the side of the vehicle. Sutton said
               the subject was walking in the crosswalk when he hit her and
               she was traveling southbound. Sutton said he stopped and spoke
               with the person and asked if she was ok. The subject told him
               she hurt her arm. Sutton offered to assist her in any way, but
               the subject said she would contact her parents. Sutton provided
               the subject with his contact information and left. I asked
               Sutton if I could meet with him. Sutton said he was staying at
               The Holiday Inn Express and would meet me out front. I
               responded and spoke with Sutton. Sutton showed me his vehicle
               (a rental car). We looked at the vehicle for any damage and all
               I could find was a rub mark near the driver's door handle.
               Sutton said he did not think that came from her since he did
               not remember her being at his door. Sutton showed me the
               interior of the vehicle. I noticed that on the center console
               there are two dial type knobs, one for climate control and one
               to turn to shift amongst gears. The two knobs are within two
               inches of each other. I provided Sutton with my business card
               and case number and I wrote down Sutton's insurance information

               (Farmers #188237460). Sutton told me that he was very shaken up
               by the collision. Sutton said it was "his mistake" and he
               wanted to make sure he took care of everything for the girl and
               her family. I asked Sutton if he remembered what the subject
               was wearing and he said he didn't. I asked Sutton how fast he
               thought he was going and he said under 5 MPH. I responded to
               the hospital and met with Jeffrey. I learned that Danielle was
               still being treated. I gave Jeffrey my business card with the
               case number. I asked Jeffrey to call dispatch as soon as they
               were done at the hospital so I could talk with Danielle. At
               approximately 0125 hours Jeffrey called me and advised that
               they took Danielle home and put her to bed because she was
               really shook up. I asked Jeffrey if I would be able to talk
               with Danielle tonight and he said probably not. I told Jeffrey
               I would have a dayshift officer follow up. I asked Jeffrey what
               a good time would be to call and he said after 0900 hours.
               Investigation continues. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 10th day of May,
               2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2325 SYNOPSIS: Pullman PD requested
               assistance with a crowd/fight at Adams Mall. Assistance was
               provided and one subject transported at PPD's request. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Satori Z. Butler/101393 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 05/10/15 at about 0213 hrs I heard Pullman PD
               request assistance at Adams Mall regarding a fight and large
               crowd outside. I responded and upon my arrival found several
               Pullman Officers outside directing people off the patio in
               front of Adams Mall. A short time later Officer Myklebust came
               out of the building with a female, later identified as Satori
               Z. Butler (101393), in handcuffs. He advised she was under
               arrest for assault 4th degree for hitting one of the bar staff
               in the head. He asked if we could put Butler in my patrol
               vehicle, which was parked close by. Butler was intoxicated and
               very belligerent. She was yelling about not having been read
               her rights. Officer Myklebust told her she had been read her
               rights previously. She was placed in my patrol car and I was
               asked to transport her to the Pullman PD holding facility.
               Butler continued to be belligerent in the back of the patrol
               car, yelling about why she was under arrest and how I was
               violating her rights. After arriving at the Pullman PD holding
               facility Butler continued her behavior, demanding a phone call
               because she had a child at home. I told her I was not going to
               make any phone calls for her. I told her to walk to the holding
               cell and she began to argue again. I took her by the arm to
               direct her to the holding cell and she became further agitated.
               She then began complaining because she did not want me to take
               her out of the handcuffs due to her short skirt/dress. I told
               her there was no one else to come remove the handcuffs and I
               was going to do it. When I went to remove the first handcuff
               she tried to pull away and turn around toward me. I grabbed her
               arm and applied a reverse goose neck. She began complaining
               that I was just hurting her because I was racist and was
               purposely trying to hurt her because I was racist. I waited for
               another officer to arrive so I could remove the handcuffs.
               Officer Emerson arrived and assisted in removing Butler's
               handcuffs. Butler tried to turn around and push out of the cell
               briefly before we were able to get her in the cell and the door
               closed. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 10 day of May, 2015,

               requesting an AOA for a male who was reported to be walking
               down the middle of SR 27. One male contacted a give a courtesy

               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Gamaliel Rodriguez 02/02/94 Transported
               2. NARRATIVE: On 05/10/15 at approximately 0340 hours I was
               asked to check on a male who was walking down State Route 27.
               Dispatch stated the male was walking in the middle of the
               highway and was last seen around mile post 6 or 7. I responded
               to the area and found a male, later identified as Gamaliel
               Rodriguez 02/02/94, waving his arms around mile post 8. I
               contacted Rodriguez and had him put his hands up. Rodriguez
               complied and I searched him for weapons finding none. I asked
               Rodriguez what he was doing and Rodriguez said he was trying to
               walk to the Providence Court apartments. As Rodriguez spoke I
               could smell the very strong odor of intoxicants coming from his
               breath. I told Rodriguez that he was walking the wrong way and
               he had walked about 8 miles in the wrong direction. I asked
               Rodriguez if he wanted a ride home and he said yes. While
               heading back to Pullman, Rodriguez said he had went to a
               friends house to drink and when he started to walk home he got
               lost. Rodriguez asked someone on the street which way it was to
               Providence Court and the person said keep walking down the
               street. So Rodriguez kept walking on Grand Ave northbound for
               approximately two hours. Once at the Providence Court
               Apartments, I dropped Rodriguez off at his apartment, G102, and
               cleared. END OF REPORT I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
