    Narrative: RVWD: dd/329 OFC: ENW/328 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2505 SYNOPSIS: Report of a suspicious
               individual who was attempting to gain access to Dana Hall
               through a window. It was determined the individual was trying
               to gain access to retrieve his wallet he had left behind.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Clay, Erik M (091993)
               Warned Burglary/Mal Misc 2. NARRATIVE: On 05-23-15 around 1235
               hrs Ofc Olmstead and I were dispatched to a report of a
               suspicious individual trying to gain access to Dana Hall
               through a window. Upon our arrival Olmstead contacted an
               individual, later identified as Nicholas J Lawrence (09-19-93),
               and told the following. Lawrence explained he had seen a male,
               whom he described as white, and wearing a black shirt, trying
               to gain access to the building. This male, later identified as
               Erik M Clay (09-19-93), had been checking the exterior doors
               before hopping down into a window well and attempting to gain
               access to the robotics lab through the window. Lawrence left to
               contact his supervisor and when he returned the male was gone.
               Olmstead and I searched the area and were unable to locate
               Clay. Upon entering the Robotics Lab we noticed the screen
               covering the window on the Southeast side of the room had been
               bent and had left fresh finger marks on the window pane. The
               window was checked and found to be locked and did not appear to
               have been opened or any any items near it disturbed. We looked
               around the lab and a wallet and ID belonging to Clay was
               located sitting on top of a table. I attempted to contact Clay
               and left a message for him to contact me upon receiving the
               message. While I was doing this Olmstead spoke with Lawrence
               again and showed him a photo of Clay. Lawrence confirmed to
               Olmstead he had been the individual he had seen trying to enter
               the lab through the window. A check of Zzusis showed an address
               for Clay at 880 NE Providence Ct, but did not show an apartment
               number. I took possession of the wallet from Olmstead and went
               to the address I had located while Olmstead photographed the
               damage to the window screen before he cleared. Upon reaching
               the Providence Ct address I was not able to locate the vehicle
               I had found associated with Clay (Wa. 332YJZ) or Clay. I
               attempted to contact him again by phone, without success before
               I cleared. Sometime later I reached Clay by phone and he agreed
               to meet me at his apartment, 880 NE Providence Ct; A101, and
               upon contacting him was told the following. Clay told me he had
               left his wallet in the lab yesterday (05-22-15), and wanted to
               retrieve it. He went on to explain he had gone to Dana Hall and
               found the door locked. I asked him if this was why he had

               jumped down into the window well, and he told me it was. At
               this point I explained he had damaged the window screen when he
               tried to open the window. He told me he had not realized that.
               As we continued to speak I told him there were a few problems
               with what he had done and warned him of the possible legal
               violations he had committed as a result. I also explained what
               he could do in the future to avoid this type of a problem. In
               addition I told him he would need to contact whoever was in
               charge of the lab and make arrangements to have the screen
               repaired. He told me he would and after speaking with him
               cleared a short time later. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               23rd day of May, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.
