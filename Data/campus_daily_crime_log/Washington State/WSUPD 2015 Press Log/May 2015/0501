               me she has no idea who may have caused the damage to the wall.
               I estimated $100 to repair the damaged wall. I took photographs
               of the damage and attached them to the case. Case inactive

               report of a juvenile owl on the ground near Neill Hall.
               Cordoned off an area to keep people from disturbing two
               juvenile owls and an adult owl protecting them. Nothing
               further. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 05/01/15 at about 1745 hours I was dispatched to a report of
               a juvenile owl on the ground near Neill Hall. I responded and
               found one juvenile owl on the ground near a tree. In the tree
               was another juvenile owl and an adult owl. The adult made
               noises which I took as a warning. The reporting party was from
               the Vet Hospital and suggested to dispatch the area be taped
               off so the adult would not attack people if they got near the
               juvenile. I took the advise and cordoned off an area to keep
               people from disturbing two juvenile owls and the adult owl that
               was protecting them. I later called the veterinarian that
               reported the owl. She said the juvenile would learn to fly in
               the next few days, she said it did not appeared injured when
               she saw it. The juvenile moved a couple time through the
               evening. Cougar Security and I checked on it a few times
               throughout the evening and attempted to cordon off the area as
               it moved. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 2nd day of May, 2015,

    Narrative: RVWD:MTK/336 OFC: Whitman / 323 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY
               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2139 SYNOPSIS: Responded to a
               report of a non-injury vehicle accident in the Green lot at the
               Stephenson Complex. A male driver struck a parked vehicle. I
               confirmed both drivers exchanged information. Nothing further.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               05/01/15 at about 1808 I was dispatched to a report of a non-
               injury vehicle accident in the Green lot at the Stephenson
               Complex. The reporting party said she saw a vehicle back out of
               a parking space into another vehicle. The driver, Bolong Zeng,
               got out of his vehicle and left a note on the vehicle that was
               struck. The note gave a phone number and a first name. I
               arrived and talked to the reporting party and the owner of the
               vehicle that was struck, Joel E. Mamerto. I called the number
               that was left by Zeng. I confirmed Zeng gave all the proper
               information to Mamerto. The collision did not appear to reach
               the amount of damage to be reportable (approximately $250.00).
               I photographed the vehicle struck (WA/AUB7629), and gave
               Mamerto the case number. Nothing further. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               2nd day of May, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               1107. He said there was also some sort of cover odor. I asked

               that the odor was marijuana. He said a 6 or 7 so I decided to
               respond and contact the resident. Upon my arrival at room 1107
               I could smell a faint odor of burnt marijuana and some sort of
               body spray type smell. I knocked on the door several times but
               there was no answer. The hall staff on scene said the resident
               may have left the room but they were unsure. I cleared the

               Davis 07/19/96 Charges Forwarded MIP Exhibiting 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 05/01/15 at approximately 2324 hours, I responded to an
               intoxication call at Northside Hall. Dispatch stated there was
               a male inside the stairwell of Northside that was vomiting and
               trying to get away from Hall Staff. Medics were dispatched at
               the same time. I asked for a description of the male and
               dispatch stated they would try to get one. I responded to the
               northern stairwell of Northside Hall. As I was pulling up a
               male came staggering out of the stairwell of Northside. Still
               not having a description of who I was looking for I decided to
               social contact the male to see if he knew anything. I walked up
               to the male and asked him if he had a second to talk. The male,
               later identified as Jackie L. Davis 07/19/96, stopped to talk
               to me. As Davis stopped, I noticed he appeared to be well under
               the age of 21. I told Davis what I had been called to and Davis
               said he did not know anything about that. Davis was standing
               very close to me and I could clearly smell the very strong odor
               of intoxicants coming from his breath. Davis began to tell me
               about a girl who was running around the dorm who was
               intoxicated. It seemed as if Davis was making up the story on
               the spot. I noticed two RA's standing near the stairwell exit
               doors and Ofc. Boyd went over to talk to them. Ofc. Boyd later
               told me that Davis is the person the RA's had called about. I
               asked Davis if he had his ID and Davis said he did not. Davis
               provided his name and date of birth verbally. I asked Davis how
               much he had to drink tonight. Davis said not a lot. I asked how
               much that was for him and Davis again said "one sip two sips."
               While asking my questions Davis kept trying to talk about the
               female who was running around the dorm. I had to tell Davis to
               pay attention to the question I was asking several times. I
               asked Davis if I could look at his eyes and he said I could. I
               performed an HGN test on Davis. I instructed Davis to stand
               with his heels and toes together while keeping his arms at his
               sides. I told Davis to keep his head still and follow the tip
               of my pen with his eyes only. As soon as I moved my pen, Davis
               moved his head to follow it. I reminded Davis to keep his head
               still and only follow with his eyes. During the test Davis
               stopped following the pen and started staring at me. I asked
               Davis why he was not following the pen and Davis said he was. I
               told Davis that he was looking straight at me and Davis started

               to look at the pen again. During the test I observed, equal
               pupil size, equal tracking, lack of smooth pursuit, and
               distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation in both
               eyes. Davis' eyes were watery. I asked Davis if he was willing
               to provide a PBT sample and Davis said "sure." I found my PBT
               (Alco-Sensor FST #16805) in working condition. Davis provided a
               PBT sample of .122. I told Davis that he was under arrest for
               MIP Exhibiting and handcuffed (D/L) him. I advised Davis that
               he was being audio and video recorded. I had Ofc. Boyd read
               Davis his Miranda Rights as I searched him. I found no weapons
               or illegal items. I placed Davis in the backseat of my patrol
               car as I contacted the RAs. I contacted RA Sarah Cundiff who
               provided the following story. Cundiff was doing rounds when she
               came across Davis passed out on a couch in a common room.
               Cundiff tried to check on Davis and Davis just rolled over.
               Once Davis woke up, he started to walk away from the RAs who
               were trying to call for medics to respond for Davis who
               appeared to be highly intoxicated. Davis then entered the
               stairwell where he preceded to vomit down the stairs. A few
               moments later Davis exited the building as I arrived on scene.
               The RA's confirmed that the person I had arrested was the
               person they had called about. I returned to Davis and
               researched his name. I found that Davis had no prior contacts
               for alcohol or drugs. I told Davis that I would be forwarding
               charges for MIP Exhibiting to the prosecutor. I explained the
               process and released Davis from custody. I told Davis to go
               back inside and not to come back out in public. Davis is a
               member of the WSU Basketball team. I notified Bill Stevens of
               Davis' arrest. END OF REPORT I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 3rd day of

               A. Falk (122894) Student Conduct MIP/False Statement 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 050115 at approximately 2335 hours I was driving
               eastbound on NE Cougar Way in a marked patrol vehicle. As I
               approached the crosswalk near the Global Scholars Hall
               construction site I saw 3 people looking at the construction
               sign and about to walk along the side of the road void of a
               sidewalk. I stopped and instructed them to cross at the
               crosswalk and use the sidewalk on the other side. As the 3
               walked across in front of me, I recognized one of them as Lucas
               A. Falk (122894). I rolled down my passenger side window and
               called after Falk, he responded that it was him and informed me
               he was with "Devonte" (Devonte McClain (072992). As Falk spoke
               I could hear a distinctive slurring of his speech. I then asked
               "how old are you" and he responded "21". I said "oh okay, I'll
               pull over and talk" looking to only make social contact. Falk
               was free to go at this point. I pulled forward approximately
               340 ft to the Bohler Gym bus stop. I got out and walked back
               towards Falk and McClain. They were nowhere in sight. Falk had
               stated he was going to his girlfriend's residence hall and
               pointed towards the area NE of the construction site. That area
               was all fenced off. A change in direction made no sense. I
               checked the area and could not find them but ran into the third
               person they had been with, Frederikke Hall (061592). She
               confirmed that Falk was trying to get to his girlfriend's room.
               I checked our WSU database and confirmed that Falk was under 21
               yoa. I radioed Ofc. Westerman who was closer to Northside
               Residence Hall and asked if he had seen Falk and McClain,
               giving him a description. He had not. I cleared. About 5
               minutes later Ofc. Westerman said he he saw two males matching
               Falk's and McClain's description walking northbound on Stadium
               Way towards NE Cougar Way. I responded and found them at Flag
               Ln. I activated my camera at this time. I spoke with Falk who
               admitted he was 20. Ofc. Westerman arrived as backup and I had
               him stand with McClain who was told he could wait or leave.
               McClain was very cooperative. I then checked Falk's eyes and
               observed a lack of smooth pursuit and distinct and sustained
               nystagmus in both eyes. He admitted to drinking 5 beers. I
               could smell the odor intoxicants on his breath. Falk said they
               had been at a block party to "see a friend rap". I asked Falk
               to provide a breath sample and he did. His sample registered

               Trespassing NARRATIVE: On 05/02/15 at approximately 0014 hours
               I was driving northbound on Library Road when I spot lighted
               the roof of Kimbrough Hall. I saw two people sitting on the
               roof. When the spot light hit them they attempted to lay down
               so I would not see them. Ofc. Petlovany and I went up to the
               roof and I found Quinten Thomas Boyd 08/22/92 and Jessica Ann
               Maas 12/15/92 trying to hide in a corner. I told both that they
               were not doing a good job hiding and asked for their IDs. Both
               provided their WADL's. I explained that they were trespassing
               and pointed out the sign that they climbed over stating that
               nobody was allowed on the roof. Boyd and Maas were run through
               dispatch and both came back clear. I escorted both off the roof
               and explained the crime of criminal trespass. I told the two
               they were being warned for trespassing but I would be notifying
               student conduct of the situation. Both stated they understood.

               Benjamin O. McWithey (050196) for Possession of Marijuana.

               POM 5Z0568383 2. Sasha W. Kraus (093095) Warned POM NARRATIVE:
               On 050215 at approximately 0037 hours I cleared a traffic stop
               near the Green 2 Lot next to the President's Residence on NE
               Campus St. I pulled into the parking lot to turn around and saw
               a vehicle with it's brake lights on. I approached the vehicle
               and could smell the odor of marijuana coming from the window
               that was rolled down on the driver's side. I saw a bag in the
               center console with a varied assortment of drug paraphernalia,
               to include pipes and glass jars that looked to contain
               marijuana. The vehicle was running and I contacted the driver,
               Benjamin O. McWithey (050196). He confirmed he was not over 21
               and admitted to having pipes and marijuana. I had him turn the
               vehicle off. McWithey was handling what appeared to be a
               scalpel and I had him set it down. I instructed both he and his
               passenger Sasha W. Kraus (093095), not to touch anything that
               appeared to be a weapon. I then awaited Ofc. Westerman to
               arrive. The two confirmed they did not have a medicinal
               marijuana card. Ofc. Westerman arrived and I advised him of the
               weapons. I told Kraus to follow his instructions in getting out
               of the car. I had McWithey exit the vehicle and asked him to
               grab the bag of assorted items. I had him place it on top of
               the vehicle. I then patted him down for weapons. He provided me
               with his identification and confirmed he was a WSU Student. I
               then looked through the bag and he claimed all items. Later
               Kraus would claim the scissors in the bag. In the bag I found
               and seized the following: 1. 1 marijuana joint .63 g 2. Green
               vegetable material (GVM) in a glass jar with a burned $1 bill
               and a pitbull decorated baggy. 2.6 g 3. Trace amounts of GVM in
               black capped jar 4. GVM in "Earth's Best" jar .83 g 5. GVM in
               Red plastic cap jar .97 g As I spoke with McWithey I could
               smell the odor of intoxicants on his breath. I initially asked
               permission to search the vehicle from McWithey but then learned
               it was Kraus's vehicle. Both declined to provide consent to
               search. McWithey confirmed they both had been smoking out of
               one of his pipes in the car. I placed McWithey under arrest
               (handcuffed) for possession of marijuana less than 40 grams. I
               read him his Miranda rights and informed him that we were being
               audio and visually recorded. I checked his eyes and observed a

               lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes. He admitted to consuming
               alcohol (MD 20/20). He was searched incident to arrest and
               placed in the back of my patrol car and completed Sector
               Citation #5Z0568383 for possession of marijuana. I issued and
               explained the citation to him once it was complete. He was then
               released and instructed that it would be advisable to get rid
               of his pipes that had a residue. We all cleared and I later
               entered the seized items into evidence. Nothing follows. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
