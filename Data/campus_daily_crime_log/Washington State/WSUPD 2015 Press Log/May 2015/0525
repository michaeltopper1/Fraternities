               driving through the fourth floor of the Fine Arts Parking
               Garage, located at 1615 NE Wilson Rd. Instead of turning around
               to exit the parking garage I tried to drive my patrol vehicle
               (Vehicle 41), down the slopped ramp at the end of the parking
               garage. As I began to go down the slopped ramp my vehicle was
               high centered and the back right tire was lifted off the
               ground. I was unable to reverse or go forward. I was not

               could reverse out. There were a few scrapes on the concrete
               where my patrol vehicle had been high centered. There did not
               appear to be any damage to the vehicle. Cpl. Daniels took
               photographs of the area. The photographs have been downloaded
               into Spillman. Ofc. Breshears from Pullman Police Department

               approximately 2223 hours Ofc. Petlovany and I were monitoring
               traffic on Stadium Way from Flag Lane. Ofc. Petlovany radioed
               that there was a car heading southbound on Stadium Way with a
               head light out. I pulled forward on Flag Lane and saw a Subaru
               Legacy wagon heading southbound on Stadium Way that had a
               driver's side headlight that was not working. I pulled behind
               the Subaru and initiated a traffic stop at Stadium Way near
               Wilson Road. I contacted the driver, Tenaya Lynn Sigler
               08/04/96, identified myself, told the driver I was recording,
               and explained the reason for the stop. Sigler already had her
               driver's license and proof of insurance out and handed me them
               when I asked. While standing at the front window I could smell
               the odor of burnt marijuana coming from within the car. I asked
               Sigler if she had a medical marijuana card. Sigler said no. I
               asked Sigler how much marijuana was in the car and Sigler said
               just a little bit. Without prompt, Sigler opened the center
               console and removed a green pill bottle that contained a green
               vegetable matter (GVM) in it. Sigler handed me the pill bottle
               without me asking. Based on my training and experience I
               instantly recognized the GVM to be marijuana. I asked Sigler
               what she smokes with and Sigler reached into her glovebox and
               retrieved a small glass pipe with burnt marijuana residue in
               the bowl. Again Sigler handed me the item without my asking. I
               asked Sigler if she had been contacted by the Police for
               alcohol or drugs before and she said no. I later found out that
               Sigler had been contacted for marijuana twice in the last 12
               months. About this time the front passenger, Natalie Elizabeth
               Rock 10/03/97, spoke up as said that the marijuana was hers. I
               asked for Rock's ID but she said she lost her wallet recently.
               Rock provided her information verbally. Rock said she did not
               have a medical marijuana card. I again asked if all the
               marijuana was hers and Rock said yes. I asked if they had
               smoked recently and that was why the car smelled of burnt
               marijuana. Sigler spoke up and said that they had smoked last
               night in the car and that is why it smelled. There was one
               other passenger in the backseat. The back passenger, Jade

               Estelle Hulet 11/10/97, provided her WADL. I walked back to the
               driver's side window to speak with Sigler. I advised Sigler of
               the Ferrier Warnings and Sigler said I had her permission to
               search the car. Sigler, Rock, and Hulet stood at the front of
               the car which Ofc. Petlovany as I searched the car. I found no
               other illegal items in the car. I returned to Sigler and Hulet
               and told them they were free to go if they so wished. I asked
               Rock to speak with me away from the other two. I told Rock that
               I needed to talk to one of her parents because she was a minor.
               Rock attempted to call her mother but her mother's phone was
               turned off. Rock said he mother is a flight attendant who was
               flying to Japan. Rock said her mother has full custody of her
               and her father has been out of the picture since she was two
               years old. Rock said she could call her sister who is 21 years
               old. I told Rock to call. Rock called her sister, Emily Grace
               Rock 01/04/94, who answered. Rock quickly told Emily what had
               happened and handed me the phone. I spoke with Emily and
               explained the situation. I asked Emily if she was giving me
               permission to turn Rock over to Sigler. Emily said that was
               fine. I provided Emily with my contact information in case
               their mother needed to reach me. I explained to Rock that I
               would be forwarding charges of possession of marijuana less
               than 40 grams to juvenile services. I explained the process to
               Rock and provided her with my business card and her case
               number. Rock was released to Sigler and all three drove away.
               Once back at the station, the seized items were logged into
               evidence. The marijuana NIC tested presumptive positive for
               Cannabis. Charges of possession of marijuana less than 40 grams
               will be forwarded to juvenile services. END OF REPORT I certify

               Marijuana 2. NARRATIVE: On 05/25/15 at approximately 2327 hours
               Ofc. Petlovany and I were monitoring traffic on Stadium Way
               from Wagner Hall. Ofc. Petlovany was operating the Decatur
               Scout stationary handheld radar and obtained a reading of 28
               MPH on a 2001 Dodge Stratus that was heading southbound on
               Stadium Way. Ofc. Petlovany radioed me the speed as I was
               parked out of view of traffic. I pulled forward and saw the
               vehicle that Ofc. Petlovany had observed. I pulled behind the
               Dodge and initiated a traffic stop at Stadium Way and Shock
               Physics. I contacted the driver, Zachery Arnold Schramm
               03/13/95, identified myself, informed Schramm I was recording,
               and explained the reason for the stop. About this time Ofc.
               Petlovany arrived on scene who was on bike patrol. Schramm
               provided his Michigan Driver's license and proof of insurance.
               Ofc. Petlovany pointed to the backseat area so I shinned my
               flashlight back there. I noticed a 6-pack of ping pong balls
               with marijuana leaf's stamped on them. There was also a
               backpack with Jamaican colors on it. Both reference marijuana
               usage. I decided to ask Schramm how much marijuana was in the
               car. I first asked Schramm if he had a medical marijuana card
               and he said no. I asked how much marijuana he had and Schramm
               said about a gram. I asked if I could see what he had and
               Schramm turned around to get into the Jamaican colored
               backpack. The top of the backpack was string drawn and Schramm
               only opened the top just enough to get his hand into it. It
               appeared as if Schramm did not want me to see into the bag.
               Schramm pulled out a glass bong with burnt residue in the bowl.
               I asked if I could see it and Schramm handed it to me. I again
               asked about the marijuana and Schramm reached back into his bag
               again only opening it slightly. This time he grabbed a sandwich
               bag that had a very small amount of green vegetable matter
               (GVM) that I instantly recognized as marijuana based on my
               training and experience. When Schramm was getting the sandwich
               bag out I could see several other sandwich bags. I told Schramm
               that it seemed as if he was picking and choosing what he wanted
               me to see. I asked what else he had in his bag and he brought
               out another sandwich bag with about two grams of marijuana in
               in. I told Schramm that one flake of marijuana all the way to
               40 grams of marijuana is the same charge. So therefore if he

               was worried about having more as long as it was under 40 grams
               he would not be in any additional trouble. I asked Schramm if I
               could look at in his backpack and he said I could. Schramm
               handed me his backpack and I found nothing else illegal in the
               bag. Schramm said he had thought about getting his medical
               marijuana authorization but had never gotten around to it. I
               thanked Schramm for his cooperation and explained that I would
               be forwarding charges of possession of marijuana less than 40
               grams to the prosecutor. I explained the process to Schramm and
               also told him my case would be referred to student conduct. I
               told Schramm that he was free to go and he drove off. Once back
               at the station, the seized items were logged into evidence. The
               marijuana NIC tested presumptive positive for Cannabis. Charges
               of possession of marijuana less than 40 grams will be forwarded
               to the prosecutor. END OF REPORT I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 26th day of
               May, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.
