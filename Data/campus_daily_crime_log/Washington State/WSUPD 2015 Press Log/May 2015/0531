    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: ENW/328 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2574 SYNOPSIS: Request for an agency
               assist with a civil call. Assistance provided. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Whatley, Michael S (09/27/83) Contacted
               2. McDaniel, Cheyenne R (07/13/92) Contacted NARRATIVE: On
               05/31/15 around 1217 hrs I was requested to assist the Pullman
               Police Department with a civil situation at 205 NW Windus St.
               Whitcom explained the issue was regarding a custodial exchange
               and the male half, later identified as Michael S Whatley
               (09/27/83) was refusing to turn over the children as what had
               been mutually agreed upon. Whitcom continued and explained
               Whatley was believed to have been growing marijuana in the
               basement and selling without a license. Ofc Olmstead and Ofc
               Tiengo also responded and upon our arrival I contacted a
               female, later identified as Cheyenne R McDaniel (07/13/92), who
               told me the following. McDaniel explained she had arrived at
               the residence to pick up her children, whose father of record
               is Whatley. Whatley was not present and she had been unable to
               reach him. She went on to tell me she wanted to retrieve her
               items but was not having issues with Whatley's mother, later
               identified as Claudell L Whatley (10/03/64). Olmstead, who had
               been standing near me while I spoke with McDaniel confirmed
               Claudell was in the house and went to speak with her while I
               continued to speak with McDaniel. Tiengo during this period of
               time began to speak with McDaniel's mother, later identified as
               Gerri R McDaniel (07/23/68). I continued to speak with McDaniel
               who told me her and Whatley did not currently have a parenting
               plan in place for the children and had been making arrangements
               for approximately 2 months by text message without incident. As
               I continued to speak with her I learned she had also removed a
               mattress from the residence, which she had a key to, for one of
               her children and placed it in the back of her open vehicle. I
               asked Mcdaniel how she entered the house and was told she had
               used her key. I confirmed she no longer resides at the
               residence and we had a discussion regarding residential
               burglary. Around this point she broke down and began crying and
               told me Whatley had all of her money and she had no way of
               trying to obtain legal services and asked me what she should
               do. Before answering that question I told her to remain at the
               vehicle and briefly spoke with Tiengo regarding what he had
               learned. He told me the version of events he had been given by
               Gerri had been similar in nature. I asked him to remain with
               Gerri and McDaniel while I went to speak with Olmstead, who
               later told me the following. Olmstead, who had been speaking

               with Claudell, explained the issues between Whatley and
               McDaniel had been in part a result of McDaniel's desire to move
               with the children to Oregon. Whatley had an attorney and was
               going to court on 06/01/15 to file paperwork in an attempt to
               stop McDaniel from leaving the state with the children. In
               addition to this Olmstead had learned of a history of domestic
               violence. While we were speaking Claudell told me Whatley was
               in the area but was not willing to come back to the house out
               of fear for being in trouble. I explained there were no current
               orders in place from what I had been told, and Claudell
               confirmed this, and asked her to try and have him call her. She
               sent Whatley a text message asking him to call and while I
               returned to speak with McDaniel, Whatley called and was
               speaking with Olmstead. I returned a short time later and
               Olmstead told me the vehicle currently being driven by McDaniel
               had recently been purchased by Whatley and he now wanted it
               back. I asked Tiengo to run the vehicle registration and it
               returned to an individual named Kelly M Roberts from Spokane,
               not Whatley. At hearing this I returned to speak with McDaniel
               and ask her about the vehicle. She confirmed the vehicle had
               been purchased by Whatley, but she had been using it for
               several months now. I returned to Olmstead and told him what I
               had learned regarding the vehicle and had him ask Whatley who
               Roberts was. Whatley explained he had purchased the vehicle and
               I spoke with him a short time later. During this conversation I
               asked him about the ignition keys for the vehicle also
               registered to McDaniel. He told me the truck was his work
               vehicle and he was not going to give it to her. I explained she
               had a legal right to it as a registered owner. After a lengthy
               conversation it was decided he would allow McDaniel to leave
               with the Dodge in question and not take the truck as long as
               she returned it prior to 1700 hrs. After speaking with Whatley
               I went and spoke with McDaniel. Initially she was resistant to
               this and after a conversation about this situation she told me
               she would have the vehicle returned by 1700 hrs on 05/31/15. I
               gave her a domestic violence packet and pointed out the phone
               numbers for ATVP and told her they might be able to provide her
               with assistance with the upcoming issues regarding the children
               and encouraged her to call. She told me she had received the
               packet previously and I again encouraged her to call them and
               see what assistance they may be able to provide. I then
               returned to speak with Olmstead who told me he had spoken with
               Claudell regarding the marijuana issue raised and learned they
               had a license to grown and sell. He had asked for and received
               permission to see the grow and later told me he had seen
               approximately 10 plants and three licenses posted on the wall.
               Tiengo later photographed one on them and it was forwarded to
               Sgt Hargraves to pass along to Det Germer for further follow
               up. A short time later McDaniel and Gerri drove off and
               Olmstead, Tiengo, and I cleared. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               31st day of May, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               vehicle 1. NARRATIVE: On 05-31-15 at approximately 1325 hours I
               was dispatched to a non-injury collision on Spokane St. near
               Campus St. Dispatch advised someone had sideswiped the
               complainant's, Jason R. Esplin (DOB 09-25-82), parked vehicle
               and left a note on the windshield. I responded to the area. I
               contacted Esplin, the owner of the Pontiac Grand Am (ID Lic.
               #4BB2559). I could see the right front tire was up on the
               sidewalk, and the driver's side mirror was hanging from the
               vehicle. Esplin told me he parked his vehicle at about 1000
               hours, and when he returned at about 1323 hours he noticed his
               vehicle had been damaged. Esplin said there was a note
               underneath his windshield wipers. Esplin showed me the note.
               One side of the note said, "sorry, please call me". The other
               side had the name Fanhe Meng, and phone number 509-339-4410.
               Esplin showed me the parking spot he had parked his Pontiac in.
               The Pontiac had been pushed about five feet from it's original
               spot, and the front right tire was up on the sidewalk. There
               appeared to be about a three foot long skid mark from the
               pontiac's front left tire. I had Esplin show me the rest of the
               damage. The front right rim was scrapped up, with possible
               damage to his tire. His front bumper was cracked in the center
               under the license plate. The left and right side of the bumper

               was cracked as well. However, Esplin thinks the damage on the
               left and right side of the bumper may have been old. The left
               rear quarter panel was dented and damaged. The left rear door
               was dented and damaged with multiple scrapes. Also, the left
               rear door will no longer open. The front driver's side door was
               dented and damaged with multiple scrapes. Also, the driver's
               side door will only open halfway. The Estimated total damage to
               the Pontiac was $4,000.00. I had Esplin call the number on the
               note. Esplin told the person there was a note left on his
               vehicle and he wanted to meet up to exchange insurance
               information. The person apologized to Esplin, and said he would
               be there in a few minutes. A few minutes later a white, 2003
               Jeep Liberty (WA Lic. #ATK8396) arrived on scene. A couple of
               males exited the vehicle and walked over to Esplin and I. The
               two males were later identified as Fanhe Meng (DOB 10-26-90)
               and Hua Deng (DOB 06-25-89). I asked who was driving the
               vehicle when they collided with Esplin's vehicle. Meng told me
               he was driving. Deng told me he was teaching Meng how to drive.
               I asked Meng if he had been driving the Jeep when he hit
               Esplin's vehicle, and he said yeah. I asked Meng and Deng if
               anyone else was in the vehicle, they both said no. I asked if
               either of them were injured, and they both said no. Meng handed
               me his driver's license and told me he just had an Instruction
               Permit. Deng handed me his valid driver's license. I asked Meng
               to tell me what happened. Meng told me he was traveling
               westbound on Campus St. and then made a left hand turn onto
               Spokane St. heading southbound. Meng said he was in his lane
               and then drifted into the side of the Pontiac. Meng told me he
               scraped along the entire side of the Pontiac. I asked Meng if
               he hit anything else, and he said no. I asked Meng how fast he
               was traveling, and he said around 20 mph. I asked Meng if they
               were both wearing seatbelts, and he said yes. I asked Meng if
               the airbag deployed, and he said no. I asked Meng to show me
               the damage to his Jeep. Meng showed me his Jeep and his front
               right quarter panel had been dented and scratched from the
               collision. I estimated the total damage to be 500.00. The
               blacktop was dry, and it was sunny out. Digital photos were
               taken of the damaged vehicles and the scene, and have been
               downloaded to Spillman. I exchanged information between Esplin
               and Meng. Neither vehicle needed a tow. No infractions or
               citations were issued. No further investigation. Sector PTCR
               has been completed. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 1st day of June, 2015
               in Pullman, Washington. _______________________________________
