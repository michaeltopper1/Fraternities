    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: DBT/321 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2459 SYNOPSIS: Officers were dispatched
               to the report of a highly intoxicated subject near the woods on
               N. Fairway Rd. Subject had a warrant for disorderly conduct out
               of Spokane County. Subject was arrested on the warrant and
               driven to Spokane County where he was turned over to a Deputy.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Joseph A. Cole/02-05-86
               Arrested/Transported Warrant #B00079126 2. NARRATIVE: On 05-19-
               15 at approximately 0959 hours I was dispatched to the report
               of a highly intoxicated subject on N. Fairway Rd. near the
               woods. Dispatch advised the complaint, Jamie R. Kinley (DOB 12-
               29-76), was on the phone with the subject and he said he wants
               to be taken into custody to get help. Dispatch advised the
               subject was Joseph A. Cole (DOB 02-05-86) and that he has valid
               warrant out Spokane County. Sgt. Jacobson, Cpl. Daniels, and I
               responded. While we were en route, Dispatch called Cole on the
               phone. Cole told Dispatch he is on probation and he has been
               drinking a lot today. Mary Shaw is Cole's Probation Officer.
               Cole also told Dispatch that he had a box cutter on him.
               Dispatch advised Cole was getting agitated because we were not
               there yet. Dispatch said Cole then said "I don't think I have
               enough strength to fight them". We all arrived on scene
               shortly. We contacted Cole standing on the sidewalk on N.
               Fairway near the Turf Farm sign. Cole had his cell phone in his
               hand and started to put his hands up. Cpl. Daniels told him he
               could hang up his cell phone. Cole went down to his knees, and
               Cpl. Daniels asked him if he could put his hands behind his
               back, and he did. I handcuffed Cole (double locked). I told him
               he was not under arrest he was just being detained. Cpl.
               Daniels advised Cole he was being audio and video recorded. As
               I began to frisk Cole for weapons, Cpl. Daniels asked him if we
               could take everything out of his pockets, and he said yeah.
               Cole just wanted to make sure everything went into his
               backpack. I removed the box cutter and other various things
               inside Cole's pockets and placed the items in his backpack.
               Cpl. Daniels contacted Mary Shaw on the phone. She told Cpl.
               Daniels to have Cole take a PBT, but she was unable to pick him
               up. Cpl. Daniels used her PBT (Serial #049029), and Cole blew a
               0.172. I placed Cole in the back of my patrol car. All of
               Cole's property was placed in the trunk of my patrol car. Cpl.
               Daniels called Dispatch to see if Spokane County would take
               Cole on the Disorderly Conduct warrant (#B00079126) if we
               transported Cole to the county line. Dispatch advised Spokane
               County would send a Deputy to meet us half way to pick up Cole.

               I went back to my patrol car and told Cole he was under arrest
               for a Disorderly Conduct warrant out of Spokane County. I read
               Cole his Constitutional Rights from my department issued
               Miranda Warning Card. Cole said he understood his rights, and
               he invoked them. I began to transport Cole to Spokane County,
               but right before we reached the city of Colfax Cole complained
               he had to use the bathroom really bad. I stopped at the Whitman
               County Jail so Cole could use the bathroom. Afterwards, I then
               transported Cole to Babb Rd. just inside of Spokane County. I
               met Deputy Audie from the Spokane County Sheriff's Office.
               Deputy Audie took Cole's sweatshirt and backpack, but said the
               jail would not accept the blanket, pillow, and food he had with
               him. I brought the remaining items of Cole's back with me and
               they were later logged into evidence for safekeeping. Cole was
               released from my custody without further incident. No further
               action. My Vievu camera was activated, and the video has been
               downloaded into the permanent digital evidence folder. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 19th day of May, 2015, in Pullman,

                           PULLMAN              WA 99163

        Time Reported: 00:51
    Time Occurred between: 00:48:36 05/20/15 - 00:51:50 05/20/15

    Narrative: RVWD: 316 / OFC:MTK/336 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2468 SYNOPSIS: Subject was cited and
               released for DWLS 3rd. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               Sibomana Justice 11/24/93 Cite and Release DWLS 5Z0469734 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 05/20/15 at approximately 0045 hours I was parked
               on the side of NE Terreview east of Northwood Dr. monitoring
               traffic on the 2000 blk of Terreview. I saw the defendant's
               vehicle traveling south on Northwood approaching Terreview. I
               watched as the defendant turned right onto Terreview without
               stopping at the clearly posted stop sign. I stopped the
               defendant's vehicle and activated my VieVu camera. I contacted
               the driver and advised him I was recording and the reason for
               the stop. The driver said that he was looking at his phone and
               noticed no cars were around so he just went. I asked the driver
               for his license, registration, and proof of insurance. The
               driver said he lost his license and identified himself verbally
               as Sibomana Justice 11/24/93. I returned to my patrol car and
               ran Justice's information on my MDC and his driver's status
               returned DWLS 3rd with an ignition interlock required (which he
               had). I completed a SECTOR citation for DWLS. I returned to
               Justice and advised him he was under arrest and notified him of
               his right to counsel and reminded him that I was recording. I
               explained the citation to Justice and provided him a copy. I
               told him he was free to go. Justice parked his car and walked
               home. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 20th day of May,
               2015, in Pullman, Washington.
