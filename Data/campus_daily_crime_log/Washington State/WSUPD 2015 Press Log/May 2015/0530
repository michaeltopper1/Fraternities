               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2556 SYNOPSIS: Report of an individual
               who was taking pictures of an individual in public who later
               began to follow her. The subject was contacted and warned about
               his behavior. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Skinner,
               James R (112355) Warned Harassment 2. NARRATIVE: On 053015
               around 0934 hrs I was dispatched to a report of an older white
               male walking a German Sheppard who had been taking pictures of
               the complainant, later identified as Whitney A Stefani
               (043088), along Bishop Blvd and followed her onto campus. I
               contacted Stefani while Ofc Stewart tried to locate the male,
               later identified as James R Skinner (112355). As I began
               speaking with Stefani I heard Stewart locate Skinner in front
               of Rogers Hall. I spoke with Stefani and was told the
               following. Stefani explained she had been walking on Bishop
               Blvd and coming back from Walmart when she noticed Skinner
               taking pictures of her while walking his dog. She asked Skinner
               to not take any pictures of her at which point her explained he
               was doing it for a sociology project he was working on. Stefani
               continued walking West on Main St before crossing onto Stadium
               Way. As she was walking up Stadium Way she explained she
               noticed Skinner had crossed the street as well and was walking
               up the hill as well. Stefani entered the Stephenson Complex key
               and ran up a flight of stairs towards Nevada St before
               continuing back to her residence located in the Yakima
               Apartments. I asked her about the comment Skinner had made to
               her and she told me he had said she needed to run just like the
               rest. I confirmed Skinner had not said anything else after she
               ran up the stairs or as she was walking up Stadium Way and told
               that was correct. At this point I explained simply taking a
               picture of her in a public place was not against the law and
               Stewart was currently speaking with him. I went on to explain I
               would also speak with him about his following her and the
               comment he had made and let her know what the result of the
               conversation was. I cleared a short time later and contacted
               Stewart and Skinner on the lawn in front of Rogers Hall where I
               was told the following. Skinner explained he had been taking
               pictures of Stefani and others in an attempt to document the
               illegal activity going on. He went on to tell us he had
               attempted to contact the Pullman Police Department on 05/29/15
               regarding his findings before traveling to the Whitman County
               Prosecuting Attorney's Office, where he spoke with Dennis
               Tracy. As we continued to speak Skinner began to tell us he had
               worked for the CIA, as well as construction before helping

               investigate what he described as Satan. While we continued to
               speak I had to direct the conversation back to this case
               several times. Once we were speaking again about his
               interaction with Stefani he told us he told us he understood
               how it might have appeared to Stefani before again taking the
               conversation off in another direction. During this tangent he
               described Stefani, who had been wearing a short dress, and
               others as sluts. He continued off on this before changing
               directions and explaining he had come from Florida to Colorado
               before living in Idaho for a time. He also added he has smoked
               marijuana all of his life and was happy Colorado had changed
               their laws. We turned the conversation back to his interaction
               with Stefani again at which point I told him not to follow
               people in the future out of possibly causing alarm. We
               discussed this issue several more times before I asked him if
               he understood what I was asking him. Skinner told us he did
               understand what we were asking him and told us he would return
               to his motorhome, which is parked near Higginson's on Bishop
               Blvd and smoke some marijuana. With that we explained the law
               regarding smoking marijuana to him, which he appeared to
               understand. After speaking with Skinner we told him he was free
               to go and he asked if he should go back to his motorhome. We
               suggested that might be a good idea and he began leaving the
               area in the direction of where he told us his motorhome was
               parked. Stewart and I cleared a short time later at which point
               I contacted Stefani to explain what I had learned. Upon
               reaching her I explained she had done the right thing in
               calling us and discussed the possible concerns with confronting
               an unknown individual. I went on to explain Skinner's taking
               photos of her in a public place was not a violation of law and
               he had denied making any statements while she had been moving
               up the stairs towards Nevada St. We discussed this issue for a
               brief period of time before I told her Skinner had been
               cautioned regarding his behavior and actions. The conversation
               continued for a short time longer before she asked me what she
               should have done. I told her she had done everything correct
               following their initial contact to include contacting the
               police. I went on to tell her the her safety was the most
               important thing and if the same situation were to occur again I
               would want her to again get to a safe location and contact the
               police. Following this we spoke for a short time longer before
               I told her if she had any further questions or concerns she
               could contact me at the phone number listed on the business
               card I had left her. She told me she would and we concluded of
               conversation after which I cleared the call. Following my
               conversation with Stefani I contacted Sgt Hargraves of the
               Pullman Police Department to advise him of our contact and
               where Skinner was residing. He told me he would pass along the
               information to patrol and we concluded our call a short time
               later. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 30th day of May,
               2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               over being stopped for a traffic violation and more so when
               issued an infraction. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               Addison J. Mercer (022594) Issued Infraction Speed 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 053015 at approximately 1832 hours I was on bike
               patrol utilizing radar on Spokane St near Dana Hall. I was
               positioned near the crosswalk. I was in my standard bike patrol
               uniform with Police markings on both the front and back of me.
               I heard a vehicle accelerating behind me and turned north to
               see a southbound vehicle (WA/AAH5735) heading towards my
               position. The vehicle appeared to be exceeding the posted speed
               limit of 20 mph which the vehicle had already passed. The
               vehicle was out front, bu itself, and the next nearest moving
               vehicle was near Honors Hall when the vehicle slowed and
               reached me. The radar was set in "Toward" mode only. I
               activated my handheld radar and the radar confirmed the vehicle
               was exceeding the posted limit and that it was accelerating.
               The speed first registered at 31 mph, then jumped to 35, then
               36, and jumped again to 43 mph where I locked in the speed. My
               feet were stationary and I was not moving. I verified the Scout
               radar's calibration prior to going on patrol. I stepped towards
               the crosswalk to direct the vehicle to the side of the road. I
               observed the front of the car dip significantly to decrease
               speed. The vehicle pulled to the loading area and I directed
               the driver, Addison J. Mercer (022594) to pull into the area
               and stop his vehicle. I also informed him we were being
               recorded. I then requested Ofc. Kirshner to respond to my
               location as I planned on issuing an infraction via Sector. I do
               not have Sector on my bike. Mercer asked how fast he was
               driving beyond 25 mph. I reminded him we were being recorded
               and informed him the speed limit was 20 mph. I informed him he
               was doing 43 mph and that he was very close to being arrested
               due to that speed. He said that was "understandable". I
               requested his current license, registration, and insurance.
               Mercer provided the necessary documents. Mercer then stated
               that his speedometer may be a "little off" and said he thought
               he was driving 25 or 27 mph. He then asked when the radar had
               been last "calculated" which I took to mean the verification of
               the calibration. I told him it was about 35 minutes prior. I
               also showed him the radar screen showing the locked 43 mph. I
               returned Mercer his paper WADL and insurance and told him I
               would be with him in a moment. He then asked why he was waiting
               for. I informed him I was waiting on another officer in order

               to issue him a ticket. I walked away and as I was doing so
               Mercer said something to the effect of "I hope you have a good
               fucking Saturday". I asked him what he had said and he
               commented on how he was only driving 25 mph and how I had
               walked into the street from "nowhere". I clarified about my
               Saturday and he said "hoping it's going well". He reiterated he
               did not understand what he had done. Ofc. Kirshner arrived on
               scene and I informed him Mercer was not pleased. I then
               completed a Sector infraction. The pretty was not set up
               correctly which delayed me temporarily. I then went back to the
               vehicle to explain and issue the infraction. It was difficult
               to do so as Mercer was trying to talk over me. He kept saying
               he would see me soon. He was cited for 30 mph rather than the
               43 mph observed. He was free to go. We both cleared. I later
               returned to the station to verify the calibration of the Scout
               radar post stop. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 31st day of May, 2015, in

               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Shelby R. Vanwinkle 12/14/95 Student
               Conduct MOMVACA/MIP 2. NARRATIVE: On 05/31/15 at approximately
               0035 hours I was monitoring traffic on Merman Drive from Garden
               Ave when I noticed a silver Chevrolet Equnox heading southbound
               on Merman Drive. The vehicle appeared to be traveling faster
               than the posted 25 MPH zone. I activated my handheld radar
               (Decatur Scout 2013) and obtained a reading of 33 MPH. The
               driver's side headlight was also not working. I initiated a
               traffic stop at Valley Road and Brandi Way. I contacted the
               driver, Shelby Rae Vanwinkle 12/14/95, identified myself,
               informed her I was recording, and explained the reason for the
               stop. While standing at the driver's side door I could smell
               the strong odor of intoxicants coming from within the car.
               There was one other occupant in the car other than Vanwinkle. I
               asked Vanwinkle how much she had to drink and she said none. I
               asked Vanwinkle if she would provide a PBT sample to prove she
               had no alcohol in her system and she said she would. I found my
               PBT (Alco-Sensor FST #16805) in working condition. Vanwinkle
               provided a sample of .029. I asked Vanwinkle why she had no
               been honest with me about drinking. I asked Vanwinkle if she
               was willing to do some voluntarily field sobriety tests.
               Vanwinkle said that was fine. After the completion of the field
               sobriety tests I determined that Vanwinkle was not impaired
               enough to arrest. I had Vanwinkle provide another PBT sample.
               This time she provided a sample of .027. I told Vanwinkle that
               because she was very close to the legal minor limit of .020 I
               would not arrest her. However I told Vanwinkle that she would
               be referred to student conduct. Vanwinkle stated she
               understood. Vanwinkle's passenger was too intoxicated to drive
               so Ofc. Whitman parked Vanwinkle's car in the lower Steptoe
               Village lot. Once the car was parked the keys were returned to
               Vanwinkle and we cleared. END OF REPORT I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
