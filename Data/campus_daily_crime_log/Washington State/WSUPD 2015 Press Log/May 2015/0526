    Narrative: RVWD: 316 / OFC:BEJ/314 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #:15-W2525 SYNOPSIS: WSUPD received complaints
               concerning the traffic revision due to construction on Stadium
               Way. I observed the area and found traffic moving efficiently.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 26 May
               2015 at about 1100 hours, LT Larsen stated WSUPD had received
               complaints concerning the traffic revision for the construction
               on Stadium Way. I was told the complaint was people were
               confused with the stop signs covered on North Fairway Lane and
               the stop sign placed on North Fairway at North Fairway Lane. I
               went and sat on North Fairway Lane at the Coliseum to observe
               the intersection. During this time about 300 vehicles went
               through the intersection. Less then twenty vehicles seemed
               confused with the traffic revision. I made one traffic stop for
               a vehicle which didn't stop for the stop sign on North Fairway
               at North Fairway Lane. The driver stated he saw the road closed
               sign, didn't see any vehicles coming from the south so just
               turned right without stopping for the stop sign. He stated he
               saw the stop sign and understood he was suppose to stop for it.
               There doesn't appear to be any major problems with the traffic
               revision at the location which generated the complaint. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this ____ day of _____________, 2015, in
               Pullman, Washington. _______________________________________
