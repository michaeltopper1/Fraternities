               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 05/17/15 at about 0020 hrs I
               heard Pullman PD requested a unit to assist with a suicidal
               subject. I responded and contacted the complainant at Cougar
               Towers Apartment 6. The complainant, Megan R. Neal (051715),
               who told me her boyfriend, Alexander R. Lanz (032892), was in
               town visiting her because of her birthday. Lanz had been
               drinking heavily and has a history of depression and trying to
               hurt himself. She said he was recently released from jail and
               cut himself after being released. She also said he gets even
               more emotional and prone to hurting himself when he drinks. She
               did not know why he wanted to hurt himself that night but he
               tried to jump off her balcony at her apartment. She said she
               had to grab him and hold him back from jumping over the
               railing. I relayed some information regarding Lanz's clothing
               and direction of travel to Officer McNannay, who was looking
               for him. Neal was concerned that Lanz would be angry because
               she called the police. I explained to her he was not going to
               be arrested but if he was located he would be transported to
               the hospital to speak with a counselor. Officer McNannay
               arrived a little later to speak with Neal. She was instructed
               to call if Lanz returned and we cleared. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 17 day of May, 2015, in Pullman,

               MIP/Providing Liqour NARRATIVE: On 05/17/15 at about 0036 hrs
               Dispatch advised Officer Whitman there were some teachers at
               Beasley Coliseum for the FFA dance that were requesting
               officers respond because there was a group of intoxicated
               students they were dealing with. We arrived and spoke with the
               complainant who advised they learned there was a group of
               students from a particular school who had been drinking. At the
               end of the dance they held those students back to speak with
               them about the issue. While they were speaking with the
               students one of them, Ryan L. Loewke (081198), became very
               disrespectful and "lippy" with his teacher and made a threat.
               Officer Whitman went to speak with the students who were being
               cooperative and I went to speak with Loewke. He did not have
               his ID with him but provided his name and date of birth. As I
               was speaking with him I could smell a very strong odor of
               intoxicants on his breath and noticed he swayed front to back
               as he stood. I also observed he had bloodshot and watery eyes.
               I told him it was clear he was intoxicated and he asked how. I
               told him I worked for a university and deal with drunk people
               on a daily basis. He asked me to breathalyze him. I
               administered a breath test on Alco-Sensor FST#5493 and it
               indicated a BrAC of .133. To which Loewke made a "Whoo" sound,
               as if it was a good or exciting thing. It was clear in speaking
               with Loewke he had no remorse for what he did and did not take
               the situation seriously at all. I returned to speak with the
               teachers to see if Loewke threatened anyone directly. They said
               he was on the phone with his mother and made a comment that he
               was going to hurt someone here, speaking of one of the adults.
               He was talking about his teacher who was "yelling at him" and
               he was going to "slap the shit out of her". I offered to call
               and speak with his mother if they wanted me to and they said
               that would be nice. I contacted Loweke's mother, Michele R.
               Loewke (051566), and told her what was going on. She confirmed
               she spoke on the phone earlier with her son. She also confirmed

               he said something about slapping someone. I explained the
               complete lack of respect her son was showing toward not only me
               but the teachers. I told her I would be forwarding charges to
               the prosecutor's office for MIP Exhibiting. She thanked me for
               the phone call and apologized for her son's behavior. I told
               Loewke I would be forwarding charges to the prosecutor's office
               on him for MIP Exhibiting and they would decided if he would be
               charged in juvenile court. Officer Whitman decided to give the
               other subjects involved warnings for MIP Exhibiting. He left
               with one of the students to retrieve and dispose of some
               alcohol that was still back in their room. The staff then asked
               if I would contact three of the other student's parents to
               reinforce the seriousness of the situation. I did so at their
               request and explained to each parent what had occurred and what
               was being done about the situation. Officer Whitman and I
               cleared. As we were leaving Officer Whitman told me Loewke was
               standing on the corner outside Beasley Coliseum smirking at
               him, continuing to show he was not taking the situation
               seriously at all. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 17 day of

               and could not locate him. Ofc. Myklebust met me at the SRC as
               he thought the suspect may be near a basketball court. We were

               route I observed Ofc. Myklebust locate his suspect and take him
               into custody. I had no contact with the suspect or his
               belongings. Nothing follows. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,

               also warned by PPD in April 2015 for MIP. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Zachary A. Gill (022195) Conduct MIP-
               Exhibiting 2. NARRATIVE: On 051715 at approximately 0105 hours
               I was assisting PPD with another case (15-W2438) and was in the
               SRC parking lot. I observed Zachary A. Gill (022195) stumbling
               towards me and Ofc. Myklebust. Gill was not able to walk in a
               straight line and was unsteady. He appeared to be under 21 yoa.
               I recognized Gill from the CUB and he confirmed that was where
               he worked. I knew he normally did not walk as he currently was.
               I asked if he was 21 and he said he was not. His words were
               labored and slurred. I could smell the odor of intoxicants on
               his breath. He confirmed he had been drinking vodka and was
               coming from B St. He provided a voluntary breath sample of
               .171. I told him he would be referred to Student Conduct. I
               offered him a courtesy ride home with the caveat that he would
               be in handcuffs. We proceeded to drive north on N Fairway and
               encountered Ofc. Myklebust contacting the suspect he was
               looking for. I got Gill out of the car and handcuffs. I told
               him he could wait or go home. Before I could assist Ofc.
               Myklebust other PPD officers arrived so I continued to take
               Gill home without incident. Refer to Student Conduct. Nothing
               follows. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 17th day of May, 2015, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer
