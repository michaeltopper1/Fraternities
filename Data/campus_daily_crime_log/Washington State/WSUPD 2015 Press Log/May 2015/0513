               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2379 SYNOPSIS: Subject reported she
               tried sending a package to her sister, but sent it to her old
               address at Chief Joseph. Officer was able to locate the package
               and deliver it to the proper location. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 05-13-15 at approximately 0925
               hours dispatch advised the complaint is trying to retrieve a
               package that was delivered to the wrong location. Dispatch
               advised the complaint, Brandie L. Rita (DOB 09-15-88), was
               requesting phone contact. At approximately 0930 hours I called
               and spoke with Brandie. Brandie told me she sent a package to
               her sister, Shantel K. Rita (DOB 05-15-95), to her old address
               at Chief Joseph #A22. Brandie told me she reported it to USPS,
               but there was nothing they could do. She said the package
               arrived on 04-09-15 at about 1239 hours. Brandie said the
               package was put in a parcel locker and a key needed to be used
               to open it. She said the package contained two scarves and an
               adult onesie with a pug on it. I told Brandie I would try and
               locate the package for her. At about 0922 hours I went to Chief
               Joseph #A22 and tried knocking on the door, but nobody
               answered. I called WSU Residence Life and asked who lives at
               Chief Joseph #A22. They told me Tucker D. Chandler (DOB 02-26-
               92) lives there. I called Chandler on the phone and asked if
               the package was delivered there, and he said yes. Chandler told
               me he did not know what to do with it. I told Chandler I would
               come and pick it up. I met Chandler at Chief Joseph #A22 at
               about 1139 hours and I picked up the package. I told Chandler
               next time he could return it to USPS if this happens in the
               future. I delivered the package to Shantel at her current
               address, 1915 NE Terre View Dr. #64B. I called Brandie back and
               told her I was able to locate the package and deliver it to her
               sister. No further action. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 14th day of May,

               Backing. Refer to Risk Management. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 05-13-15 at approximately 1318
               hours, I responded to Chinook Apartments near building P for a
               non-injury accident involving a WSU vehicle. I contacted the
               dirver, Dakota Chatelain, who had been backing out of parking
               space with a large cargo box truck and struck a parked car. He
               stated he had not see the vehicle parked behind him. I had
               Whitcom look for the owner of the parked Ford Explorer and he
               arrived a short time later. The owner of the Explorer was Shane
               Wilhelm. I provided him with a case number and explained how to
               file a claim with Risk Management. He stated he understood. I
               photographed both vehicles. The Explorer had extensive damage
               to the rear including the rear window being completely
               shattered. The box truck had a large lift gate on the back of
               it which had been folded up. It appeared to have some scuff
               marks only. Dakota and his supervisors stated they would check
               later to make sure there was no damage to lift. I gave Dakota
               the case number as well and they helped apply some plastic to
               the rear of Shane's Explorer to keep the rain out. I advised
               Dakota I would issue him a verbal warning for improper backing.
               He stated he understood. I cleared. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 13th day of

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2392 SYNOPSIS: Report of a sick resident
               at Orton Hall. She was transported to PRH via ambulance.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 05-13-
               15 at about 2058 hours I heard Pullman Fire being dispatched to
               a sick person at Orton Hall. Whitcom advised that there was a
               sick female in the 10th floor women's restroom. I arrived on
               scene and contacted the female who was laying on the floor. She
               described intense pain in her abdomen. I waited with her until
               medics arrived. She asked to be taken to the hospital and
               wanted her wallet and keys out of her room. She gave me
               permission to go in her room and get those items for her, which
               I did. I secured her room, Orton 1021, and cleared. I did not
               identify the patient. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 14th day of May,
               2015, in Pullman, Washington.
