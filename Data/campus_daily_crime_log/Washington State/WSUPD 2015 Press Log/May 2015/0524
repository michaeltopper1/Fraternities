               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2509 SYNOPSIS: Subject wanted to report
               he lost his wallet while on campus today. Officer responded and
               a report was taken. No suspects or leads at this time. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 05-24-15 at
               approximately 1524 hours I was dispatched to the report of a
               lost wallet in the area of Martin Stadium, located at 1775 NE
               Stadium Way. Dispatch advised the complainant, Garrett E.
               Scholl (DOB 10-16-91), was outside the front lobby of the
               Public Safety Building for contact. I arrived on scene and
               contacted Scholl. I asked Scholl what happened. He told me he
               lost his wallet sometime today. Scholl thinks he lost it
               somewhere in the area around Martin Stadium. He told me he
               parked his car in the green lot in front of the Biotechnology
               Life Sciences building at about 1300 hours, and he remembers
               his wallet being in his left pocket. Scholl said he noticed his
               wallet was missing so he retraced his steps, and was unable to
               locate it. Scholl came to report his wallet missing at about
               1522 hours. Scholl told me his wallet was a dark brown,
               Columbia bi-fold. He said the Columbia logo was in the bottom
               right hand corner of the wallet. He estimated the wallet to be
               $30.00. Scholl said the wallet contained the following items:
               AAA card, two (2) student ID cards, two (2) debit cards, two
               (2) credit cards, $15 cash, and his Montana Driver's License.
               One of his student ID cards was from the University of
               Colorado, and the other was from University of Wisconsin
               (Platteville). Scholl said one of the debit cards was from US
               Bank and the other from Milledgeville State Bank in Illinois.
               He said both of the cards have his names on them. I was unable
               to get any card numbers. Scholl said one of the credit cards
               was his personal one from US Bank and the other one was a Chase
               Freedom card which belongs to his company. Scholl said he the
               business card contains his name as well as his company's name
               "Jackson Contractors". I was unable to get any card numbers.
               Scholl said he thinks he had two (2) $5 bills and (5) $1 bills
               in his wallet. I told Scholl he needs to the call the banks as
               soon as possible and make sure to cancel his cards, and he said
               he would. He said he already checked all the accounts and there
               had been no fraudulent charges. I cleared the scene. No
               suspects or leads at this time. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 25th day of
               May, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.
