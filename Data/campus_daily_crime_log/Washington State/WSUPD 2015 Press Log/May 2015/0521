               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2493 SYNOPSIS: Report of a reported lost
               permit being displayed in another vehicle. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 05-21-15 at
               approximately 1339 hours, I responded to CUE parking garage for
               the report of a permit which had been reported lost to WSU
               Parking Services, being displayed in a vehicle. I arrived and
               observed the permit #OR30108082115 was displayed in vehicle
               WA/AIP4451. According to Parking Services, the owner of the
               permit who reported it lost on 11-25-14 to them was Dawei Lin.
               The owner of the vehicle it was being displayed in is TingTing
               Liu. I could see both subjects reside at the same address. I
               attempted to call all of the phone numbers listed for both
               subjects, but none of the phone numbers work. Parking Services
               placed a wheel lock on the vehicle, per their policy. I cleared
               and was later contacted by Parking Services to tell me Tingting
               was in their lobby. I responded and contacted Tingting. She
               stated her boyfriend, Dawei, had just moved recently and when
               he did, he found the permit and gave it to her to use. She
               stated she was unaware he had reported the permit was lost. I
               advised her I would issue her a verbal warning for Theft of
               Services. I advised her the rules of not transferring parking
               permits and she stated she understood. She stated she would
               work with Parking to get her vehicle released. I cleared. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 21st day of May, 2015, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer
