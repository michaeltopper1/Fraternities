    Narrative: RVWD: BEJ/314 OFC: DBT/321 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2397 SYNOPSIS: Report of a suspicious
               male following a group Future Farmers of America (FFA) girls to
               Beasley Coliseum. Officer checked the area and could not locate
               the male. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 05-14-15 at approximately 0822 hours I was dispatched to the
               report of a suspicious male in the area of Cougar Way and
               Stadium Way. Dispatch advised the complaint, Lisa O. Feltis
               (DOB 06-08-59), saw an older male following a group of Future
               Farmers of America (FFA) girls and calling after them. The
               caller advised the girls were crossing from Streit Perham and
               to the track, before walking to Beasley. The caller could not
               tell if the male was welcomed or not. Dispatch said the male
               was in his 30's or 40's with graying hair. He was wearing a
               button up shirt, and could possibly be one of the dad's but
               they were unsure. I responded and drove around the area. I
               could not locate any suspicious males in the area. I went to
               Beasley Coliseum where the FFA Convention was being held. I
               spoke with one of the ladies at the FFA Check in desk. She told
               me none of the girls have reported it. When I described the
               male to her, she said that it was probably one of their
               advisors or one of the dad's. She told me she would notify the
               police department if she heard anything else. I cleared the
               area. No further action. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 14th day of May,
               2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               males. I went and contacted the two males. Ruger J. Lillengreen

               An employee of the CUB brought a wallet (Obey) brand to the WSU
               PD to be processed in the Lost and Found department. The wallet
               contained ID issued to Connor Daniel Lazares. I contacted Mr.
               Lazares in Spillman, called and left him a message. He called
               me back, seemed confused that I had property that belonged to
               him but said he would come and claim it after his class was
               over. The wallet contained $110.00 in cash so I took it back to
               Maeleen, Evidence Tech to verify the amount of money in the
               wallet. She noted the wallet contained more than one ID leading
               her to believe Mr. Lazares may be using more than one ID to
               show that he is older. When Mr. Lazares shows up to claim his
               ID we will have an officer return it to him. I certify and

               2. NARRATIVE: On 05-14-15 at about 2104 hours I was dispatched
               to the report of a parking problem at the Valley Road
               Playfields. Facops had called to report that there was a white
               Dodge truck that was parked in such a way that they could not
               close the gate to the playfields, causing a security concern
               overnight. I responded to the area and saw a white 2012 Dodge
               Ram truck parked in a legal parking stall, near the gate of the
               playfields. I saw that because of the size of the gate, it
               would not pass in front of the truck to close. I tried to find
               information on the responsible for the truck but was unable to.
               I called Facops and explained to them what I had found out. I
               told them that I would send an email to patrol asking for extra
               patrols in the area. I also advised that they may want to put
               up a "compact cars only" sign for that parking stall so this is
               not a problem in the future. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               preparing for work and saw a post on a phone application called
               YikYak which is an anonymous posting site where people can post
               something and receive comments/responses. The post that caught
               my attention said "Anyone looking for bud? Have quality stuff
               for sale". I know based on my experience that Bud is a slang
               word used for marijuana. One person had already responded
               asking if the subject would deliver. I responded saying "I can
               come to u, hook me up". He asked for my snapchat name. Snapchat
               is another anonymous phone application where people can send
               messages/pictures back and forth and the communications are
               automatically deleted after a short period of time. I created a
               fake snapchat account with the user name Killgore77 and posted
               the information for a short time on YikYak before the original
               post was removed and no longer visible. A couple minutes later
               a subject with the username "JD" added my snapchat account and
               asked if I was looking for Bud. I said yes and asked what he
               had. He sent me a message asking if I wanted a specific amount
               and told me he had " platinum girl scout cookies, cotton candy
               kush, green crack, and harlequin at the moment". I told him
               "Kush sounds good u got half i can buy? whats your price?"
               (half referring to half an ounce). JD responded "Definetly can
               do a half, so the cotton candy kush right? the half for $100,
               ounce $200. Also, are you the guy who said he could pick up?" I
               responded "half sounds good. and yeah i can pick it up. Unless
               u feel better meeting somewhere neutral." He responded " I can
               meet up with you at emerald downs. that's the complex I am
               staying at. There's a laundry place right in front of building
               K. Would you want to meet there in about 30-40 mins? I'm omw
               home." I said "sounds good. I'll hit the atm and meet u there.
               how will i know u?" and he responded "I'll be wearing shorts
               and a black California sweater." I gave him the description of
               what I would be wearing and that was the end of the snapchat
               conversation. Due to time constraints and time of day I went to
               an ATM in the CUB and removed $100.00 from a personal bank
               account. The money was in $20.00 bills and the serial numbers
               of the bills were photographed before the transaction took
               place. The serial numbers were: JJ72656265A, MB30656790B,
               IL45808810E, JJ36628136A, and ID56502488C. At about 2130 hrs I

               went to Emerald Downs in plain clothes and on a personally
               owned motorcycle. Officer Jones was parked in an unmarked Ford
               F150 a little further down the parking lot and Officer Edwards
               was in a marked patrol car across Valley Rd. at Pullman Family
               Medicine. About 1-2 minutes after parking in front of the K,
               building a Hispanic male approached me wearing a black
               University of California sweatshirt and cargo shorts. I asked
               if he was JD and he said yeah. He introduced himself as Jose.
               He asked if I would go to the laundry room with him, which was
               across the parking lot, because that's where his "stuff" was.
               The male was later identified as Jose A. Dominguez-Rios
               (061495). I followed Dominguez-Rios into the laundry room and
               he removed a plastic ziploc bag from another reusable grocery
               type bag in the room. The ziploc contained what appeared to be
               about half an ounce of what I recognized to be marijuana. I
               gave him the 5 $20 dollar bills listed above and he told me if
               I ever needed more or knew anyone else who needed some to get
               in touch with him. He said the marijuana "we" have is medical
               stuff from California. I asked if he brought it all the way up
               and he said he and his roommates did. Dominguez-Rios began to
               exit the laundry room in front of me. Once we were outside I
               told him there was one more thing he would want to see. He
               turned around and I showed him my police badge and advised him
               he was under arrest. I placed him in handcuffs (double locked)
               and Officer Jones drove up to assist. Officer Jones double
               locked the cuffs and I advised Dominguez-Rios he was being
               recorded because Officer Jones had a body camera activated. I
               was not wearing a camera at the time as there is not a hidden
               place to wear one. I read Dominguez-Rios his rights from a pre-
               printed card. He stated he understood his rights and verbally
               waived them to speak with me. I made sure it was clear to
               Dominguez-Rios he knew he was under arrest for delivery of a
               controlled substance. Dominguez-Rios was searched incident to
               arrest. In his left front pocket he had $400.00 cash in $10 and
               $20 dollar bills, which I know are common denominations for
               drug transactions. He also had the $100.00 cash in $20 bills
               that I gave him. Officer Jones confirmed the serial numbers
               were the same as the ones in the photographs taken before the
               transaction took place. They were separated from the rest of
               the cash that Dominguez-Rios had with him. I asked Dominguez-
               Rios how much more marijuana was back in his apartment. He told
               me there wasn't any. I told him he offered to sell me several
               different kinds of marijuana and up to an ounce. He said he did
               not have anything else in his apartment. He told me he lived in
               K1. I asked if anyone else was in the apartment and he told me
               there might be a couple guys who were planning on subletting
               the place from him there, he was not sure. I told Dominguez-
               Rios I would speak with him more later and Officer Edwards
               transported him to the Pullman Police Department holding
               facility. Sergeant Griffin and I went to KTH1, and knocked on
               the door. Two males, later identified as Jarrad P. Rexford
               (092585) and Michael J. Tracy (052693), answered the door and I
               asked if they knew Jose. They told me they were subletting the
               place from a hispanic male and they thought his name was Jose.
               They said they had only seen him a couple times as they were

               very busy with summer session classes. I described what
               Dominguez-Rios was wearing and they confirmed that was him. I
               advised him Dominguez-Rios was under arrest for selling a
               controlled substance and asked if they would grant permission
               for me to search the common areas of the apartment and their
               rooms so I could make sure there was no marijuana in those
               areas. They agreed. I read them a Ferrier warning and they said
               they understood. They stood just outside the door with Sergeant
               Griffin while I went in and looked around the apartment. I saw
               no indications of marijuana use in the main living areas or in
               Tracy or Rexford's rooms. I smelled at the door to the room
               they indicated was Dominguez-Rios' room and could smell a
               slight odor of marijuana coming from the room. I thanked
               Rexford and Tracy for their cooperation and advised them not to
               go in Dominguez-Rios' room and to call if anyone arrived to try
               and get anything from his room. They said they would. I went to
               the WSU Police Department where I made photo copies of the
               serial numbers from the 5 $20 bills that belonged to me before
               I recovered them. The photo copies have been added to the case
               file along with the photographs taken before the transaction.
               The money Dominguez-Rios had with him before the transaction as
               well as his cell phone were secured in an evidence locker. I
               changed from plain clothes into my normal duty uniform and went
               to the Pullman Police Department. I had Dominguez-Rios step
               into an interview room and advised him he was being recorded. I
               read him his Constitutional Rights again from a card and he
               signed the card stating they were read to him. He also signed
               stating he was waiving his rights. I asked Dominguez-Rios how
               long he had been selling marijuana. He told me he has only been
               selling marijuana for a week. He said he did not have any money
               to pay for school and he needed to pay for summer courses. I
               asked if his roommates got him into selling marijuana because
               he mentioned them earlier and he said "something like that" and
               that he had not even smoked marijuana until recently. He
               admitted about $80.00 of the cash he had with him was from
               selling marijuana. He claimed he had the rest was because he
               was supposed to return home in about a week. I asked where the
               rest of the marijuana was since he had offered to sell me an
               ounce and gave a price. He told me he just said that because he
               wanted to see if people were willing to buy more and if I had
               asked to buy that much he would not have been able to sell it
               that night. He told me he thought he only had a couple nuggets
               of marijuana in his room that he had been smoking himself. He
               told me he has only sold marijuana three times previously. He
               said he got his marijuana from someone in Pullman who they met
               at school. He did not know his name and said he contacted him
               through snapchat when he needed to get marijuana. I explained
               to Dominguez-Rios what would be happening from that point
               forward and placed him back in a holding cell while I completed
               a booking sheet. I later returned and transported him to the
               Whitman County Jail for booking. After returning to the WSU
               Police Department I logged the marijuana and cash seized as
               evidence. The marijuana was tested using a NARK presumptive
               test for Marijuana. The test was positive for the presence of
               marijuana. I completed forfeiture paperwork for the cash as

               it was fireworks. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 05/15/15 at about 0017 hrs Dispatch advised of a
               subject reporting hearing what he thought might be gunshots
               near Carpenter Hall. Officer Jones, Sergeant Griffin and I
               responded. Officer Jones and I contacted the complainant, Devon
               L. Plewman (010593), who told us he heard 4 or 5 loud bangs
               come from the area of Thompson Flats. He was in room 101
               Carpenter Hall at the time he heard the noises. Officer Jones,
               Sergeant Griffin, and I searched the area. Officer Jones and I
               located several used bottle rocket type fireworks at the top of
               the hill near the Communication Addition building. The ground
               was wet from the sprinklers being on recently but the fireworks
               were not wet, indicating they were recently used. The sounds
               would have been consistent with what Plewman reported. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
