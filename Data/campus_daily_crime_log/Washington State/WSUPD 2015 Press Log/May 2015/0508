               NARRATIVE: On 050815 at approximately 0850 hours, I was
               dispatched to contact Andrew T. Storfer who reported a
               suspicious email. Upon contact, Storfer told me the following.
               On 050715 at 0800 hours, he held a Biology 102 final exam in
               Todd Hall room 116. At approximately 1900 hours, he received an
               email from Abdulrahan A. Albarraq advising that he missed the
               final because he thought it was at 2000 hours not 0800 hours.
               Storfer responded to the email stating there was nothing he
               could do to help Albarraq and that he was sorry. Albarraq
               responded to his email at 0226 hours on 050815 stating, "You
               got me fucked up tonight doctor, have a good one!" Storfer
               stated he believed that the email indicated that he got drunk,
               but he wanted the email documented any ways because he believed
               it could be taken multiple ways. Documentation only. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.

               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Campos, Danika L. (062595) Arrested/Released
               Unlawful sale of wild game. 2. NARRATIVE: On 050715 at
               approximately 1600 hours, I received a phone call from Douglas
               King who works for Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife.
               King asked me to look into having an intern check the WSU
               Facebook Free and For Sale page to see if there was a person
               selling wild game on the internet. I had remembered earlier in
               the day that WSUPD Intern Nicholas Jones told me about someone
               selling deer meat on the internet, so I contacted Jones and
               asked if he could get screen shots of the facebook page the
               meat was posted on and email them to me. At approximately 1628
               hours, Jones emailed me several screen shot pictures of the
               facebook posting indicating that Campos was selling 16 packages
               of ground venison for $2 per pound. I forwarded the emails to
               King. On 050815, I received a voicemail from King asking if
               Jones would be willing to see if he could purchase any deer
               meat Campos has left. At approximately 0922 hours, Jones
               messaged Campos asking if she has any meat left. Campos stated
               she had one and a half pounds left. Jones stated he would like
               to buy the meat and she told him that he was leaving in
               approximately 20 minutes and wouldn't be back until Sunday
               (051015). Jones stated he would be gone by then and asked if
               she could meet up before she leaves town and she stated she
               could. They arranged to meet in the Dissmores IGA parking lot
               around 1000 hours. They agreed that Jones would pay $3 for the
               pound and a half of deer meat. I responded to US Bank and
               withdrew 3 one dollar bills from my personal account. I
               photocopied the money and gave it to Jones to pay for the meat.
               At approximately 1000 hours, Jones was dropped off in the
               parking lot by Sgt. Griffin driving his personal vehicle and I
               positioned myself in an unmarked police Ford F150 pickup in the
               parking lot. Jones positioned himself at the vending machines
               outside the grocery store and messaged Campos where he was at.
               At approximately 1015 hours, I noticed a green Jeep Cherokee
               pull into the parking lot with a female driving. When she
               exited her car, I noticed she was carrying two packages that
               appeared to be the deer meat. I began recording on my personal
               body camera and directed it in the area of Jones. Campos
               approached Jones and handed him the two packages of deer meat
               and Jones gave her the $3. I approached Campos as she was

               getting in her car and asked her to step out of her car. As I
               was appproaching her car, I attempted to put my body camera
               back on my uniform and it accidentally shut off without me
               realizing it. Campos exited her vehicle and I asked her if she
               knew why I was contacting her. She stated she didn't. I
               explained that Jones was a member of the WSU Police Department
               and that WDFW asked us for an agency assist because she was
               unlawfully selling wild game. Campos asked if she was under
               arrest and I told her she was. I told her that I had
               photocopies of the three dollars that she was given and she
               handed it back to me. I took the money and handed the money and
               photocopies to Sgt. Griffin who confirmed that the three dollar
               bills that Campos had matched the photocopies that I took
               before the incident. I told Campos to turn around and place her
               hands behind her back and she complied. I explained that she
               was under arrest and handcuffed her wrists (DL). I read Campos
               her constitutional rights and she told me she understood them.
               Campos voluntarily waived her rights and agreed to talk to me.
               I asked her where she shot the deer and she stated she shot it
               in LaCrosse, WA. I asked if she had a valid hunting license and
               she told me she did. She stated she had too much meat and
               decided to sell what she couldn't eat. I asked her how much she
               sold and she told me between 10 and 15 packages. I asked her if
               she knew she wasn't supposed to be selling deer meat and she
               told me she had someone state that on the message board that
               she posted the meat for sale on. I advised Campos that I was
               going to release her from the contact, and that I was going to
               forward my case to Douglas King with WDFW who would handle the
               charging of the case. I removed the handcuffs from Campos and
               she was released. I contacted King and he told me he would come
               by the WSU Police Department and pick up the meat and
               photocopies of the money used. I returned to the WSU Police
               Department and placed the meat in the evidence room freezer. I
               later completed processing the meat and signed it over to Ofc.
               King. Forward case to WDFW Ofc. King. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Boyd/335 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2302 SYNOPSIS: Subject was stopped for a
               traffic violation. The vehicle smelled like marijuana. A
               consent search of the vehicle was performed and a small amount
               of marijuana seized. Charges forwarded to the Whitman County
               Prosecutor. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Latisha
               R.K. Cain/060296 Fwd. Chgs. Poss. Marijuana 2. NARRATIVE: On
               05/09/15 at about 0031 hrs I was driving eastbound on Cougar
               Way approaching Stadium Way when I noticed a vehicle that was
               driving westbound on Orchard Dr. toward Stadium Way. The
               vehicle caught my attention because we both reached Stadium Way
               at about the same time. I began to make a left turn, northbound
               on to Stadium Way, and the suspect vehicle (WA ASG5943), made a
               right turn, northbound on Stadium Way. The suspect vehicle
               turned improperly, turning into the inside northbound lane on
               Stadium Way, cutting me off and forcing me to stop to avoid a
               collision. I initiated a traffic stop on the vehicle, turning
               on my overhead lights. The vehicle stopped on Lower Dr. just
               off Stadium Way. I contacted the driver, Latisha R.K. Cain
               (060296), and told her the reason for the stop and the stop was
               being recorded. I asked for her driver's license, vehicle
               registration, and proof of insurance. She provided me with her
               driver's license, but could not find her registration or
               insurance. As I was speaking with Cain I could smell the odor
               of marijuana coming from the vehicle. I also observed two green
               stems laying on the dashboard of the vehicle. I recognized the
               stems from my previous experience as being marijuana stems. I
               asked Cain to exit the vehicle and she did so. I asked how much
               marijuana was in the car and she said there was not any. I
               asked why her vehicle smelled like marijuana then and she said
               a friend had been in the vehicle earlier who smoked marijuana.
               She said it was not the friend that was currently in the
               vehicle with her. Cain offered to let me check the vehicle. I
               advised Cain she could change her mind at any time and stop the
               search, or limit the scope of the search to certain parts of
               the vehicle. She said she understood. I had Cain's passenger,
               Siena C. Williams (032796), exit the vehicle. I asked if she
               was aware of any marijuana in the vehicle and she said no. I
               asked what in the vehicle was hers and she indicated a backpack
               and purse on the passenger floorboard were hers. The rear of
               the vehicle, from just behind the front driver's and
               passenger's seats of the vehicle was full to the ceiling with
               all of Cain's possessions. I searched the front driver's and
               passenger area of the vehicle. In the center console of the

               bong bowl with burnt marijuana residue, another smoking device
               with burnt marijuana residue, and the end of a blunt with green
               marijuana inside. I asked Cain where her bong was and she
               looked confused. I showed her the items I found and asked again
               where her bong was since there was a bowl in the vehicle. I
               asked if she was going to be honest with me and tell me how
               much marijuana was actually in the vehicle. She told me she and
               her other friend had smoked the blunt in the vehicle at either
               1500 or 1700 hrs, she could not remember. She said there was no
               other marijuana in the vehicle. I told Cain I would be
               forwarding charges for possession of marijuana to the Whitman
               County Prosecutor's Office. She told me she was leaving the
               country for the summer on Sunday. I told her she needed to
               contact the Prosecutor's Office to tell them what her plans
               were and to coordinate with them what would happen with the
               case. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 09 day of May, 2015,

    Narrative: RVWD:MTK/336 OFC: Boyd/335 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2303 SYNOPSIS: Four subjects were
               contacted after Sergeant Macy observed them damaging a tree in
               front of Northside Hall. Two of the subjects were WSU students
               and two were UW students. All four subjects to be referred to
               student conduct for Malicious mischief and MIP Exhibiting.

               Student Conduct Mal Misch/MIP NARRATIVE: On 05/09/15 at about
               0103 hrs I was turning on to Cougar Way from Stadium Way when I
               heard Sergeant Macy ask if there was anyone on Cougar Way. I
               advised I was and he said there was a group of four males in
               front of Northside Hall who had just been damaging a tree in
               front of Northside Hall. I saw the subjects, and a tree just
               down the sidewalk with a branch hanging down, obviously broken.
               The tree had not been damaged earlier in the evening. I
               contacted the subjects, later identified as Samuel D. Olsen,
               Graham M. Gustafson, Austin J. Riddle, and Michael A. Caliboso.
               I asked what was going on with the tree and one of them said
               they had been "fucking around". I told them damaging the tree
               was malicious mischief and that maintaing/replacing a tree was
               not cheap. As I spoke with them I observed they each had
               bloodshot and watery eyes. They each appeared to be under 21. I
               asked for their ID's and they each provided their driver's
               licenses, which confirmed they were all under 21. I asked if I
               could check their eyes one by one. Each agreed to submit to a
               horizontal gaze nystagmus test. I administered a horizontal
               gaze nystagmus test on each one individually. As I was
               administering the test I was able to smell the odor of alcohol
               on each of their breath. I saw each one had a lack of smooth
               pursuit and a distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum
               deviation. I advised them it was probably not a smart idea to
               be doing things that would draw police attention, especially if
               they were under age and intoxicated. I warned them for
               malicious mischief and MIP exhibiting. I advised them student
               conduct would be advised. Gustafson and Olsen advised they were
               UW students. I told them WSU would notify UW student conduct of
               the incident. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 09 day of

               white male, having silver or grey spiked hair, wearing a button

               lot behind the air supported structure. I was unable to locate
               anyone matching the given description. I contacted Pullman PD
               Officer Myklebust to determine if an alert needed to be sent
               out. He advised the suspect "caressed" a female's butt in the
               bar and she took offense. Officer Myklebust did not believe
               there was any risk to the WSU community at large from the
