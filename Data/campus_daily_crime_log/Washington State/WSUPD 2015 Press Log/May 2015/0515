               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2416 SYNOPSIS: Father requested a
               welfare check on his daughter because he had not heard from her
               today. Officer responded and was able to determine daughter was
               okay. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               05-15-15 at approximately 1044 hours I was dispatched to
               welfare check. Dispatch advised the complainant, Samuel C.
               Ezeonwu (DOB 11-09-59, has not heard from his daughter,
               Chijioke U. Emeka (DOB 09-02-95), today. Dispatch said he
               normally speaks to her three or four times a day. Emeka's cell
               phone was going straight to voicemail, and she was not
               returning his emails. I tried calling Emeka's cell phone, but
               it went straight to voicemail. I tried looking up Emeka's
               address, but there was no apartment number listed. I sent Emeka
               emails at the three email addresses she had listed asking her
               to please get in touch with Ezeonwu. I have attached the emails
               to Spillman. At approximately 1130 hours I called Ezeonwu on
               the phone. I asked him when the last time was he heard from his
               daughter. He told me he spoke with her on the phone on 05-14-15
               at about 1128 hours. Ezeonwu told me he does not know his
               daughter's current address though. He said she was a Resident
               Advisor this past year, but she moved out of the dorm this
               summer. I asked him if she was taking any summer courses, and
               he said yes. I told Ezeonwu I would look up her class schedule
               and try to locate her. I printed off a photo of Emeka and
               looked up her class schedule. At approximately 1140 hours I
               arrived at CUE #412 because it showed she had a Biology class
               getting done at 1145. I went in the classroom and contacted
               Bethany D. Johnston (DOB 03-10-59) who was grading papers.
               Johnston told me she is the professor for the Biology class. I
               told Johnston I was try to locate a student. I showed a picture
               of Emeka to Johnston, and asked if she was in class today.
               Johnston called her by name, and said yes she was. Johnston
               even pointed to the desk she had been sitting in. Johnston said
               Emeka finished her exam early and I just missed her by a few
               minutes. Johnston told me she knows Emeka has been sick all
               week, but she has also been in class everyday this week.
               Johnston sent Emeka an email over ANGEL telling her to please
               get ahold of her father. I thanked Johnston, and I cleared the
               scene. At approximately 1206 hours I called Ezeonwu back and
               told him I spoke with one of Emeka's professors. I told him the
               professor said she had just finished up an exam a few minutes
               ago. I asked him if he still wanted me to try to contact her,
               and he said no. I attached the class schedule and the photo to

               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 051515 at
               approximately 1745 hours I was dispatched to an assault at Nez
               Perce that had occurred in the last 15 minutes or so. It was
               unclear if the parties were separated. Ofc. Jones and I
               responded to apartment C12 and did not hear anything. I knocked
               on the door and Mitchell G. Davis (080793) answered the door.
               He knew why we were there and stated that he had been assaulted
               by his fiancee's roommate. His fiancee is Naomi T. Levine
               (031993) and the roommate is Hannah J. Heintz (062493). He
               allowed us to come in knowing we were recording. He explained
               that Levine had left and that Heintz was upstairs. Ofc. Jones
               went to the backyard to speak with Davis and I spoke with
               Heintz downstairs. I informed Heintz we were being recorded.
               She recounted that Davis had moved and packed up some of her
               belongings in what she felt was an effort to move her out. She
               had recently graduated and had gone home with her family when
               they visited. Heintz stated that Davis was not on the lease but
               had been living at the apartment since they moved in back in
               July/August of 2014. When she got home she got into an argument
               over him moving her things. Levine and Heintz's boyfriend, Juan
               Ramirez (071092), were present. Heintz said that Davis had
               previously taken her vehicle without permission and deflated
               tires of vehicles. At an unknown recent time, Davis had called
               Heintz a "cunt" and a "bitch". I later was given a screenshot
               of Facebook from Ramirez showing Davis referring to Heintz in
               this manner. In the argument Heintz picked up a stuffed animal,
               a dog I believe, and said something to the effect of how would
               Davis like it if she moved his things. She swung the toy over
               her head and hit Mitchell twice with it. He had been sitting on
               the ground in a bean bag chair and evidently did not move. They
               toy was large, unwieldy, and very soft. There were more
               effective items available in the area had Heintz looked to
               inflict harm. Heintz said that both Levine and Ramirez had
               subsequently left. Heintz had begun proceedings with the
               apartment coordinator to have Davis evicted. I then went to
               listen to Ofc. Jones and Davis. Davis refused medical treatment
               and I did not see any signs of injury. He stated he could not
               remember all that happens as he tends to black out. He
               recounted much of what Heintz had told me. However, he felt

               Heintz was moving out so he thought he would be helping her by
               packing some of her things up. Their lease does not expire for
               several weeks. Davis's thoughts seem illogical. Davis confirmed
               he does not have another residence. Davis stated that Ramirez
               had threatened to beat him up because he had called her a cunt
               and bitch. He may have also called her a "motherfucker" as she
               walked back upstairs but I later spoke with Ramirez and he told
               me that Davis accused Ramirez of "fucking" his mother. Davis
               said that Ramirez challenged him to go outside to fight. He
               said he declined and agreed with Ramirez when he called him a
               "pussy". I confirmed with Heintz that Ramirez had threatened to
               beat up Davis for calling her names. She did not believe he had
               challenged him to go outside. I counseled Heintz on Domestic
               Violence Law and provided her with my business card and the DV
               packet. I explained that I could not evict Davis at this time.
               She was going to look into going to Ramirez's apartment but she
               also seemed contact to just go to bed. We cleared and Ofc.
               Jones attempted to contact Levine (see his supplement). I then
               contacted Ramirez and met him at Chief Joseph Apartments. I
               informed him I was recording. We met in the community lounge.
               His rendition of events was mostly the same other than he
               firmly believes Davis is mentally unstable and has acted
               erratic most likely due to drug use. I did not believe Davis
               was impaired when I spoke with him. Ramirez stated he has never
               been in a fight and had not intended to fight Davis but he was
               upset at how Davis was treating a woman. I explained the DV Law
               to him and talked about him threatening Davis. Ramirez
               mentioned Davis deflating the tires of his car. Heintz had
               mentioned Davis admitted doing this about 5 months before.
               Ramirez showed me the Facebook post of Davis calling Heintz a
               bitch and a cunt. He sent me the image and I saved it to the
               case. I referred Ramirez to the ATVP website on his computer. I
               then spoke on Ramirez's phone with Heintz's mother with her
               permission. I explained what I had learned and referred her to
               ATVP as well in case she wanted to assist her daughter. I then
               cleared and returned to Nez Perce to discuss the tire deflation
               issue with Davis. No one was home so I asked Ofc. Jones to
               check when he spoke with Levine. The next day I returned to Nez
               Perce and only spoke with Heintz. She said everything was fine.
               I later spoke with Davis over the phone regarding the deflation
               of the tires. He denied doing it though Heintz said he had
               admitted it to her. She had previously been very honest about
               actions that did not paint her in the best light. I later
               received an email on 051615 at approximately 2027 from Heintz.
               It stated "Hey Officer Petlovany, My name is Hannah Heintz and
               I recently talked to you about the domestic case that happened
               yesterday (May 15th) and Nez Perce apartment C12. First of all,
               i wanted to thank you for your kindness and help towards both
               Juan and I, and my mother over the phone. I think that I have
               tolerated Mitch for far too long now, and have let him get away
               with so many things, because i was too nice to report all the
               things he has done over the year. however, now that it has come
               to this, my family and I are wondering if there is any way to
               report a trespassing case for Mitch entering my room multiple
               times moving my property. (I know that the stealing the car and

               deflating the tires happened too long ago to have any
               repercussions. ) I have pictures on my phone of the things that
               were moved into my room while I was gone over the 5 days. Also,
               I spent most of the day at Juans and came home to shower. I
               noticed Mitch placed both his and Naomis bikes in the center
               when i went to go get a water of the kitchen blocking the path
               to the kitchen (which i have a picture of also). I told Mitch
               before to please keep the bikes outside in the shed, and now i
               know he is doing it to play mind games and try and make me mad.
               So now, i finally want to take action in a justified way. If
               you could give me any information about this or what else I can
               do, my family and I would deeply appreciate it. Thank you for
               your time, Hannah" I corresponded with her via email and she
               decided to bring in a statement the following day. At
               approximately 1606 hours Heintz came to the statement with a
               prepared statement. She later emailed it to me and I saved it
               to the case and placed it in the case file. The statement
               contained incidents back to July 2014. They involved smoking
               marijuana in the house, "inappropriate" drawings", "entering my
               room while on drugs", moving property, and taking food. Heintz
               stated that her mother and grandmother were recommending that
               she bring these issues to me. I inquired more about Davis's
               taking of her vehicle. She believed the event in question took
               place in August of 2014. She thought it had to do with a job
               interview and possibly at a bike shop in Moscow. She stated
               that Davis had never borrowed the vehicle but she had given him
               a few rides. Heintz keeps her car keys on the door knob inside
               her room. She keeps the vehicle locked. Heintz did not see
               Davis in the vehicle. She learned he had used it when she was
               in the kitchen with Levine and Davis returned and placed the
               keys on the table, stating he had used her vehicle. She thought
               this took place early in the afternoon. I asked if Davis had
               permission to use the vehicle from her mother, Desiree C. Past
               (031064) who was most likely the RO of the vehicle. She did not
               believe he would have gotten permission from her mother. I
               later received an email from desireeheintz@yahoo.com on 051715
               at 1903 hours stating: "Hi Michael, Thank you so much for all
               of your help. I at no time last July or August, gave Mitch
               Davis or Naomi Levine permission to drive my van license #
               824KYE. Please let me know if there is anything else we can do.
               We so appreciate your help. Desiree Past" Heintz left and I
               called Davis. He agreed to let me come talk with him at 325 NW
               Thomas St Apt B, Pullman, WA 99163 at 1800 hours. At 1756 hours
               I arrived at the specified address with my camera activated. I
               knocked on the door and Davis came outside. We spoke outside
               and he sat himself on the concrete stoop. He was informed we
               were being recorded. I denied any deflating of tires but did
               recall call Ramirez "Juanita" which was allegedly related to
               the deflating incident. Davis confirmed he had worked at
               Paradise Creek Bicycles in Moscow, ID. He stated he had used
               another friends car a couple of times to get their for the job
               interviews and Heintz's vehicle a couple of times as well. He
               initially stated he had permission to use Heintz's vehicle. He
               confirmed what Heintz said in that he returned the keys to her
               in the kitchen and Levine was present. Davis said he had

               permission to use the vehicle in the morning for work but then
               came home, placed the keys on the entertainment center, got a
               resume together for a job at the Math Department, and went back
               out with the vehicle. When he returned and gave the keys back
               saying something to the effect of "oh by the way I took your
               car again", questioning whether he actually had permission to
               use it at that point in time. Davis said he had no contact with
               Past during July or August 2014. I left and called Levine. I
               left a message and later spoke with her on the phone at
               approximately 1835 hours. I asked to meet with her but she
               declined as she said the conversation would trigger her anxiety
               disorder and she would vomit. I told her I was not afraid of
               vomit but it was up to her. She preferred to speak on the
               phone. She recalled the day in which Davis brought the keys
               into the kitchen. She said Heintz was angry with Davis and that
               it was "understandable" for her to be angry but she became
               "hostile" with him and used "curse" words. She stated that
               Davis apologized for using the vehicle and he paid her back. I
               asked how her paid her back. Levine stated Davis paid to have
               more gas put in the vehicle than he had used. I clarified what
               Davis was apologizing for and Leving confirmed it was for
               taking Heintz's vehicle without permission. This part of the
               conversation was on speaker phone so I could take notes and
               Ofc. Kirshner was present to hear this. I asked Levine how she
               was doing with the situation and she said she had been having
               panic attacks and night sweats. She felt threatened by Heintz
               as she said that on 051515 Heintz told Levine she should work
               more hours at work so she would not be around. I confirmed with
               Levine that she had spoken with Ofc. Jones and she had directed
               her to resources she may need to deal with this situation. I
               reinforced she said any communication to Housing in emails to
               document her correspondence. Our conversation ended. I then
               called Heintz to ask about possible threats she made on 051515
               towards Levine. As of 2016 hours on 051715 I have not heard
               back from her. Case pending. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 17th day of
