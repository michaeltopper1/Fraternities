        Incident Address : 1125 SE Washington St; Health & Wellness
                           PULLMAN              WA 99163

        Time Reported: 11:29
    Time Occurred between: 11:27:28 06/22/15 - 11:27:28 06/22/15

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Olmstead/339 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2812 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched to WSU
               Health and Wellness for a report of a suicidal female. The
               female was taken into protective custody and transported to the
               hospital. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 06-22-2015 at about 1129 hrs I was dispatched to WSU Health
               and Wellness, 1125 SE Washington Street, for a report of a
               suicidal female. Officer Tiengo and I arrived on scene and
               contacted Kelly W. Williams (DOB 05-23-1980). Williams is a
               registered nurse employed by WSU Health and Wellness. Williams
               told me she was treating a patient, who was later identified as
               Yan Liu (DOB 10-15-1988). Williams stated that Liu had suffered
               a "psychotic break" and was suicidal. Williams said she had
               observed what appeared to be self inflicted lacerations on
               Liu's body and described Liu as being disoriented. Williams
               explained that Liu could not answer basic questions and
               characterized Liu's mannerisms as "infantile". Williams told me
               that Liu is an intelligent WSU engineering student who is
               usually very articulate. Williams told me it was her
               professional opinion that Liu was suicidal, was suffering from
               a mental disorder, and was a danger to herself. Williams stated
               that Liu should be taken into protective custody and
               transported to the hospital. I contacted Liu in an examination
               room. I told Liu that she was in protective custody and
               explained to her that I would be transporting her to the
               Pullman Regional Hospital. While speaking with Liu, I noticed
               that she was very quite and subdued. Liu appeared to be on the
               verge of crying and could not remember her date of birth. I
               transported Liu to the Pullman Regional Hospital without
               incident. Liu was admitted to the hospital, and I cleared the
               scene. The protective custody form was downloaded into Spillman
               and attached to this case. I request this case be forwarded to
               WSU Counseling Services. No further action at this time.
               Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this __22__ day of __June___, 2015,
               in Pullman, Washington. _______________________________________

               at University Stores. Once on scene Ofc. Kirshner and I
               searched the interior of the building as Ofc. Petlovany watched
               the rear exit doors. After the search nobody was found to be
               inside. I located an exit door on the southern wall that was
               ajar. I believe that the door was closed but the latch had not
               engaged. When the door opened slightly it set off the door
               sensor alarm. I found no evidence that someone attempted to
               break into the business. All the doors were secured and the
