    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: JAK/333 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2722 SYNOPSIS: A white male was
               contacted by a motorist on Terre View near the Chief Joseph
               Apartments as it appeared as if he were having a seizure. The
               male was deemed to have been vomiting due to alcohol
               consumption. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 06-14-15, Honey D. Gibler (10-08-78) was driving
               East on Terre View when she observed a white male near the
               entrance to the Chief Joseph Apartments. She stopped her car to
               check on the male as she said it appeared as if he was having a
               seizure. Officer Welter and I responded and identified the male
               as Dustin E. Leitzell (06-21-91). Gibler said when she first
               saw Leitzell it looked like he was "Flopping around like a fish
               on the ground". Leitzell said he had too much alcohol last
               night and was actually bent over vomiting. I could smell the
               odor of intoxicants on his breath as he spoke. Officer Welter
               gathered identifying information for Gibler and told her she
               was free to leave. He then gathered identifying information for
               Leitzell. Leitzell is 23 years of age and was not breaking any
               laws and appeared to be able to care for himself. The City of
               Pullman's Fire Department Medics arrived on scene and also did
               not see any reason Leitzell could not take care of himself.
               Officer Welter and I cleared without having to take any action.
               The call of an Alcohol Overdose is unfounded. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               14th day of June, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               Harms 04/09/95 Student Conduct Poss. of Marijuana NARRATIVE: On
               06/14/15 at approximately 2241 hours Cpl. Kuhrt and I were on
               foot patrol in the area of Stephenson Complex. A few minutes
               earlier we had seen two males walking through the parking lot
               towards a car. One of the males had a backpack on which seemed
               odd for the hour. We said hello as they passed and continued on
               our foot patrol. Cpl. Kuhrt took notice of the car they walked
               to as we were walking away from their location. After walking
               around the complex for several minutes we returned to the area
               where we last saw the two. We came across a parked silver 2003
               Honda Civic with two people in it. Cpl. Kuhrt when to the
               passenger side as I went to the driver's side. We turned on our
               flashlights and the driver, later identified as Gurinder Singh
               Narwal 03/25/95, rolled down the window. When Narwal rolled
               down the window I could see a sandwich bag of marijuana in his
               lap along side a metal grinder. I told Narwal I was recording
               and asked if he had a medical marijuana card. Narwal said he
               did and I asked for it. Narwal handed me a paper that explained
               the medical marijuana law. I again asked for his authorization
               and Narwal began to frantically look for it. While I spoke with
               Narwal, Cpl. Kuhrt spoke with the passenger Joshua Justin Harms
               04/09/95. Narwal found his authorization and handed it to me.
               The authorization appeared to be legitimate. I asked to see
               Narwal's marijuana and Narwal handed me the sandwich bag that
               contained approximately four grams of fresh marijuana. I asked
               to see his pipe as well. Narwal handed me a small glass pipe
               that was still warm to the touch from use. Cpl. Kuhrt asked
               Harms where the marijuana came from that he smoked. Harms said
               Narwal provided it. Harms admitted to talking to hits off the
               pipe. I spoke with Narwal who clearly did not have an
               understanding of the medical marijuana laws. I explained to
               Narwal that by him giving Harms his "medicine" he had committed
               a felony by delivering a controlled substance. I also explained
               that he could be charged with possession of marijuana less than
               40 grams and cited with consuming marijuana in public. Both
               Narwal and Harms were attending the ALIVE session that was
               being held at the Stephenson Complex. I told the two that I
               decided not to arrest them but they would be referred to

               that if he was contacted again for the same thing he would be
               arrested. Both were told they were free to go and we walked
               off. Cpl. Kuhrt and I spoke with one of the ALIVE coordinators
               about our contact with Narwal and Harms. This case will be
               referred to student conduct. END OF REPORT I certify and

               hours I was traveling southbound on Stadium way when I observed
               a vehicle traveling northbound with the headlights off. I
               turned, activated my emergency lights and conducted a traffic
               stop on Stadium Way near Ferdinand's Ln. As I approached the
               driver's window I could see an open box of beer cans between
               the front seats and the back seat. I informed the driver the
               stop was being recorded and I asked for his driver's license,
               vehicle registration and proof of insurance. The driver, Blake
               J. Imler (080194), provided the information I requested. I
               asked him how old he was and he stated 20 years old and the
               date of birth on his license confirmed that. I asked Imler
               about the beer behind his seat. He said it was his brother's
               vehicle. I went back to my vehicle to run his information
               through dispatch. Officer Petlovany arrived on scene and I
               handed him Imler's information to run. I went back up to Imler
               and asked if he would call his brother so I could talk to him,
               he said he would and dialed his brother, Kyle, and handed me
               the phone. His brother answered, I introduced myself and asked
               when he had last driven the vehicle. He said he had not driven
               it for a couple of months. I asked if there was anything in the
               vehicle that was his and he said there was not. I asked Imler
               if he would hand me the beer, he handed me the beer. I asked if
               there was any other alcohol in the vehicle and he handed me a
               vodka bottle from the pouch in the back of the passenger seat.
               I placed the alcohol in the back of my patrol vehicle. I asked
               Imler to step out of the vehicle, and he did. I placed Imler
               under arrest for minor in possession of alcohol. I placed him
               in handcuffs(DL), informed him again he was being recorded and
               I read him Miranda warnings from my department issued card. I
               searched Imler incident to arrest and found nothing. I then had
               him take a seat in the back seat of my patrol vehicle. Imler's
               parents arrived on scene while I was completing the citation. I
               spoke with them briefly and explained I was going to cite and
               release Imler. There was also a young male with his parents. I
               issued and explained the Sector citation (#5Z0223820) for MIP
               to Imler and released him. I asked Imler if the male with his
               parents was his brother that I spoke with. He said it was. I

               asked Imler how old his brother was and he said 18. I returned
               to the office. I photographed and poured out the alcohol. There
               was 13 unopened 12 ounce beer cans and a half full vodka
               bottle. Corporal Kuhrt assisted and observed the destruction of

               06/14/15 at approximately 2315 hours I was traveling north on
               NE Stadium Way near Goldsworthy Hall. The defendant's vehicle
               was traveling south towards my vehicle. I activated my radar
               (Veh 17) and it displayed a speed reading of 37MPH in a 20MPH
               speed zone. I turned around and caught up with the vehicle at
               the intersection of Stadium Way and Main St. I activated my
               emergency lights and the vehicle stopped on E Main near Sellas.
               I activated my VieVu camera. I contacted the driver and advised
               him that I was recording and the reason for the stop. I asked
               for his license, registration, and proof of insurance, which he
               provided. The driver was identified by Idaho DL as Marwan

               Bandar his license was suspended and advised him he was under
               arrest for DWLS. I advised him of his right to counsel and
               reminded him I was audio and video recording. I explained the
               citation to Bandar and provided him a copy. I released Bandar
               from custody and allowed him to pull his vehicle off the
               roadway. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
