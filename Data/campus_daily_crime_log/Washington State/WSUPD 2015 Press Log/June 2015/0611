               over to the police department. Officer was able to locate the
               owner and return it to him. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 06-11-15 at approximately 1152
               hours I was dispatched to the report of a found laptop at the
               Compton Union Building (CUB), located at 1500 NE Terrell Mall.
               I arrived on scene. I contacted the complainant, Hannah E.
               Buchan (DOB 10-18-92), at the Information Desk in the CUB.
               Buchan is an employee at the CUB. Buchan handed me a silver,
               Apple Mac Book Air. She told me she found it on an empty table
               at about 1130 hours. I cleared the scene. I returned to the
               station, and opened the Mac Book Air. It was signed on to by a
               Patrick Doran. At about 1210 hours I called Doran on the phone,
               but there was no answer so I left a voicemail. At about 1340
               hours a male approached me outside the police department. He
               later identified himself as Patrick B. Doran (DOB 10-25-93).
               Doran told me he received my voicemail and was here to pick up
               his laptop. I had Doran describe the laptop for me, and he was
               able to. I retrieved the laptop from the front office of the
               police department and returned it to Doran. I advised Doran not
               to leave his property unattended even if it is only for a
               couple minutes. No further action. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 11th day of

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2698 SYNOPSIS: Ballard cited and
               released for DWLS 3rd. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               Marissa M. Ballard/09-20-93 Cite & Release DWLS 3rd 5Z0674674 &
               5Z0674673 2. NARRATIVE: On 06-11-15 at about 1902 hours I was
               on patrol in vehicle 38, traveling westbound on Valley Rd near
               Brandi Way when I observed a car traveling eastbound, which
               appeared to be traveling faster than the posted speed limit of
               25MPH. I activated my MPH moving radar and heard a high
               pitched, steady tone. I observed a speed reading of 45 MPH.
               This speed reading was consistent with my visual estimate of
               the vehicle speed. This vehicle was the only vehicle in the
               radar field at the time of the reading. I turned around behind
               the vehicle, a green 2001 Mitsubishi Mirage (WA/527YNZ), and
               activated my emergency lights. The car turned left into the
               parking lot of Kamiak Apartments and stopped. I contacted the
               driver, told her the stop was being audio and video recorded
               and the reason for the stop. She did not seem surprised when I
               told her what her speed was and asked if she was in a hurry to
               get somewhere, she said no. I asked the driver for her driver's
               license, registration and proof of insurance, which she
               provided. Her WADL identified her as Marissa Mary Ballard. I
               returned to my vehicle and checked Ballard's driving status.
               Whitcom advised that Ballard was DWLS 3rd for unpaid tickets. I
               returned to Ballard's vehicle and asked her if she knew her
               license was suspended. She said she did not know that and told
               me a story about getting a ticket, but she paid it. She said
               she did receive a letter from DOL stating her license would be
               suspended if she did not pay her ticket, but since she thought
               she did, she did not look into the issue. I told Ballard that
               she needed to turn off her car and get out, which she
               eventually did. Once out of the vehicle I told her she was
               under arrest for driving with a suspended license, that she had
               a right to an attorney and again that she was being audio and
               video recorded. I placed her in handcuffs, double locked. I did
               not search Ballard since she was only wearing a bathing suit
               bottom with a cover up type shirt. I placed her in the back
               seat of my patrol car where I read her complete Miranda
               warnings to her. Ballard stated she understood her rights and
               agreed to talk to me. I completed a criminal sector citation
               for DWLS 3rd degree and a traffic infraction for her speed,
               45MPH/25MPH zone. I explained each ticket to Ballard and gave
               her a copy. I released Ballard from custody and told her not to
               drive. I asked if she needed a phone to call a friend and she
