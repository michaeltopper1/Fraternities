    Narrative: RVWD: dd/329 OFC: DBT/321 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2838 SYNOPSIS: RP reporting an attempted
               scam over the phone. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 06-24-15 at approximately 0935 hours I was
               dispatched to the report of a telephone fraud. Dispatch advised
               the complainant, Elizabeth Thomas (DOB 11-19-78), was
               requesting phone contact. I called Thomas on the telephone.
               Thomas said on 06-24-15 at about 0928 hours she received a
               phone call from phone number 415-555-0128. Thomas said she
               thinks the man on the phone said his name was "Mead", but she
               was not sure. Thomas said he was difficult to understand
               because of his accent. Thomas said the caller said he worked
               for Microsoft, and that Thomas had corrupt files on her
               computer. The man told Thomas she needs to login to an account
               and he can fix her computer. Thomas told me she realized it was
               a scam and she told the caller she would be calling the police.
               Thomas said the man on the other end then hung up the
               telephone. Thomas told me this is the first time she has
               received a phone call from that number. I recommended to Thomas
               that she block the number. I also explained to her how to file
               a complaint on the Internet Crime Complaint Center. At about
               0949 hours I tried calling 415-555-0128, but it would not go
               through. I searched the phone number online and their were
               numerous complaints about it being a scam. No further action at
               this time. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 24th day of June, 2015, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer
