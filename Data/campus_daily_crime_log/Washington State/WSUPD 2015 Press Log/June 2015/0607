               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2649 SYNOPSIS: Whitman County SO
               requested an agency assist for WSU PD units to respond to a
               burglary alarm at James Toyota on SR 270. When we arrived
               employees exited the building and said the alarm was set off in
               error. Nothing further. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               2. NARRATIVE: On 06/08/15 at about 0540 hours Whitman County
               Sheriff's office was dispatched to a burglary alarm at James
               Toyota on state route 270. Dispatch contacted Sgt. Cooper at
               home. He said if WSU PD units were available to respond they
               could. Officer Tiengo and I responded. I arrived and set up on
               the southeast corner of the building. Officer Tiengo set up on
               the northwest corner. I saw two employees in the garage area.
               They exited the building and were wearing James Toyota shirts.
               Jesse L. Abbott (012882) provided his identification and stated
               the alarm was set off by accident. They thought they reset the
               alarm at one point but additional alarms went off when they
               accessed other parts of the building. Abbott said they were
               locked out of the alarm system, but his manger would be in at
               seven and would be able to reset it. Officer Tiengo and I
               walked through the building and nothing seemed out of the
               ordinary. Employee error. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
