               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 23 February 2015 at
               about 2026 hours, I was dispatched to a harassment call at Nez
               Perce Apartments, apartment L49. I spoke with Mackenzie Ellis.
               She stated her boyfriend Drew Philips had received several
               facebook instant messages about her. The message were about her
               having sex with her ex-boyfriend Joseph Townsend. Also they
               stated since she had joined a sorority she was sleeping with
               other guys as well. It mentioned she had a apartment warming
               party at her new apartment. Mackenzie stated she had just moved
               into the apartment on Sunday and the decision to move was made
               on Saturday. She stated only a few close friends and family
               knew where she had moved to. Mackenzie believes the messages
               may have come from her former roommate Anna Bersani or Daylen
               Lokey (Bernsani's boyfriend). Mackenzie said she had Bersani
               were having serious problems and they were why she moved out of
               her previous apartment. The messages came from the user name
               Maddie Larson and stated she was Townsend's girlfriend.
               Townsend told Mackenzie Larson was not his girlfriend and the
               picture attached to the profile was no one he knew. Mackenzie
               stated she didn't want anything done she just wanted it on
               record about what is going on. I provided Mackenzie with ideas
               on how to guard her personal safety. I also provided her
               information on contacting OEO and student conduct. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.

               was dispatched to a reported hit and run collision. Upon my
               arrival I contacted the reporting party, later identified as
               Cindy C Alred (02/27/55), who told me the following. Alred
               explained she had arrived at work on 06/22/15 around 0730 hrs.
               She backed her vehicle into a parking spot closest to Grimes
               Way and went into work for the day. Around 1930 hrs, after
               leaving for the day, she noticed the front passenger side front
               fender had a dent in it. I asked where she was when she noticed
               the damage and was told she had been at McDonalds standing
               outside of her vehicle while speaking with her daughter. When
               asked about other vehicles parked near her during the day, she
               could only tell me when she arrived there were no other
               vehicles near her. She added she did not return to her vehicle
               again until she left and met her daughter around 1930 hrs. At
               this point I photographed the damage to her vehicle, which
               included a half dollar size dent on the front passenger side
               quarter panel. In addition to the dent I noticed some slight
               scraping on the front passenger side corner of the bumper cover
               and light trim piece. I estimated the damage to be around
               $600.00 and provided Alred with my business card and case
               number for reference. Prior to clearing I asked Alred to
               contact me if she found out anything that might be related to
               this case or if she had any further questions. She told me she
               would and I cleared a short time later. Nothing further. I

               Johnson/02-03-47 VEHICLE 1: Gold 2005 Ford Freestyle WA/L253WSU
               INSURANCE: Not provided DAMAGE: paint transfer and scrapes on

               Red 2014 Toyota Tundra WA/X869WSU INSURANCE: DAMAGE: plastic

               Camille Sessoms/05-31-97 - 253-737-8285 NARRATIVE: On 06-23-15
               at about 1628 hours I was dispatched to the report of a hit and
               run collision in the WSU President's Residence parking lot. The
               RP, Camille Sessoms, called stating that she was in the parking
               lot when she witnessed a gold Ford Freestyle sedan hit a
               parked, unoccupied truck. She said she watched as the female
               driver, approximately 50-60 years old, exited the Ford sedan
               and walk away. Sessoms identified the vehicles invovled as
               being a gold Ford Freestyle, WA/L253WSU and a red Toyota Tundra
               WA/X869WSU. I responded to the parking lot and contacted
               Sessoms. She showed me to the parked vehicles and I saw fresh
               damage on the red Toyota truck as well as on the gold Ford
               sedan. I took pictures of the damage, which were later
               downloaded to this case. The Ford sedan had minor paint
               transfer and scrapes on the driver's side front bumper. The
               truck had paint transfer and scrapes spanning almost the entire
               length of the passenger cabin, along the rear and front
               passenger doors. There was also damage to the passenger side
               running board. While attempting to identify vehicle owners, I
               saw a male approach the truck and inspect the damage. I
               contacted him and asked if the truck belonged to him. He said
               it did, and identified himself as Wesley H. Howell. I confirmed
               his contact information, and asked if I could provide it to the
               owner of the other car so they could work on getting the
               vehicles fixed. He said that would be fine. He asked who the
               other car belonged to and I told him that it returned to Glenn
               Johnson and his wife, Kathryn. He told me that he is friends
               with Glenn. I gave Howell my business card with the case
               number. Howell left the area. I then wrote Howell's contact
               information on another business card for Kathryn Johnson. I
               knew Cpl. Daniels was at the President's Residence for a
               memorial service and that Johnson was most likely there. I
               asked her to find Johnson and have her meet me outside at her
               vehicle. Daniels got on the radio and told me that she found
               Johnson but that Johnson told her that she did not hit the

               truck. I advised that she did. A short time later Daniels came
               outside to meet with me. I showed her the damage on Johnson's
               car and the pictures of the damage to the truck. I asked
               Daniels to provide my business card to Johnson which had the
               case number and Howell's information on it. She said she would.
               I also asked her to tell Johnson to email me her contact and
               insurance information. Daniels said she would do that. As of
               2140 hours I have not received an email from Johnson. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.
               Dated this 23rd day of June, 2015 in Pullman, Washington.
