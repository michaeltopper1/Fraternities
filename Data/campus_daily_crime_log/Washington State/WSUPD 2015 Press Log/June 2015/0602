               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2599 SYNOPSIS: Residence Inn advised
               four subjects had been smoking marijuana in their hotel room.
               Officers responded and escorted subjects out, after they
               gathered their belongings. All subjects are WSU Students and
               will be referred to WSU Student Conduct. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 06-02-15 at
               approximately 1325 hours I was dispatched to the report of
               residents smoking marijuana in room #323 at the Residence Inn,
               located at 1255 NE North Fairway Rd. Dispatch advised the
               complaint said there was large amounts of drug paraphernalia
               inside their room. The complainant advised the subjects have
               been locked out of their room and are in the front lobby for
               contact. Ofc. Welter and I arrived on scene. As soon as Ofc.
               Welter and I entered the lobby one of the male subjects
               approached us, and he said he was having medical issues. The
               male was later identified as John R. Smith (DOB 08-04-93).
               Smith demanded he get his medicine from his backpack that was
               locked inside of room #323. Ofc. Welter asked Smith if he
               needed medical attention, and Smith said yes. Smith said he was
               having a panic attack. Ofc. Welter asked Dispatch for medics to
               respond to check out Smith. Ofc. Welter and I then spoke with
               the general manager, Sara L. Raquet (DOB 10-26-73), of the
               Residence Inn. Raquet told us they went inside to clean room
               #323 because the residence had not checked out. Raquet said
               when they walked into the room there was the strong odor of
               marijuana inside. She then told us there were bongs in there as
               well. Raquet said the residence of the room when in the pool at
               the time, so she locked them out of the room. She said the
               residents were in the lobby upset they could not get into their
               room. Raquet told us that is when she called the police. I
               asked Raquet what she would like us to do with the residence.
               She said she would like them to get their things and leave the
               Residence Inn. She also said they would have to pay a $250.00
               fee in order to clean the room. Raquet told us the room #323 is
               registered to Clarice A. Schaefbauer (DOB 09-14-93). I went to
               a conference room so I could speak with Schaefbauer and the
               other two residents of room #323, who were later identified as
               Deven A. Forest (DOB 09-27-93) and Dante A. Kessler (DOB 06-06-
               93). Ofc. Welter went to speak with Smith outside because he
               said his panic attack was getting more severe. I told
               Schaefbauer, Forest, and Kessler I was audio and video
               recording. Forest told me the reason their room smells is
               because they do have marijuana paraphernalia in there. He said

               there is a bong in there because they did not want to leave it
               in the car. I read all of them their Constitutional Rights from
               my department issued Miranda Warning Card. They all told me
               they understood their rights, and they would be willing to
               speak with me. Forest told me he had been smoking a joint
               containing marijuana outside. He then said "we even have a pile
               of open marijuana on our desk". They told me they rolled up a
               joint on the desk to take outside. Schaefbauer, Forest, and
               Kessler are all over the age of 21. I asked them how much
               marijuana they had in the room, and they said just a little
               jar. I asked them how much drug paraphernalia was in the room.
               They told me there were two bongs on the desk. They said one of
               the bongs was broken though. I told them there would be no
               criminal charges, but they needed to gather up all their
               belongings and leave. They told me they would get there things
               and get out. Pullman medics arrived on scene and were checking
               on Smith. Cpl. Daniels and Ofc. Welter were waiting with Forest
               and the medics. Pullman medics determined Forest would be okay,
               and cleared the scene. I told Raquet they were going to gather
               their belongings and leave the hotel. She told me she needed
               the $250.00 before she was going to unlock their room. I let
               Kessler use a cell phone so he could call his parents to ask
               for the money. Smith began to get upset because he was just
               visiting his friends in the room and wanted to retrieve his
               backpack and leave. Kessler got permission from his parents to
               put the $250.00 on his credit card. I followed Kessler and
               Smith up to room #325 No further action. My Vievu camera was
               activated, and the video has been downloaded into the permenant
               digital evidence folder. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 3rd day of June,

               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 06-02-15 at
               about 1659 hours I heard Whitcom dispatching Pullman Fire units
               to the Regents Hall circle for the report of a possible vehicle
               fire. As I was enroute I also heard them advise PFD that this
               was a 4th party report of smoke "billowing" out of a red
               Porsche. I arrived on scene and did not see any smoke in the
               area. I located the red Porsche. I could smell what I
               recognized as burning oil, but there was no active fire. I
               touched the hood of the car and it was warm. I asked Whitcom to
               attempt to locate an owner for the car but there was no contact
               information for the registered owner. I told Whitcom to let PFD
               know they could disregard, since there was no fire emergency.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 3rd day of June, 2015, in

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2604 SYNOPSIS: I responded to a 2
               vehicle, non-injury collision on Stadium Way near McCoy Hall.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 06-02-
               15, at approximately 1740 hours, I responded to Stadium Way
               near McCoy Hall for a 2 vehicle, non-injury collision. Corporal
               Edwards also responded to the collision. Upon our arrival, I
               asked both drivers if they were ok or needed medical attention.
               Both drivers said they were uninjured. Corporal Edwards began
               talking to the drivers who were involved in the collision and
               asked them for their vehicle registrations, Driver's Licenses,
               and Proof of Liability Insurance. I asked Whitcom to have the
               Pullman Fire Department to respond to place some absorbent on
               the radiator fluid that was leaking from one of the vehicles
               and for a tow truck to respond to our location. I then began
               taking photographs of the vehicles while Corporal created an
               exchange of information document for the drivers. After I
               finished taking photographs I spoke with a male, who I
               identified as Adam C. Strong (06-09-77). I asked Strong to tell
               me his side of what happened. Strong said he was driving his
               Toyota Rav 4 (WA/AKX2720) North on Stadium Way when he made
               somewhat of an abrupt stop near McCoy Hall. He said a female
               had stepped into the cross walk that crossed Stadium Way near
               McCoy Hall. He said he stopped his car for the female in the
               cross walk. He said it was then his car was struck from behind.
               I told Strong I would be with him in a few moments. I then
               spoke with a female, I identified as Jacqlyn Michelle Sams (12-
               16-94). I asked Sams to give me her side of what happened. Sams
               said she was driving her maroon Acura MDX (WA/849ZKL) North on
               Stadium Way behind a silver Rav 4. She said she saw a female in
               the cross walk near McCoy Hall and wasn't sure why she didn't
               put 2 and 2 together that the Rav 4 had stopped for the female
               in the cross walk. She said she then ran into the Rav 4 Strong
               was driving. I told her I would be with her in a few moments. I
               gave Strong his copy of the exchange of information document,
               explained it to him and told him he was free to go. I issued
               Sams a Traffic Infraction (I-10999) for RCW 46.61.145 Following
               Too Close and RCW 46.30.020 (1a) as her insurance card had
               expired and explained it to her. I gave her a copy of the
               exchange of information document and told her she was free to
               go. The Toyota Rav 4 (WA/AKX2720) had approximately $1500.00 in
               damage to the entire rear end of the vehicle. The Acura MDX
               (WA/849ZKL)had approximately $3000.00 in damage to the entire
               front end of the vehicle. There was also radiator fluid
