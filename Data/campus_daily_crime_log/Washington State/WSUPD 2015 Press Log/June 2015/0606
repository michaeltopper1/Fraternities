    Narrative: RVWD: dd/329 OFC: Olmstead/339 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY
               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2633 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched
               to an agency assist for the Whitman County Sheriff's Office in
               Albion, Washington. The complainant reported suspicious
               activity in her neighborhood. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 06-06-2015 at about 1235 hrs I
               was dispatched to an agency assist for the Whitman County
               Sheriff's Office in Albion, Washington. Dispatch advised that
               the complainant, Cayla J. Besherse (DOB 06-04-1989), had
               reported two suspicious individuals near her residence at 104
               North D Street. Officer Welter, Trooper Aucutt, and I arrived
               on scene. I contacted a witness, identified as Shawna M. Hance
               (DOB 09-28-1975). Hance resides at 106 North D Street. Officer
               Welter and Trooper Aucutt began looking around town for the
               suspicious individuals. Hance stated she had observed an adult
               male with a heavy build walk up to the front door of Besherse's
               house. Hance believed the male might have reached for the door
               knob on the front door and then briefly walked around the front
               yard. Hance said an adult female wearing a flower print dress
               was waiting for the male in a silver pickup with a black
               canopy. Hance said she spoke with the female and inquired about
               what they were doing. The female stated they were looking for
               bottles. Hance did not recognize the individuals and thought
               their actions were suspicious. As I was speaking with Hance,
               Officer Welter and Trooper Aucutt advised they had located the
               suspicious male and female in the backyard of a residence at
               208 North Main Street. I responded to that location and
               contacted Officer Welter and Trooper Aucutt. Officer Welter
               advised the male and female had been identified as Christopher
               T. Harper (DOB 01-24-1967) and Gerri R. Bertsch (DOB 06-30-
               1969). Their vehicle was parked nearby and was identified as a
               silver, 1999 GMC pickup (WA Lic. C20297A). Officer Welter
               advised Harper and Bertsch had historic maps of Albion and were
               identifying the locations of old outhouses. They would then dig
               a hole in the ground and search for antique bottles. I saw
               Harper had dug a hole in the ground and had retrieved several
               bottles. Officer Welter contacted the resident of 208 North
               Main Street, Carol D. Ranta (DOB 02-06-1959), and determined
               she had given Harper permission to dig on her property. I
               counseled Harper about his actions at Besherse's residence, and
               he denied trying the door knob or walking around the yard.
               Harper said he only walked to the front door, knocked on the
               door, and then left. I warned Harper and Bertsch they must stay
               off private property unless they receive permission from the

               hours I was dispatched to a welfare check on North Fairway Dr.
               near Beasley Coliseum. A male subject was reported walking into
               traffic and he appeared disoriented. I arrived and contacted
               the subject, Jonathan S. Billing (112573). He was sitting on
               the sidewalk on the south side of North Fairway Rd near Beasley
               Coliseum. Billing stood up when I contacted him. He had
               difficulty getting to his feet. He was also slurring his words
               and seemed irritated that I was there attempting to assist him.
               I could also smell a strong odor of intoxicants coming from
               Billing. I asked Billing if he was with anyone and he said he
               was not. I asked him where he was going he said he was going up
               the street. He then stated he was having trouble seeing. I
               asked why he was having trouble seeing and asked if he had been
               drinking today, he did not answer and began to walk away. I
               asked him if there was anything I could do to help. He said he
               was going a couple blocks up to meet his ride. I asked him if I
               could call his ride for him to see where they were. Billing sat
               down again on the sidewalk. I asked Billing his name and date
               of birth and he gave me both. I asked if he was able to give me
               the name of a friend who would pick him up. He gave me his
               phone and asked me to messenger a friend of his. The battery on
               his phone was dead so I was unable to get ahold of anyone that
               way. He then gave me the name of a friend, Antonia R. K. Hughes
               041990, who would give him a ride. He could not remember her
               number. I asked dispatch if they could get a phone number for
               her and they did. I called Hughes and she said she would come
               and pick up Billing. I waited with Billing until Hughes showed
               up. Hughes helped Billing to her vehicle. Nothing further. I
