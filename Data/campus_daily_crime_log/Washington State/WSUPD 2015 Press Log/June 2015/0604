               released for DWLS 3rd Degree. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE

               DWLS 3rd C-8765 2. NARRATIVE: On 06-04-15 at approximately 0712
               hours, I was parked on the side of the roadway monitoring
               traffic on Grimes Way near the Cattle Feed Lab when I observed
               a which appeared to be traveling in excess of the posted 20
               mph. I activated my Speed Measuring Device in the stationary
               mode and observed a reading of 28 mph. The vehicle was
               traveling east bound and was over 500 feet in front of the next
               moving vehicle. I observed the SMD emitted a steady high
               pitched audio tone and the readings of the speed were
               consistent with my observations. As the vehicle passed, I
               activated the rear SMD on my vehicle and observed the vehicle
               continued to travel at the 28 mph speed. At this time, I
               observed a truck begin to pull into the gravel parking lot
               where I was parked. The truck pulled up next to me and the
               driver advised me the vehicle I had just observed traveling at
               28 mph, a red Toyota 4 Runner, had just passed him on Grimes
               Way back near the Markley Building. I thanked the driver for
               the information and I pulled out and caught up to the vehicle
               on SE Terre View Dr near the 4900 block and activated my
               emergency lights. The vehicle turned left into the gravel road
               of 4900 SE Terre View Dr, and I activated my Vievu camera. I
               checked the calibration of the SMD before and after the traffic
               stop and found it in proper working order. I contacted the
               driver who had begun to dig in the glove box as I approached. I
               advised the driver the traffic stop was being recorded and
               advised him why I had stopped him. I asked him for his license,
               registration, and proof of insurance. The male advised me the
               vehicle did not belong to him and he was borrowing it from a
               friend. He looked through papers he had pulled out of the glove
               box and I asked him for his driver's license. He began patting
               down his pockets and as he did this, I observed he had a black
               leather wallet in his left coat pocket. He continued for about
               thirty seconds and then told me he must have left his license
               at home. I asked him if it was in his wallet in his pocket, and
               he said, "oh", dropped his head and said yeah. He started to
               hand me the whole wallet and I asked him to remove the license
               from it. He handed me his card, and I observed it was an Idaho
               Identification Card. He was identified as Joshua Corey
               Devleming/07-02-93. Joshua seemed to be very nervous as I
               contacted him. I asked him to remain in the vehicle as I

               returned to my car. I did a driver's check and he returned as
               DWLS 3rd degree. I was also advised he had a non-extraditable
               warrant out of Spokane County. I waited for another officer to
               arrive, and a short time later Sgt. Jacobson arrived on scene.
               I returned to the vehicle and asked Joshua to step out of the
               vehicle. He was on the phone and asked if he could finish the
               call. I advised him he could call the person back in a few
               minutes. I advised Joshua he was under arrest for DWLS 3rd and
               advised him he had the right to an attorney. I also advised him
               I was still video and audio recording. He stated he understood.
               Joshua was handcuffed, the handcuffs were double locked, he was
               searched, and placed in the rear of my patrol vehicle. Joshua
               told me he wanted to be honest and stated he knew his license
               was suspended. I advised him of the non-extraditable warrant
               out of Spokane County and advised him he needed to take care of
               it. He stated he understood. A short time later I explained and
               issued Joshua Criminal Citation #C-8765 for RCW 46.20.342.1C
               for DWLS 3rd Degree. I advised him to not drive and he stated
               he wouldn't. I issued him a verbal warning for the speed and
               for passing on Grimes Way, and he apologized for his behavior.
               I cleared. My VieVu video was later downloaded to the S: drive.
               I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws
               of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 4th day of June, 2015, in Pullman,

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2626 SYNOPSIS: Report of a black cow in
               the middle of Grimes Way. The bull was escorted back to his
               pen. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               06-04-15 at about 2028 hours I was dispatched to the report of
               an animal problem on Grimes Way. Whitcom advised that a caller
               was reporting a black cow in the middle of Grimes Way. I
               responded to the area and saw a male subject, identified as
               Alex A. Koszarek, attempting to keep a black cow in the parking
               area of the cattle feeding lab. Koszarek told me that he was
               driving down Grimes Way and stopped for a black cow in the
               road. He said he was not sure how it got out since all of the
               gates in the immediate area were intact and locked. I requested
               the assistanec of Officer Jones and together we attempted to
               get the cow back into the fenced area. This was not an easy
               task. We eventually found an open gate on the west side of the
               building and got the bull through the gate. We were then told
               my Koszarek that his friend was near the back of the cattle
               feeding lab and it appeared that there was another cow that had
               escaped and was possibly stuck. I had asked Whitcom to call a
               responsible but the contact list was out of date. They were
               then able to speak with Brent McCann who is the Animal Care
               Facility Manager for beef. McCann arrived on scene just as we
               got both escaped bulls back into a locked pen. Koszarek and his
               unidentified friend were very helpful in resolving the
               incident. Officer Jones later sent McCann an email with the
               premise contact paperwork for Whitcom. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               5th day of June, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.
