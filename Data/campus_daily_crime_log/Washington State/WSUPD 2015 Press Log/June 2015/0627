               for a domestic from Whitman County Sheriff's Office. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Tyler, Toussaint L (03/19/59) 2.
               Dillsi, Lameece N (02/02/73) NARRATIVE: On 06/27/15 around 1149
               hrs the Whitman County Sheriff's Office was dispatched to a
               report of a domestic dispute at 2602 Pullman Albion Rd in
               trailer B-3. Due to their distance away from the scene they
               requested Ofc Olmstead and I respond, which we did. Upon my
               arrival I noticed a male, later identified as Toussaint L Tyler
               (03/19/59) standing on the front steps. Tyler was wearing blue
               jeans, no shirt, and flip flop shoes. As I approached he was
               visibly upset and I asked him what was going on. He explained
               he was sick and tired of the situation with his girlfriend,
               later identified as Lameece N Dillsi (02/02/73), and had
               arranged to get a bus ticket to leave to Seattle at 1330 hrs.
               As we continued to speak Dillsi came across the driveway and
               began to yell at Tyler. Dillsi was yelling about some women's
               undergarments she had found which she claimed did not belong to
               her. As Tyler began to respond I confirmed with him Dillsi was
               the other party involved. He told me she was and I instructed
               her to wait by the front of the vehicle she was standing near
               while I spoke with Tyler. A short time after this Olmstead
               arrived as Dillsi was walking back over to her mother's
               trailer. I asked Olmstead to go and speak with her while I
               continued to speak with Tyler. Olmstead went to locate Dillsi
               and Tyler explained the following to me. Around 1900 hrs on
               06/26/15 Dillsi had been released from the Whitman County Jail.
               Shortly after her return things began to go down hill, with the
               two of them arguing over their children. He went on to tell me
               the children had been removed by CPS and Dillsi has a problem
               with Meth and Heroin, which he described as ongoing. Tyler went
               on to say he was tired of being picked on and had responded
               verbally, but had not touched anyone. He continued and admitted
               to having become so frustrated he began to throw Dillsi's
               clothes out into the living room and out into the yard. In
               addition he told me he had punched a hole in a wall which he
               later showed me. Sometime around this point I activated my
               camera and advised Tyler the conversation was being recorded.
               He told me that was fine and continued to explain what led up
               to officers being called. When I asked him if he had been the
               one to had called 911 he told me he had. I asked him what had
               happened during that call and he explained Dillsi had tried to
               take the phone from him. During the struggle for the phone the

               call became disconnected and the screen to his phone was
               cracked. Shortly after this Deputy Nebe and Deputy Jordan
               arrived on scene. I went and spoke with Nebe and Jordan and
               explained what I had learned as well as where Olmstead was at.
               Nebe took over questioning of Tyler and a short time later I
               was asked if I could provide Tyler with a courtesy transport to
               Dissmores to catch a bus to Seattle. I told him that would be
               fine and after loading Tyler's belongings into my vehicle we
               left before I dropped him off at Dissmores to await the bus.
               Upon my return to the WSU Police Department I completed the
               necessary paperwork and downloaded the video before I cleared
               the call. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2874 SYNOPSIS: PPD was dispatched to a
               traffic offense case in the area of Terre View. I located the
               vehicle several minutes later on Stadium Way. The driver was
               having difficulty turning on his headlights. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Michael D. Pannek 04/04/47 Contacted 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 06/27/15 at approximately 2223 hours I heard
               Pullman Police being dispatched to a traffic offense that
               originally occurred on SR 270. The caller stated there was a
               silver sedan that was driving without any headlights. At the
               time of dispatch the caller last saw the car on Grand Ave
               heading northbound. Pullman Officers were unable to locate the
               car and closed the case. At 2239 hours I was monitoring traffic
               on Stadium Way from Johnson Road when a Chrysler 200 passed my
               location. The Chrysler had no headlights on. I initiated a
               traffic stop at North Fairway and the tennis courts. When
               stopping the car I recognized the license plate from Pullman
               PD's case. I contacted the driver, Michael Dennis Pannek
               04/04/47, and asked if he realized he was not using his
               headlights. Pannek said it was a rental car and he thought they
               were automatic. I showed Pannek how the headlights worked in
               his rental and he provided his WADL. I ran Pannek through
               dispatch and they stated he was clear. I gave Pannek directions
               to his hotel and cleared the stop. I had dispatch relay what I
               found to Pullman PD for their case. END OF REPORT I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               approximately 0112 hours I was sitting on the shoulder of Terre
               View Drive next to the Northwood Manor Apartments monitoring
               traffic. I noticed a vehicle cresting the hill of North
               Fairway, northbound, at a high rate of speed. The vehicle
               appeared to be traveling much faster than the posted 20 MPH
               zone. I activated my handheld radar (Decatur Scout 2013) and
               obtained a reading of 43 MPH. I watched as the vehicle continue
               towards the intersection of North Fairway and Terre View. The
               vehicle slowed slightly before running the stop sign and
               turning left onto westbound Terre View. The vehicle slowed to
               what appeared visually as 30 MPH. It was clear that the driver
               had no intention of stopping. I caught up to the car at Terre
               View and Cougar Ridge Apartments. I initiated a traffic stop
               and the driver pulled into the Cougar Ridge parking lot. I
               contacted the driver, Matthew Joseph Mauro 07/18/93, identified
               myself, informed Mauro that the stop was being recorded, and
               asked Mauro why I was stopping him. Mauro said it was because
               he ran the stop sign. I asked what the speed limit was on North
               Fairway and Mauro said it was 25 MPH. I told him the speed
               limit was 20 MPH and he was going 43 MPH. I asked Mauro why he
               was driving the way he was and Mauro said he was just trying to
               get home. Mauro had a female passenger in his front seat. About
               this time Ofc. Petlovany arrived on scene. Mauro provided his
               WADL, vehicle registration, and expired proof of insurance. I
               had Mauro come talk to me outside of his car. Ofc. Petlovany
               asked Mauro if he had just been on Stadium Way and Mauro said
               yes. Ofc. Petlovany asked Mauro if he saw him turn on his
               emergency lights when they passed. Mauro said he did. Based on
               Mauro doubling the speed limit, the complete disregard for the
               stop sign or anybody who could have been in the intersection,
               and the disregard for his passenger's safety I told Mauro that
               he was under arrest for Reckless Driving and handcuffed (D/L)
               him. I advised Mauro that he was being audio and video
               recorded. I read Mauro his Miranda Rights of my department
               issued card. Mauro said he understood his rights and having
               them in mind still wished to speak with me. I placed Mauro in
               the backseat of my patrol car and explained that I planning on
               filling out a citation and releasing him directly from my car.
               I asked Mauro if he had any questions before I started the

               citation. Mauro asked Ofc. Petlovany why he had flashed his
               emergency lights at him. Ofc. Petlovany said he was trying to
               warn Mauro that he needed to slow down on Stadium Way because
               he was going 30 MPH in the 20 MPH zone. Mauro said he thought
               Ofc. Petlovany was going to pull him over so he turned onto
               North Fairway. I asked Mauro, by Ofc. Petlovany flipping on his
               lights had that had anything to do with his driving that I
               witnessed. Mauro said he originally thought Ofc. Petlovany was
               pulling him over so he came to a stop on North Fairway. When he
               did not see Ofc. Petlovany he sped off quickly. I filled out a
               Sector citation for Reckless Driving and an NOI for no proof of
               insurance. I explained both citations to Mauro and provided him
               with his copies. Mauro was released from custody and Ofc.
               Petlovany and I cleared. END OF REPORT I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               28th day of June, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               and released for DUI. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               Sean M Peterson 03/06/97 Cite/Release DUI C9003 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 06/28/15 at approximately 0100 hours I was traveling west on
               NE Terreview Dr. near Palouse Ridge Golf Course. I saw the
               defendant's vehicle traveling east towards me. I activated my
               radar (Veh 7) and the vehicle's speed was displayed as 42 MPH
               and increased to 47 MPH in a 35MPH speed zone. I turned to
               catch up with the vehicle and noticed it was not decelerating.
               It took approximately 1/2 mile to catch up with the vehicle.
               The defendant's vehicle turned left onto Pullman Airport Rd. At
               this location there are two lanes for southbound (oncoming
               traffic), one for a right turn onto Terreview, and one for a
               left turn onto Terreview. When the vehicle turned left, instead
               of turning into the correct lane, it turned into the right turn
               lane for oncoming traffic, which put the vehicle over 1 1/2
               lanes into oncoming traffic. I activated my emergency lights
               and the vehicle came to a stop in the gravel drive at the west
               end of the airport. I activated my VieVu camera and approached
               the vehicle. As I got to the trunk of the vehicle the front
               passenger door opened and I directed the person back into the
               vehicle. As I got to the driver's door the front passenger door
               opened again and I could hear someone vomiting. I could smell a
               strong odor of intoxicants coming from the vehicle. I told the
               driver the stop was being recorded and the reason for the stop.
               I asked the driver for his license, registration, and proof of
               insurance. The driver provided me with his Idaho license,
               identifying him as Sean M. Peterson 03/06/97. As Peterson was
               reaching for his other documents I noticed his movements were
               slow and he had a dazed look on his face. The passenger
               continued to vomit out of the car. Peterson gave me his
               registration and then looked for his insurance. Peterson gave
               me his insurance and then explained that it was expired and he
               was waiting for his new paperwork. I looked at the insurance
               and it was current. I asked Peterson how much he had to drink
               and he said none. As Peterson spoke his words were slow and
               deliberate. I asked Peterson if I could check his eyes and he
               said yes. I administered an HGN on Peterson with him seated in
               the car. I could see a lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes. I
               asked Peterson how old he was and he said 18. I noticed
               Peterson's eyes were blood shot and watery. I told Peterson to
               remain in his vehicle. I returned to my patrol car and ran
               Peterson's information through Whitcom and he returned clear

               and current. Ofc. Whitman arrived on scene. I turned off my
               front facing emergency lights and returned to Peterson's
               vehicle and asked if he would perform field sobriety tests and
               he said "Could we not please?" I told Peterson ok. I asked
               Peterson to exit his vehicle, which he did. I told Peterson he
               was under arrest for DUI. I handcuffed (D/L) Peterson and
               advised him of his right to counsel. Peterson then said he
               wanted to do the field sobriety tests. I told him that he
               already told me he didn't want to. Peterson said he did.
               Peterson asked if he passed the tests would he be let go. I
               told Peterson that if he passed all of the tests and had no
               alcohol in his system then he would be let go. I read Peterson
               his Miranda Rights, which he said he understood. I asked
               Peterson if keeping his rights in mind he still wanted to
               perform the tests and he said he did. I removed the handcuffs
               from Peterson. I administered the field sobriety tests on the
               east side of the roadway. The driveway was level and covered
               with gravel. Lighting was provided by headlights and my
               flashlight. The weather was clear with an approximate
               temperature of 80 degrees. Peterson was wearing a pair of
               shorts and canvas shoes. Peterson was not wearing a shirt. The
               first test I administered was the HGN. I told Peterson to stand
               with his feet together and his arms at his sides. I told
               Peterson to follow the tip of my pen with his eyes only with
               out moving his head. I held my pen approximately 12-15 inches
               in front of Peterson's face and administered the test. I
               checked Peterson's eyes and noticed they tracked equally and
               his pupils were of equal size. I did not see resting nystagmus
               in either eye. I saw a lack of smooth pursuit and a distinct
               and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes. I
               saw an immediate onset of nystagmus and vertical nystagmus in
               both eyes. The next test I administered was the walk and turn.
               I told Peterson to find an imaginary straight line and put his
               left foot on the line. I told Peterson to put his right foot in
               front of his left foot touching heel to toe and leave his arms
               down at his sides. I told Peterson to stay in that position
               while I explained the test. I told Peterson that when I tell
               him to begin, to take nine steps touching heel to toe, watching
               his feet as he walked and count each step out loud. I told
               Peterson that when he gets to step nine, to leave his lead foot
               in place and using his rear foot, take small steps around until
               facing the way he came. I told Peterson to take nine steps back
               touching heel to toe and counting each step out loud. I told
               Peterson that once he started, do not stop. I reminded Peterson
               to count each step out loud, keep his arms at his sides, and
               watch his feet as he walked. I demonstrated the test and asked
               Peterson if he understood and he said yes. I told Peterson to
               begin at any time. Instruction Phase: Peterson stood with his
               left foot in front of his right foot, which is opposite of what
               I demonstrated and explained. Peterson lost his balance in the
               starting position and moved his feet apart to regain his
               balance. Peterson then stood with his feet apart by
               approximately 3 inches. First Nine Steps: Peterson began the
               test and missed heel to toe between steps 1 and 2. Peterson
               continued the test and stopped on step 9 and raised his arm

               from his side. Peterson asked how to perform the turn and I
               told him to leave his front foot in place and take small steps
               with rear foot. Peterson then spun on his heels. Return Steps:
               Peterson raised his left arm from his side for balance on step
               3. The next test I administered was the one leg stand. I told
               Peterson to stand with his feet together and his arms at his
               sides. I told Peterson that when I tell him to begin to raise
               the foot of his choice approximately 6 inches off the ground. I
               told Peterson to point his toe forward, look at his foot, and
               count out loud by 1000's until I tell him to stop. I asked
               Peterson if he understood, and he said yes. I told Peterson to
               begin at any time. Peterson raised his left foot off the ground
               approximately 3 inches and was not looking at his foot. I
               reminded Peterson to look at his foot. Peterson swayed left to
               right during the test and raised his arms from his side for
               balance on his count of 1004, and then put his foot down.
               Peterson raised his foot and started counting from the
               beginning. Peterson again swayed and I noticed his raised leg
               was not straight. Peterson put his foot down on his count of
               1013 and then said "Fuck". At this point 30 seconds had
               elapsed. I asked Peterson if he would submit to a voluntary
               PBT. Peterson asked what would happen if he did not. I told
               Peterson he was still under arrest and would be regardless of
               the sample he provided. Peterson did not want to provide a
               sample. At this time it was my opinion that Peterson's ability
               to drive was impaired by alcohol. I put handcuffs back on
               Peterson (D/L) and reminded him that his rights still applied
               and also reminded him that he was being audio and video
               recorded. I placed Peterson in my patrol car. Ofc. Whitman
               remained on scene and facilitated the tow with Meyer's towing.
               I responded to Pullman PD for the BAC. I read Peterson his
               Constitutional Rights at 0138 hours. Peterson said he
               understood his rights and signed both signature blocks. I
               checked Peterson's mouth at 0139 hours, finding no foreign
               substance. I read Peterson his Implied Consent for Breath at
               0142 hours. Peterson signed that they were read to him. I asked
               Peterson if he would submit to a breath test and he checked the
               "yes" box and initialed next to it. Peterson said he understood
               the Implied Consent. I checked the Draeger Alcotest and found
               the breath tube warm to the touch. Peterson's first sample was
               .167 (IR) and .172 (EC) at 0159 hours. Peterson's second sample
               was .172 (IR) and .175 (EC) at 0202 hours. The breath test was
               administered in accordance to the methods approved by the
               Washington State Toxicologist pursuant to the Washington
               Administrative Code. I provided Peterson a copy of the
               following documents: Driver's Hearing Request, Notice of
               Hearing/Conditions of Release, Tow/Impound Form. I issued
               Peterson a criminal citation for DUI. I explained the citation
               to Peterson and gave him his copy. I processed Peterson and
               released him from custody. I returned to WSUPD and downloaded
               my video to the computer. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               28th day of June, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.
