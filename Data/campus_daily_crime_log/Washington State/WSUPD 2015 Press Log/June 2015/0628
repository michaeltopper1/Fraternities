               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2879 SYNOPSIS: Report of a panic alarm
               at the front desk of the Compton Union Building. Determined to
               be an employee error and no emergency. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE

               Olmstead and I were dispatched to the Compton Union Building
               (CUB)for a report of a panic alarm activation from the front
               desk. Upon my arrival I saw several people enter the building
               and there did not appear to be any alarm. I entered the
               building and was contacted by an employee, who was unidentified
               but I recognized from previous encounters at the CUB as an
               employee. This male told me he had accidentally activated the
               alarm and there was no emergency. I thanked him and after
               briefly checking the area I did not see anything of note before
               I cleared and notified Whitcom the cause of the alarm was an
               employee error. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 28th day of

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: mjp/327 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2884 SYNOPSIS: Report of "intoxicated
               male" on SR 27 near Rose Creek Rd. Contacted parties at their
               residence approximately 40 minutes after it was reported.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 062815
               at approximately 1710 hours I heard WCSO dispatched to a
               possibly impaired driver southbound on SR 27 near Rose Creek
               Rd. I knew PPD was busy and County was out of position so I
               asked Ofc. Kirshner if we could volunteer to assist. He said
               that would be fine and dispatch advised WSP and WCSO. WCSO
               requested we assist. The vehicle was reportedly driving slowly
               and looking for places to stop on the side of the road. I
               responded to the area and was unable to locate the vehicle.
               Dispatch had the license plate (WA/AUM3682). They were able to
               determine that Scott Robinson (012274) was associated with the
               vehicle and that he had caregivers in Palouse. I drove to
               Palouse-Albion Rd without finding any vehicle matching the
               description provided. As I returned to Pullman I came across an
               injured deer on the side of the road. Ofc. Kirshner was with me
               and we prepared to dispatch the deer as it limped off into the
               fields hundreds of meters away from the road. Ofc. Kirshner
               decided not to have the animal dispatched. We then went to
               Kenwood apartments where the RO of the vehicle, Michele A.
               Anderson (032867), was listed as living. We went to her
               apartment at 002 and got no response. Another resident informed
               us that Robinson lived at 210. We went to 210 and Robinson
               answered the door. He is listed as 220 in Spillman and his
               mannerisms and behavior reflected this. He denied having
               driven. Conversation was limited. I then spoke with Anderson
               who was in the room. She was more talkative but displayed
               abnormal behavior with eye contact and speech patterns. She
               said that she and Robinson had just driven from Palouse and
               that she had driven. She provided a voluntary breath sample of
               .000. She denied any drug use. Her eyes appeared to be very
               watery and bloodshot. I advised her as to why we had been
               called. We cleared. Nothing follows. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               28th day of June, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               Kuhrt, Ofc. Petlovany, Ofc. Whitman, and I responded to an
               intrusion alarm at the ORC. This alarm commonly goes off when
               high winds are present and they were at the time of the alarm.
               Cpl. Kuhrt and I searched the interior of the building as Ofc.

               search was completed, nobody was found inside. I found one
