    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Olmstead/339 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2588 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched to a
               report of a civil problem, and I provided assistance. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 06-01-2015 at
               about 1327 hrs I was dispatched to a report of a civil problem.
               I contacted the complainant, Elizabeth Kittisack (DOB 08-18-
               1995), on the telephone. Kittisack told me the following:
               Kittisack responded to an advertisement on Craigslist for a dog
               for sale. The price for the dog was listed as $100.00 in the
               advertisement. Kittisack conversed with the owner via text
               message and made arrangements to purchase the dog. On 05-31-
               2015 Kittisack met with a group of unknown individuals at the
               Taco Bell restaurant in downtown Spokane, Washington. A female
               in the group, who was identified only as "Noelle", gave the dog
               to Kittisack. Kittisack paid Noelle $100.00 for the dog, which
               was the price they had previously agreed upon. Kittisack
               returned home with the dog without further incident. On 06-01-
               2015 Kittisack received text messages on her cellular telephone
               from someone claiming to be Noelle's mother. The person stated
               that Kittisack needed to come to Spokane today and pay them
               $50.00 more for the dog, or they wanted the dog back. If
               Kittisack didn't pay, the person threatened to call the police.
               Kittisack identified the suspect telephone number as: 509-995-
               7316. Kittisack said the suspects did not know where she lived
               and only knew her telephone number, first name, and that she
               lived somewhere near Pullman, Washington. Kittisack requested
               assistance in dealing with the situation. I explained to
               Kittisack that she should keep the dog and instructed her to
               not pay any additional money for the dog. I told Kittisack to
               have no further communication with the suspects. I instructed
               Kittisack to contact the service provider for her cellular
               telephone and have the suspect number blocked. I told Kittisack
               that I would contact the suspects and tell them to have no
               further contact with her. Kittisack provided me with screen
               shots of the Craigslist advertisement and the text message
               conservation she had with the suspects. These images have been
               downloaded into Spillman and attached to this case. I told
               Kittisack to contact me immediately if she had any further
               problems with the suspects. I also cautioned Kittisack about
               purchasing items on Craigslist and the potential risks involved
               in this. I called the suspect telephone number and spoke with
               someone who identified herself as Noelle and another
               unidentified male who was also on the line. I warned Noelle
               about her behavior and told her to have no further contact with
