        Time Reported: 08:28
    Time Occurred between: 06:30:00 06/09/15 - 08:30:00 06/09/15

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Olmstead/339 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2668 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched to a
               report of malicious mischief in Sloan Hall. Offensive
               statements were written on a mirror. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 06-09-2015 at about 0828 hrs I
               was dispatched to a report of malicious mischief in Sloan Hall,
               located at 405 NE Spokane Street. Dispatch advised that someone
               had written an offensive statement on the mirror in the men's
               restroom on the 1st floor. I arrived on scene and located the
               damage. I saw that someone had used a black marker to write the
               following statements on the mirror in the restroom: "Islam is a
               death cult" "Mohammad was a pedophile and wore women's clothes"
               "He also had sex with his dead wife (her corpse)" The men's
               restroom is located across the hall from room #175. The damage
               is estimated to be $25.00 and occurred sometime between 0630
               hrs on 06-09-2015 and 0830 hrs on 06-09-2015. I photographed
               the damage, and the photographs have been downloaded into
               Spillman and attached to this case. WSU Facilities Operations
               is aware of the damage and will clean it up. This case is
               similar to several other incidents of malicious mischief in
               Sloan Hall that occurred during Fall 2014. No suspects or leads
               were identified. No further action at this time. Olmstead/339 I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this __09__ day of __June____, 2015, in Pullman,

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: JAK/333 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2676 SYNOPSIS: Whitcom received a report
               of someone having their car stolen. The reporting party called
               Whitcom back stating she realized a family member had taken the
               car and it was not stolen. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR#
               1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 06-09-15, at approximately 2102 hours,
               Regina C. Snider (05-20-93) called Whitcom stating her car was
               stolen sometime around 1700 hours. She said her gray 4 door
               Suzuki (WA/JV8961) had been parked in the Nez Perce Village
               Apartments parking lot near apartment T-87 and it was not
               missing. She said she is always careful about making sure her
               car windows are up and the doors are locked. She also said the
               only people besides herself who have keys to the car are a few
               family members. She said she had already contacted her family
               members and said none of them had the car. As I was driving to
               meet with Snider, she called Whitcom back stating one of her
               family members does have her car. She said she no longer needs
               the assistance of Law Enforcement. Nothing further. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.
               Dated this 9th day of June, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.
