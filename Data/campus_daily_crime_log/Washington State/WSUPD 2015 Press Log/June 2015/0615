               On 06/15/15 around 1440 I was asked by Ofc Breshears of the
               Pullman Police to help in confirming if a student who had been
               involved in a domestic dispute was returning for classes this
               fall. I contacted Breshears who explained he had been contacted
               by the prosecutors office regarding a case he had investigated.
               He went on to explain it had been a domestic dispute and he had
               been asked by the prosecutors office to try and locate the
               victim, Ae Rin Jung (10/12/82), whom he had been told had left
               the country and was not returning. I explained I was not able
               to release any information to him, unless he was requesting my
               assistance in helping to locate Jung. Breshears told me he
               would like my help and I told him I would get back to him. A
               short time after speaking with Breshears I learned Jung was
               scheduled to return for classes in August. I contacted
               Breshears and relayed this information to him. He thanked me
               for my assistance and I cleared a short time later. Nothing

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2741 SYNOPSIS: I responded to a kitchen
               fire at 775 SE Forest Way; Apartment 718, which resulted in the
               fire suppression sprinkler system activating. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 06-15-15, at
               approximately 1750 hours, I responded to a Fire Alarm at 775 SE
               Forest Way, from an unknown apartment in the "M" building. As I
               was on route, Whitcom advised there was an actual fire in the
               apartment. I activated my emergency overhead lights, my siren,
               and increased my speed. Upon my arrival I could see people
               standing outside of the "M" building. I took my fire
               extinguisher from the back of my patrol vehicle and responded
               to the area. I could see people carrying household items out of
               apartment 718. The Yakima Village Apartment Coordinator,
               Elizabeth Thomas (11-19-78), notified me the fire was out, but
               the fire suppression system had been activated. At this point,
               the City of Pullman Fire Department arrived on scene. They
               began trying to shut off the fire suppression system. I
               identified the occupant of apartment 718 as Pak Sing Choi (12-
               26-86). I asked Choi to tell me what happened. He said he was
               planning on cooking chicken on his stove top. He put some oil
               in a pot, covered it with a lid, and placed it on one of the
               burners, on medium heat. Choi said he lifted the lid in order
               to put the chicken in the oil and "It Exploded". I asked him to
               explain what he meant by "It Exploded" and he said as soon as
               he removed the lid, the oil came up and over the pot. It then
               ignited and caused a fire. Choi said he was able to put the
               fire out by using a fire extinguisher, but before he was able
               to do so, the fire suppression system activated and began
               spraying water everywhere in the apartment. The apartment
               occupants of apartments 717 and 719 said they did not see any
               damage to their apartments due to water. The apartment occupant
               of apartment 716 said there was water all over his apartment. I
               advised the occupant of apartment 716 to take pictures and
               document the cost of the damaged items. More to follow. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 15th day of June, 2015, in Pullman,

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2745 SYNOPSIS: One adult and three
               juveniles contacted for trespassing at Magpie Forest. The case
               was turned over to Pullman Police Department when marijuana was
               discovered in their car parked on Merman Drive. NAME/DOB ACTION

               Quinlan 07/14/99 NARRATIVE: On 06/16/15 at approximately 0005
               hours I was checking cars near Magpie Forest when I found a
               2003 Ford Crow Victoria near the entrance to Magpie Forest. The
               car was empty so I believed that there were people trespassing
               at Magpie Forest. I radioed Cpl. Kuhrt to respond so we could
               walk through the area. While waiting for Cpl. Kuhrt to arrive I
               stood outside my car on the sidewalk. I could hear several
               voices off in the distance. The voices grew louder and louder
               as a group of people walked through Magpie and towards their
               car. I saw four silhouettes on the hillside so I turned on my
               flashlight. I saw three males and one female standing at the
               entrance of Magpie. I asked the four to come talk to me and
               they walked over. I asked the group what they were doing at
               Magpie. They stated they were just walking around. I told the
               group that Magpie Forest closes as dusk. All four appeared to
               be very young. I asked for their ID's and several of them
               stated it was back in their car. We walked to the Crown
               Victoria and they began to look for their ID's. All four were
               later identified as Maxwell Andrew Villers 06/15/97 (18 years
               old), Dante Antonio Ungerer 11/05/97 (17 years old), Richard
               Brice Drowley 09/28/99 (15 years old), and Margaret Louise
               Quinlan 07/14/99 (15 years old). About this time Cpl. Kuhrt
               arrived on scene. Villers was sitting in the driver's seat and
               stated he could not find his ID. All three others provided
               their WADL's. Cpl. Kuhrt stated there he could see marijuana in
               a cupholder on the dash. I asked if anybody had a medical
               marijuana card and everybody said no. Villers said the car was
               not his. I asked who's car it was and Villers said it was his
               brother's car. I asked if Villers' brother had a medical
               marijuana card and he said no. I asked Villers to come talk to
               me away from the group. Once removed from the group I asked
               Villers about the marijuana. Villers again said it was his
               brother's, Landen. I asked if Landen would say it was his and
               Villers said yes. Villers provided me with Landen's phone
               number and I called it using Vehicle 17's cell phone. Nobody
               answered when I called. Villers and I walked over to the car
               and I asked if he could show me how much marijuana was in the

               car. Villers reached in and handed me a small plastic bottle
               that contained a green vegetable material that based on my
               training and experience I instantly recognized as marijuana. I
               asked Villers if they was any pipes in the car and he said no.
               Cpl. Kuhrt radioed dispatch to notify Pullman Police of what we
               were out with. Pullman PD stated they would send an Officer to
               handle the call. I had Cpl. Kuhrt walk to the hillside I first
               saw the four to make sure they did not drop anything. I ran all
               four through dispatch and all returned clear. About this time
               Cpl. Kuhrt returned stating he did not find anything. Cpl.
               Kuhrt stated he had seen a sandwich bag in the backseat but
               Quinlan had kicked it under the driver's side seat when she was
               sitting in the car. While Cpl. Kuhrt was saying this Quinlan
               threw her hands up in frustration and reached into the car and
               grabbed the sandwich bag from under the seat. Quinlan had the
               sandwich bag in her hand. The sandwich bag had a large bud of
               marijuana in it. Quinlan had her hand out and I took the bag. I
               heard Ofc. Cornish en route to the area so I stopped my
               investigation at that point. Once Ofc. Cornish arrived on scene
               I filled him in and he took over the case. Cpl. Kuhrt and I
               remained on scene until Ofc. Cornish completed his
               investigation. All the parents of the juveniles were contacted
               by Ofc. Cornish. END OF NARRATIVE I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 16th day of
               June, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.
