               assist. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 06/05/15 at approximately 1910 hours Ofc. Lambley called me
               at home and asked if I could respond to Pullman PD for a DRE
               evaluation for Ofc. Winegardner. I responded to Pullman PD and
               met with the subject, Jacob Elliott. Elliott had his head
               laying on the table of the BAC machine. I asked Elliott if he
               was awake and he gave me a thumbs up. I asked Elliott to raise
               his head, which he didn't do. I continued to ask him this for
               approximately 30 seconds and then tapped him on his arm with my
               pen. Elliott eventually raised his head and smirked at me.
               Elliott said, "My attorney said not to talk to you." and put
               his head back down. I asked Elliott if he wanted to talk with
               me and he said no. I put Elliott in a holding cell and cleared.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 5th day of June, 2015, in
               Pullman, Washington. _______________________________________

    Time Occurred between: 22:26:54 06/05/15 - 22:26:59 06/05/15

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Boyd/335 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2632 SYNOPSIS: WCSO requested an agency
               assist for a domestic dispute at 305 North Main in Albion.
               Officers responded and determined the issue to be verbal only.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               06/05/15 at about 2228 hrs Dispatch advised WCSO was requesting
               an agency assist and officers to respond to 305 North Main St.
               in Albion for a domestic dispute. Deputies had already been to
               the address once earlier in the day for a similar issue.
               Corporal Edwards and I responded. We contacted the complainant,
               Michael A. Nyberg (102861), who told me he was tired of his
               friend, Brianna M. Smith (102068), out of his house. Nyberg
               told me Smith had been living with him for about for years and
               he was tired of dealing with her. She has a history of drinking
               too much and throwing stuff around the house, breaking, and
               burning things inside the house. Smith had reportedly thrown a
               bunch of items from inside the house on to the front lawn.
               Nyberg said he just finished picking up the items before our
               arrival. I explained to Nyberg since Smith had established
               residency at the home we could not just remove her from the
               house. He said he understood because deputies had explained the
               issue to him in the past and encouraged him to get a
               restraining order. He started to do so but decided not to
               because he knew Smith did not have anywhere else to go. Nyberg
               said the items which Smith damaged/broke were all communal
               property owned by both of them. He said the argument never
               became physical. Corporal Edwards and I both attempted to speak
               with Smith. She was inside the house an refused to open the
               door because she thought she was going to be arrested. It was
               clear Smith was highly intoxicated and she was verbally
               uncooperative with us, refusing to answer questions. I provided
               Nyberg my business card and encouraged him to go through with
               the restraining order and eviction process if he was truly done
               with Smith and wished to move on from the problems she was
               causing. He said he was gong to do so. I offered to provide
               Nyberg with a transport to another location so he would not
               have to deal with Smith for the night. He told me he did not
               have anywhere else to go and did not want to leave. He planned
               to stay in his vehicle in the driveway for the night. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 05 day of June, 2015, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer
