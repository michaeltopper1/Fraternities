               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2785 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched to a
               report of malicious mischief in the parking lot of the Center
               for Undergraduate Education Building. The driver side window of
               a vehicle was broken and shattered. This could be related to
               several other recent incidents involving pellet gun damage.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 06-19-
               2015 at about 0812 hrs I was dispatched to a report of
               malicious mischief in the parking lot of the Center for
               Undergraduate Education Building (CUE), located at 300 NE Troy
               Lane. Dispatch advised that a vehicle had a broken window. I
               arrived on scene and located the vehicle, which was identified
               as a red, 1998 Nissan Frontier (ID Lic. N155242). The
               registered owner of the vehicle was identified as Jeffrey P.
               Guillory (DOB 02-23-1948). The vehicle was parked in the
               "green" parking lot located on the east side of the CUE
               Building. I saw that the driver side door window was broken and
               shattered. The damage is estimated to be $300.00 and occurred
               sometime between 1700 hrs on 06-18-2015 and 0800 hrs on 06-19-
               2015. I left my business card on the windshield of the vehicle,
               with instructions for Guillory to contact me. I photographed
               the damage, and the photographs have been downloaded into
               Spillman and attached to this case. This incident might be
               related to several other recent cases involving damaged
               vehicles and businesses on campus and around Pullman, including
               the Fine Arts Building Parking Garage. For more information see
               related cases, 15-W2784 and 15-P05780. Video surveillance
               cameras are posted at the intersection of Stadium Way and
               Grimes Way and at the entrance to the Fine Arts Building
               Parking Garage. I will submit a request to WSU Information
               Technology for video surveillance footage from these cameras
               between the following times: 2200 hrs on 06-18-2015 and 0600
               hrs on 06-19-2015. The footage will be reviewed with the hope
               of identifying a suspect vehicle entering and/or exiting the
               Fine Arts Building Parking Garage. Investigation continues.

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Olmstead/339 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2785 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched to a
               report of reckless endangerment. The complainant reported that
               eggs had been thrown at him as he was riding his bicycle on
               Stadium Way. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 06-19-2015 at about 0908 hrs I was dispatched to
               a report of reckless endangerment on Stadium Way. Dispatch
               advised that the complainant, Jared J. Chastain (DOB 01-24-
               1986), reported he had been riding his bicycle on Stadium Way
               and had been hit with an egg. I contacted Chastain on the
               telephone. Chastain stated that on 06-19-2015 at about 0900 hrs
               he had been riding his bicycle eastbound on Stadium Way in the
               bike lane near Taco Bell, located at 435 NE Stadium Way.
               Chastain said he felt something hit his left arm. He looked
               down and saw eggs shells, clear fluid, and egg yolk on his arm
               and bicycle. Chastain saw a vehicle drive past him and noticed
               that the occupants appeared to be throwing eggs at other
               vehicles. Chastain said he could see some type of object, which
               he thought were eggs or rocks, being thrown from inside the
               vehicle. Chastain said both front and rear passenger side door
               windows on the vehicle were down. Chastain said the vehicle was
               occupied by three, college aged males with dark hair. Chastain
               described the vehicle as a large SUV similar to a Ford
               Excursion. Chastain described the color of the vehicle as light
               brown, gold, or beige. Chastain was not able to obtain the
               license plate for the vehicle and last saw it traveling on
               Stadium Way near Perham Hall. I asked Chastain if he
               experienced any physical pain when he was struck by the egg.
               Chastain said it felt like a "hard object" hit his arm, but it
               was not painful. Chastain explained that he is an experienced
               bicyclist and in good physical shape. He did not swerve or
               crash when hit by the egg but speculated that a lesser rider
               could have fallen to the ground or swerved into traffic and
               been struck by a vehicle. Chastain said he is a manager for
               Munchyz (902 NE Colorado Street), and after being hit by the
               egg, he rode his bicycle there. Chastain said he took some
               photographs of the egg residue on his bicycle and then sprayed
               it off with a hose. Chastain forwarded the photographs to me,
               and the photographs have been downloaded into Spillman and
               attached to this case. While at Munchyz, Chastain spoke with
               his supervisor, Robert W. Cady (DOB 12-31-1976), and Cady saw
               the egg residue on Chastain's bicycle. Chastain said if the
               suspects were located, he wished to pursue criminal charges
               against them. Chastain explained that throwing an egg at

               someone might seem harmless, but it could have caused him to
               crash on his bicycle, swerve into traffic, or get injured.
               Officers from WSUPD and Pullman PD searched the area, but the
               suspect vehicle was not located. While taking the report, I
               realized the incident had occurred in Pullman PD's
               jurisdiction. I contacted Officer Umbright on the telephone and
               discussed the incident with him. It was decided that I would
               take the report as an agency assist, and a case would also be
               generated for Pullman PD, 15-P05788. Sergeant Jacobson
               suggested that I contact Dissmore's IGA, located at 1205 North
               Grand Avenue, to determine if three males had purchased eggs at
               the store prior to Chastain's incident. I contacted Dissmore's
               owner, Archie E. McGregor (DOB 02-03-1961), on the telephone. I
               explained the situation to him and requested that he check the
               store's video surveillance system. At about 1300 hrs McGregor
               called back and explained he had determined that four college
               aged males had purchased two, 18 egg cartons at Dissmore's at
               about 0857 hrs this morning. McGregor said the males were
               driving a large, light colored SUV. McGregor said the males
               told the cashier that they were football players. McGregor
               copied the video surveillance from inside the store and in the
               parking lot onto a disc, and at about 1330 hrs, I picked up the
               disc from the customer service counter at Dissmore's. I
               returned to the police department and viewed the video
               surveillance footage on the disc. The video surveillance
               footage showed four college aged males arriving at the
               Dissmore's parking lot in a large, light colored SUV. I saw
               that the males purchased two cartons of eggs at the register.
               The males are described as follows: Suspect #1: black male,
               gray hoodie, gray shorts Suspect #2: white male, baseball cap,
               bright colored shirt, shorts Suspect #3: black male, long black
               hair pulled back, gray WSU Cougar shirt Suspect #4: white male,
               brown hair, gray shirt, WSU Cougar shorts I used the Microsoft
               Snipping Tool to create several images of the males from the
               video surveillance footage. The images have been downloaded
               into Spillman and attached to this case. The video surveillance
               disc was later logged into evidence. Investigation continues.

               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On June 19, 2015 at about
               1742 hours Pullman Police were dispatched to a traffic offense
               on Grand Ave. The vehicle was southbound from Albion Road. As I
               was traveling north on Grand Ave near Turner I saw the vehicle.
               In addition there was a car following the vehicle that flagged
               me down gesturing toward it. I followed the vehicle through
               Pullman on Grand Ave. I did not observe any traffic violations.
               The vehicle eventually stopped at 515 SW Shirley where I made a
               social contact with the male driver. He told me he had just got
               off of work at DSHS in Colfax. He took Albion Road to Pullman
               due to the construction. He said there was vehicle that passed
               him because he was doing the speed limit. I was also told that
               his backpack fell and he picked it up as he drove. There were
               no indications of impairment or welfare issues. The male driver
               was not identified. I notified Pullman Police Officer Emerson
               of my contact as he was responding from across town. Assistance
               provided, no further investigation. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 19th day of
               June, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2792 06/19/15 SYNOPSIS: Agency assist
               for Whitman County Sheriff's Office at 305 North Main Street in
               Albion for a domestic dispute. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On June 19, 2015 at about 1814
               hours Whitman County Sheriff's Deputies were dispatched to an
               open 911 call that sounded like a domestic dispute at 305 North
               Main Street in Albion. Deputies Langerveld requested an agency
               assist as both deputies were responding from the north part of
               the county. Cpl. Edwards and I responded to the residence. We
               were the first units on scene. As we exited our vehicles an
               approached the residence I could hear a male voice yelling and
               a female screaming and crying coming from 305 North Main. It
               sounded like the female was screaming for "help." There was a
               DVD and other household items strewn out in the front yard and
               walkway. We went to the front door that was open and could see
               a male on top of a female inside the home. The male was later
               identified as Nyberg, Michael A. (10/28/61). The female was
               later identified as Smith, Brianna M. (10/20/68). Smith was
               sitting on her rear with her back up against the wall. Her legs
               were out straight. Nyberg appeared to be pinning her legs down
               by kneeling over her legs. Cpl Edwards ordered the Nyberg to
               get off of Smith several times at gun point. He yelled back
               "Fuck!" After additional commands Nyberg finally stood up and
               said "Fuck she just...fuck now were both going to jail." He got
               up off of Smith and moved over to the couch where he sat down.
               As we stood in the doorway I could not easily enter the house.
               A large black shelving unit had been tipped over at the
               doorway. There were at least a hundred DVD's, dirt from plants,
               and glass scattered over the floor. The shelf had broken apart,
               pieces were everywhere. There I moved pieces of the shelves to
               enter the home. I detained Nyberg and handcuffed him behind his
               back. I escorted Nyberg out of the house to the driveway. He
               had blood on his left cheek, left ear, left eye lid, and
               forehead. There was an obvious bump on his forehead about the
               size of a quarter. When I handcuffed him I could see dried
               blood on his hands. There was no obvious injury to his hands. I
               could smell the odor of alcohol coming from Nyberg's breath as
               he spoke to me. His speech was slurred as he spoke. I asked
               Nyberg several times if he needed medical attention. He refused
               every time I asked him. I asked him to tell my what happened.
               He seemed a bit confused about the question. He wanted to know
               who called the police. Nyberg eventually told me he was
               sleeping on the couch as he works graveyard at SEL. He said he

               woke up to Smith hitting him. Nyberg later admitted to drinking
               all day as it was a Friday. I read Nyberg his Constitutional
               Rights which he acknowledged and agreed to continue talking to
               me. I told him he was being detained at this time and not under
               arrest. When Deputy DeRosier and Deputy Langerveld arrived on
               scene I briefed them on what I had learned. I placed Nyberg in
               the back of Deputy DeRosier's vehicle. Nyberg told me that he
               was hit by Smith and he hit her back. Nyberg repeatedly asked
               for his glasses and his cell phone as he wanted to call his
               lawyer Mike Pettit to get him out of jail. His glasses were
               located and I put them on for him. We were unable to locate his
               cell phone. I told him multiple times that he can call Pettit
               from the jail as they have his phone number. Deputy Langerveld
               advised Nyberg that he was under arrest. I advised Nyberg that
               he was being audio and video recorded. Assistance was provided.
               No further investigation. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 19th day of June,
               2015, in Pullman, Washington.
