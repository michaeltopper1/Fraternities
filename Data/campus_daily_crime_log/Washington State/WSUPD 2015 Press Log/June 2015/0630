               DEPARTMENT ** COLLISION REPORT ** CASE #: 15-W2911 SYNOPSIS:
               Report of a semi truck which struck a sprinkler head in the
               ceiling of the Holland Parking Garage causing water flow.
               DRIVER 1: ID. Laird, Jeffrey S (06/12/61) VEHICLE 1: Wa.
               32508RP INSURANCE: Continental Western Insurance Company POLICY
               #: MCP6006707-23 EXP: 06/01/16 DAMAGE: None DRIVER 2: VEHICLE
               2: INSURANCE: DAMAGE: WITNESS(ES): NARRATIVE: On 06/30/15
               around 1152 hrs I was advised by Whitcom of a semi truck (Wa.
               32508RP) which had struck a sprinkler head while backing into
               the loading dock in the Holland Parking Garage. Upon my arrival
               I could see water spraying from the ceiling and forming a large
               pool on the floor. I walked up and could not locate the driver
               and spoke with a Facilities Operations employee, who told me
               the driver had struck a sprinkler head extending from the
               ceiling, which caused it to activate. The driver exited his
               vehicle and I was told he would be back. I looked at the
               ceiling and could see where several ceiling tiles along with
               the insulation had become soaked and fallen onto the vehicle,
               which had not been damaged, or down onto the ground which was
               pooling with water. I returned to my vehicle and began
               photographing the scene when the driver, later identified as
               Jeffery S Laird (06/12/61), returned. When I spoke with him he
               told me he has made deliveries to this location previously and
               never had an issue. He went on to explain he had a shorter
               trailer due to the tight turning radius. Laird went on to tell
               me was using an air ride trailer and when he began backing,
               which he had no issue with, he neared the loading dock. As he
               was backing in he struck the sprinkler head hanging from the
               ceiling and immediately stopped. The result of the collision
               was what I observed upon my arrival. Around this point I asked
               Laird for his drivers license, registration, and proof of
               insurance. Pullman Fire also arrived around this time and began
               to shut off the sprinklers. Laird returned a short time later
               with the information I requested and I returned to my vehicle
               to note the necessary information. I returned a short time
               later and after some of the ceiling tiles had been removed from
               the roof of the trailer noticed the difference in height
               between the front of the trailer to the ceiling and the rear. I
               estimated the difference to be around 3-5 inches and after the
               semi had been pulled forward took several more photos of the
               damage, which I estimated to be around $900.00. Upon finishing
               of taking photos of the damage I spoke with Laird again and
               provided him with my business card and case number for

               reference. I told Laird all of the information and photographs
               I had taken would be contained within this case. Laird was also
               told if he or his supervisor had any questions to give me a
               call and was told he would. I cleared a short time later and
               returned to the WSU Police Department. I returned to the
               Holland Garage sometime later and noted there were no height
               clearance signs from the entrance up to the loading dock. The
               only clearance signs I found were leading from the drive up to
               the upper level and one leading down to the lower level. I
               cleared a short while later and returned to the WSU Police
               Department and completed the necessary paperwork before
               clearing the call. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 30th day of
               June, 2015 in Pullman, Washington.

               phone I got a call from Gary Collins who described the phone
               perfectly and said he had lost it in the yellow #1 parking lot
               by Beasley. Mr. Collins said he had to teach a class and then
               he would stop by and claim his phone. Maeleen released the

               social media web sites for the past two years back home.
               Subject wanted to give the police department a heads up in case
               the harassment continues, when her daughter attends WSU in the
               Fall. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE:
               **Report not finished** On 06-30-15 at approximately 1313 hours
               dispatched advised complainant, Stephanie L. Schuldt (DOB 08-
               19-70), was waiting in the front lobby of the police department
               requesting to speak to an officer about her daughter. I met
               with Stephanie in the front lobby, and I spoke with her in the
               interview room. Stephanie told me she has already spoken with
               Karen Fischer, from WSU Dean of Students Office, but Fischer
               said she should notify us as well. Stephanie said her daughter,
               Allison N. Schuldt (DOB 12-31-96), has been stalked and
               harassed for the past two years, and they do not know who is
               doing it. Stephanie said they have been receiving letters
               through the mail at their home address in Bothell, Washington.
               Stephanie said the letters are trying to make Allison look bad.
               Stephanie mentioned none of the letters have been handwritten,
               they were all typed. She said her family thought it may have
               been someone jealous over the boy Allison was dating at the
               time. However, Stephanie said Allison and him broke up and the
               letters continued to come. She said they moved to a new house
               in Snohomish, Washington and a letter showed up just a couple
               months after they moved in. Stephanie said she has personally
               received letters at her work, and whoever it is knows she is a
               Kindergarten Teacher. She told me they also know where her
               husband works and they have sent letters there as well.
               Stephanie said as soon as she thinks the letters have finally
               stopped, another letter arrives. She said Allison's employer
               began to receive these letters as well. The letters contained
               numerous complaints about Allison saying they were disgruntled
               customers. Stephanie said the letters started coming June, 2013
               and the last one they received was on April, 2015. Stephanie
               has already reported this to Snohomish County, but she just
               wanted to give us a heads up because Allison will be attending
               WSU in the Fall. I asked Stephanie to please email me copies of
               some of the letters they have been receiving, and she said she
               would. My Vievu camera was activated, and the video has been
               downloaded into the permanent digital evidence folder. The
               investigation continues. I certify and declare under penalty of

               approximately 1526 hours I was dispatched the report of theft
               of a parking pass from a vehicle. Dispatched advised the
               complainant, Deven R. See (DOB 07-11-66), was requesting to be
               contacted via phone. At about 1533 hours I called See on the
               phone. I asked See what happened. See told me he returned to
               his white, 2009 Subaru Legacy (ID Lic. 1LA8014) parked in the
               green 1 parking lot by Ferdinand's Lane at about 1515 hours and
               noticed he had a parking ticket. See said that is when he
               noticed his green parking pass was stolen. I asked See when he
               remembers last seeing his parking pass, but he did not
               remember. He told me he parked in the same parking lot all day
               on 06-29-15 and did not receive a ticket, so he thinks it was
               still there. I asked See if he remembers locking his vehicle,
               and he told me he did not know. See told me there was no damage
               to his vehicle and nothing else appeared to be missing. See
               said his wife drove his vehicle in the evening of 06-30-15 and
               may have not locked the vehicle. I gave See the case number,
               and told him if he happened to find his parking pass he needed
               to contact Parking Services. I called parking services and
               asked if they could give me See's parking permit number.
               Parking services told me his permit number was #GN10553 and the
               current value of the permit is $99.49. No suspects or leads at
               this time. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true

               Grover 12/11/84 Cite/Release DWLS 5Z0766653 2. NARRATIVE: On
               07/01/15 at approximately 0150 hours I was parked in the
               parking lot of Kamiak Apts. off of NE Valley Rd monitoring
               traffic. I saw the defendant's vehicle traveling west past my
               location. I noticed as the vehicle slowed down, the passenger's
               side brake light did not illuminate as the others did. I got
               behind the vehicle and activated my emergency lights, stopping
               the vehicle on NE Stadium way at Monroe St. I activated my
               VieVu camera. I noticed the tabs on the registration were
               expired 7/14. I contacted the driver and advised him the stop
               was being recorded as well as the reason for the stop. I asked
               for his license, registration, and proof of insurance. The
               driver provided me with his license and registration, but
               couldn't find his insurance. The driver was identified as
               Willie I. Grover 12/11/84 by his Oregon license. I returned to
               my vehicle and ran his license and plate through Whitcom.
               Whitcom radioed that Grover was suspended in Oregon and
               Washington. Whitcom radioed that the plate was expired in July
               of 2014. I returned to Grover's vehicle and advised him of the
               suspension. I told Grover he was under arrest and had the right
               to counsel. I reminded Grover that he was being recorded. I
               told Grover to attempt and find a legal driver while I
               completed his citation. I issued Grover a criminal citation for
               DWLS and an infraction for expired registration. I explained
               both to Grover and provided him his copies. I parked Grover's
               car in the McDonald's parking lot. I returned to WSUPD and
               downloaded the videos to the computer. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 1st day of July, 2015, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer

               NARRATIVE: On 07/01/15 at approximately 0230 hours I was parked
               in the lot of Kamiak Apts. off of NE Valley Rd. monitoring
               traffic. The defendant's vehicle was traveling eastbound
               towards my location. I activated my radar (Veh 7) and it
               displayed a speed of 35MPH in a 25MPH speed zone. I caught up
               to the vehicle and activated my emergency lights, stopping on
               NE Merman near Garden Ave (1400 blk). I activated my VieVu
               camera. I contacted the driver and advised him of the reason
               for the stop and that I was recording. I asked for his license,
               registration, and proof of insurance. The driver provided me
               with his Kuwait license and the registration. The driver told
               me he did not have insurance because he only had his vehicle
               for 1 month. I looked at his registration and asked if the
               vehicle was registered to him and he said it was. I pointed out
               that the vehicle was registered in March of 2015, which is more
               than 1 month. The driver told me that he had the vehicle since
               2014, but has only been back for 1 month. I noticed the driver
               was identified as Meshari H. Alemtairy 09/12/94 by his Kuwait
               license, but the registration spelled his name Meshari
               Almutairi. I returned to my vehicle and ran Meshari through
               Whitcom with both spellings. Whitcom radioed that with the
               spelling of Almutairi, he is suspended in Idaho. The dates of
               birth matched. I returned to Meshari and asked if he knew his
               license was suspended in Idaho and he said he did not and asked
               what it was for. Whitcom radioed that it was for failure to
               appear on a no proof of insurance ticket. Meshari told me that
               he paid that ticket. I confirmed with Meshari that he did
               indeed receive a ticket for no insurance and he said that was
               correct. I told Meshari that his privileges to drive are
               suspended, there fore he was under arrest. I advised Meshari of
               his right to counsel and reminded him he was being recorded. I
               issued Meshari a criminal citation for DWLS and an infraction
               for No proof of insurance. I explained both tickets to him and
               provided him with his copies. I told Meshari he was free to go.
               The passenger in the vehicle switched seats and drove. I
               returned to WSUPD and downloaded the video to the computer.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 1st day of July, 2015, in
