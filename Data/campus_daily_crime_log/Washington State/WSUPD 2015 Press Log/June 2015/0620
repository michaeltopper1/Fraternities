               to a request for assistance in retrieving a key from an
               exterior door lock of Cleveland Hall which had become stuck. I
               contacted the reporting party, later identified as Lynn M
               Becerra (09/12/84), who explained her key had become stuck. She
               added it still functioned to unlock the door, but she was not
               able to remove it from the lock. I walked over to the key and
               noticed as she was trying to remove the key and the lock was
               not disengaged. I asked her to let me try the key and removed
               it from the lock before explaining what I had seen. The key was
               turned back over to Becerra, who apologized for the problem,
               and I cleared a short time later. Nothing further. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC:MTK/336 ********JUVENILE INVOLVED******* WASHINGTON
               STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #:15-W2800 SYNOPSIS:
               Subject reported a sex offense that occurred approximately 2
               years ago in Kennewick WA. Information forwarded to Kennewick
               PD. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.Clarity S. Botu
               10/19/98 Victim Rape of a child 3rd 2. Deejay Fisher Suspect
               NARRATIVE: On 06/20/15 at approximately 2252 hours I was
               dispatched to a sex offense at Gannon-Goldsworthy Lobby. I met
               with the reporting party, Brianna Fischer, outside of Gannon
               Hall. Fischer and another subject, Claire Bickel, walked with
               me to room 123. Fischer explained that she is a staff member
               with HOBY (Hugh Obrien Youth Leadership). Fischer said two of
               the other staff members were notified of a sex offense and
               because of the nature, they wanted to report it. I later
               learned that Bickel is the Leadership Chair of the seminar.
               Three other people arrived in the room and were identified as
               Clarity Botu (victim), Jordan Jungwirth (staff), and Rachel
               Fricke (staff). I asked Botu if she wanted everyone present
               while we spoke. Botu asked Bickel and Fischer to leave the
               room, which they did. I asked Botu to tell me what happened.
               Botu explained that when she was either 13 or 14 she frequented
               the Vista Youth Center in Kennewick (now called Quest Youth
               Center). Botu explained that while she was there she met a
               subject named Deejay Fisher (a 21 year old male). Botu said
               that she and Fischer began talking with each other and would go
               out for food. Botu explained that after a couple weeks, their
               relationship became flirtatious in nature. Botu said that she
               would sit on Fisher's lap. Botu said that she eventually
               initiated a kiss with Fisher, which she indicated occurred
               approximately 3 weeks after meeting. Botu said that the
               relationship turned sexual in nature, but they never had sex.
               Botu said she had performed oral sex on Fisher, but couldn't
               remember if he did on her. Botu said that Fisher had "fingered"
               (digitally penetrated her vagina) more than once. I asked Botu
               where this took place and she explained that it occurred at the
               strip mall where the Vista Youth Center was located. Botu
               explained that she wanted to end the relationship she was
               having with Fisher, because of his age as well as the fact she
               was in a long distance relationship. Botu said that Fisher
               showed up high (presumably at the Youth Center, but I did not
               specify) and attempted to kiss her. Botu said she told him
               several times no, and then said, "If this continues, this is
               rape." At this point Botu said Fisher backed off. Botu said she
               had not have further contact with Fisher. Botu told me that she

               told her mother about the things that happened between her and
               Fisher. Botu explained that she did not want any investigation
               to occur. Botu said the only reason she spoke with me was
               because she knew the HOBY staff had to report it to the police.
               I told Botu I was going to forward the case to the Kennewick
               Police department and it would be up to them how they would
               proceed with the case. Botu asked if she could later report the
               incident. I explained that felonies are prosecutable up to 3
               years after the commission. I realized later since the crime
               was actually Rape of a Child 3rd, the statute of limitations
               was much longer, which I sent Botu an email explaining. I
               attached the email to the case. Botu was uncertain on exact
               dates, or even rough time frames. Botu thought that she was 14
               when the acts occurred because she was fairly sure you had to
               be 14 to go to the Youth Center. I asked Botu if she had any
               further questions and she said no. Case to be forwarded to
               Kennewick PD. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 21st day of June, 2015, in
               Pullman, Washington. _______________________________________

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2801 SYNOPSIS: Subject arrested, cited,
               and released for DWLS 3rd Degree. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Hamed R. Al Shamaki 07/08/93 Cited/Released
               DWLS 3rd 2. NARRATIVE: On 06/20/15 at approximately 2353 hours
               I was parked along the side of the roadway on Terre View near
               Chief Joseph apartments facing eastbound. I was monitoring
               traffic on Terre View when I noticed a black sedan heading
               westbound on Terre View near the entrance to Palouse Ridge Golf
               Course. The sedan appeared to be traveling faster than the
               posted 35 MPH zone. I activated my handheld radar (Decatur
               Scout 2013) and obtained a reading of 45 MPH. Once the sedan
               reached my location I initiated a traffic stop. I contacted the
               driver, Hamed Rashid H. Al Shamaki 07/08/93, identified myself,
               informed Hamed I was recording, and explained the reason for
               the stop. I asked for Hamed's drivers license and he began to
               thumb through his wallet. I noticed Hamed passed over two
               Washignton ID cards. I told Hammed where his ID's were and he
               handed me an invalid Washington Driver's license and an expired
               Washington Driver's Permit. Hamed began to tell me that he was
               recently stopped in Spokane and so he was going to take care of
               his license. I did not follow what Hamed was telling me but he
               handed me a Sector citation of the dash of his car. The
               citation stated that Hamed had been cited for DWLS 3rd degree
               in Spokane a month earlier. While talking to Hamed I noticed
               Hamed's passenger, Fnu Qasim Mustafa Ali 07/10/93 was holding
               an infant in his lap. I asked Hamed why the infant was not in a
               car seat. Hamed took this as me asking why the infant was not
               in the backseat. Hamed told me he could not put his child in
               the backseat because she would slide all around because she was
               so small. I explained what a child safety seat was and again
               asked why he was not using one. Hamed said in his country they
               do not use child safety seats. I returned to my patrol car and
               ran Hamed through dispatch. Dispatch stated Hamed was suspended
               in the 3rd degree through Washington. About this time Ofc.
               Petlovany arrived on scene. I filled out a Sector citation for
               DWLS 3rd degree, Speeding, and not using a child restraint
               seat. I returned to Hamed and explained the citations. Hamed
               stated he understood and I provided him with his copies. I told
               Hamed that he needed to get a child safety seat immediately
               before he returned to Moscow, ID. I told Hamed that Walmart was
               still open and he could purchase one there. Ali had a valid
               driver's license so he took over driving. Ali, Hamed, and the
               infant drove off and I cleared. END OF REPORT I certify and
