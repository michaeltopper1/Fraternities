               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2708 SYNOPSIS: A WSU Summer Teaching
               Assistant came to the WSU Police Department to get advice on
               how to deal with a possibly irritated parent. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 06-12-15, at
               approximately 1304 hours, Evan T. Olds (08-11-83), came to the
               WSU Police Department to ask advice on how to deal with a
               possibly irritated parent. Olds explained he is a Summer
               Teaching Assistant and has a student in one of his classes,
               Alexander Jones, who asked to be allowed to register for
               another lecture class that is held at the same time as the one
               Olds teaches. Olds said he spoke with Jones' Academic Advisor
               then initially advised Jones he did not think it was a good
               idea. Olds gave this advice in the form of an e-mail, which
               Jones forwarded on to his father, Claus Jones. Olds said Claus
               became upset and began an e-mail conversation with him.
               Eventually Olds told Claus he still thought it was not in
               Alexander's best interest to enroll in both classes, he would
               grant the permission. Olds said Claus sent him an e-mail
               stating he was very "Pissed Off" and was coming to see him on
               Monday (06-15-15). I asked Olds if Claus used any words that
               were threatening and he said "No". I asked Olds if he was
               afraid of Claus and he said "I'm not sure what to think". Olds
               said he has 2 classes to teach on Monday and wanted to know if
               Officers could be in the area of his classes just in case Claus
               showed up. I asked him when and where the classes he was
               teaching were going to be. He said both classes would be held
               in Sloan Hall. Once class was from 1030 - 1145 in room 163 and
               the other from 1330 - 1445 in room 161. I told Olds I would
               send an e-mail to our Officers, making them aware of the
               possible situation and asking them to be in the are of Sloan
               Hall on Monday at the class times. I asked Olds to forward all
               e-mails sent between he, Alexander, and Claus so I could attach
               them to the case. He said he would send them to me as soon as
               he got home. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this ____ day of _____________,
