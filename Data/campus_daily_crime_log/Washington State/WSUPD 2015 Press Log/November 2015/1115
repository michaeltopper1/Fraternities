               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5831 SYNOPSIS: Report that a female
               accidentally left her necklace in the visitor volleyball locker
               room when her team was here playing WSU. The necklace was
               located and placed in evidence to be mailed back to her.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 111515
               at approximately 1544 hours, I was dispatched to contact Deanna
               O. Burgess regarding a necklace that her daughter left in the
               visitors' locker room when Stanford volleyball team played the
               WSU Cougars earlier in the day. Deanna told me I could call her
               daughter Jordan to clarify where exactly the necklace was left
               in the locker room. I contacted Jordan Burgess who told me she
               left the necklace in the third locker on the left as you enter
               the locker room, and it was hanging on a coat hook in the
               locker. I responded to Bohler Gym and contacted an athletic
               trainer who told me the visitor volleyball locker room they use
               is the old football locker room. I went to the old WSU Football
               locker room, checked the locker Jordan directed me to and
               located a small silver necklace with a single diamond in the
               middle of a round silver setting. I contacted Jordan and
               advised her I located her necklace. She asked me to have it
               mailed to her mother Deanna in Florida. Jordan provided the
               address for Deanna which matched the address Deanna provided
               dispatch. I contacted Deanna and told her I found the necklace.
               I explained that I was going to place the necklace in evidence
               and she should contact the WSU Police Department Evidence
               Custodian for arrangements on having it shipped back to her.
               Deanna told me she would call in the morning. I returned to the
               police department and completed the evidence form for found
               property. I placed the item in an envelope in locker #20.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing

               about 2143 hrs Dispatch advised of a report from hall staff in
               Goldsworthy Hall regarding the odor of marijuana coming from
               room 308. I responded and upon my arrival at room 308 could
               smell the odor of burnt marijuana emitting from the room. I
               knocked on the door and heard a male voice say "who is it?". I
               did not respond. I knocked a second time and again the male
               voice asked who was at the door. After a third knock a male,
               later identified as John J. Bruning, answered the door. I could
               see two more males in the room, later identified as William
               M.N. Nguyen and Zachariah M. Fullerton, and asked all of them
               to step out. I could see Nguyen had a vaporizer pen in his hand
               and the room was full of a hazy substance, which appeared to be
               exhaled vapor from the "vape pen". I told them I was there
               because their room smelled like marijuana. All three subjects
               denied smoking marijuana in the room. Through the open door I
               could see what I recognized to be a "smoke buddy" which is a
               hand held charcoal filter that is commonly used to exhale smoke
               through in an attempt to cover the odor of marijuana usage. I
               told Nguyen, Fullerton, and Bruning I saw the smoke buddy and
               could smell the odor of marijuana. They denied smoking
               marijuana in the room and said there was not any marijuana in
               the room. I asked if they would allow me to check the room and
               they said no. I told them the incident would be referred to
               student conduct because based on my observations I believed
               they were not being truthful with me. Nguyen was warned for
               using the vape pen in the room, which is a violation of housing
               policy. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 16 day of November,
               2015, in Pullman, Washington.
