               On 11-11-15 at about 0831 hours I was dispatched to the report
               of a lockout at the CUE building. The RP advised that she had
               room 512 reserved for meetings but the building was locked
               because of the holiday. I responded to the CUE and met with a
               large group. One of the group members showed me an email which
               confirmed their reservation for room 512 on 11-11-15. I
               unlocked the building and room for the group. I did not
               identify the female that showed me the email. Nothing further.

               booked into Whitman County Jail. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Alisha M. Burns/06-14-94 Booked Assault 4 DV
               Mal. Misc 3 DV 2. NARRATIVE: On 11-11-15 at about 1209 hours
               WSU units were emergency dispatched to a physical fight in
               progress between a girlfriend and boyfriend at Chief Joseph
               Apartment, #E11. The RP, Jamie Jones, is the roommate of the
               arresstee, Alicia Burns. Jones called stating that Burns was
               physically fighting with her boyfriend, Byron Howell, inside
               the apartment. Jones had locked herself in her bedroom but
               could hear items being thrown and somebody getting hit.
               Assistant Chief Hansen, Officer Jones and I responded. I was
               the first Officer on scene and was let into the apartment by
               Jones. When I walked in I could see a female (Burns) and male
               (Howell) standing in the doorway of Burns's bedroom. I could
               see that Burns was crying and that the vest Howell was wearing
               had two large tears in the front of it, with the stuffing
               spilling out. I asked to speak with Burns while Hansen spoke to
               Howell and Ofc. Jones spoke with RP Jones. I asked Burns to
               tell me what happened. She did not want to talk to me. I could
               see that she had long acrylic nails, several of which were
               broken. I asked how that happened and she said they had been
               that way since Halloween. Burns denied any sort of physical
               altercation and wanted to take a shower. She was very upset and
               not cooperating with the investigation. Ofc. Jones waited with
               Burns while I spoke to RP Jones. I asked Jones to explain what
               happened. She said that the fighting between Burns and Howell
               started at about 1130. She said that she could hear them
               arguing about Howell cheating on Burns. She said that argument
               continued to escalate to the point where she did not feel safe
               in the home. She said that she heard somebody being hit, but
               was not sure who it was. Jones said she could hear Burns
               yelling at Howell about cheating on her and assumed it was
               Burns who was hitting Howell since she did not hear Howell say
               anything. Jones said that this is not the first time the two
               have been physical with each other and that they have a very
               unhealthy relationship. Jones said that two weeks ago Burns was
               assaulted by Howell's roommate (the incident was never
               reported) but that Burns continues to go back to Howell because
               he gives her attention. She said it has been this way "forever"
               and she does not want Howell at her apartment because it is
               starting to affect her school work. I then went outside to

               speak with Howell and Hansen. Howell told me that he did not
               hit, punch, strike, kick, or trip Burns. He said that Burns was
               upset with him about cheating on her and that is what they were
               arguing about. He told me that Burns hit him several times,
               both with a closed fist and with open hand slaps. He said he
               was not really injured but that his face was sore. Hansen then
               advised that while he was speaking with Howell he noticed him
               rubbing his cheek where he advised he had been hit. Howell said
               that he was punched with a closed fist on his cheek. I asked
               Howell about his ripped vest. He said that Burns had cut small
               holes in it then grabbed the fabric and ripped it. Howell said
               he was wearing the vest when this happened. I returned inside
               to speak with Burns. I asked her if she would be truthful about
               what happened today. She just stared at me. I summarized for
               Burns what I think happened and she replied with "that's a nice
               little story". RP Jones then started speaking to Burns. She
               expressed to her that she is her friend and told her the
               relationship she was in with Howell is very unhealthy. I
               returned back outside where Howell was at. I confirmed with him
               that he did not strike Burns. He said no, and there was only
               one time where he pushed her back because she was "all up in my
               face". I asked if Burns hit him with both a closed fist and
               open hand slaps and he said yes. I confirmed with Howell that
               Burns ripped his vest during the argument and he said yes. I
               returned inside and told Burns she was under arrest for assault
               4th degree DV and for malicious mischief 3rd degree DV. She
               asked if she could put a bra on, and I escorted her to her
               bedroom where she changed. She was then placed in handcuffs,
               double locked, and advised that the incident was being
               audio/video recorded. Burns asked for her inhaler, which she
               told us she was prescribed. She said she takes the inhaler "as
               needed". I read her full miranda rights and Burns advised that
               she did not want to talk to me. I transported her to PPD and
               placed her in a holding cell. I confirmed with Burns that she
               did not need her inhaler at that moment and she said no. At
               about 1430 hours I was notified by PPD Reception that Burns was
               requesting her inhaler. Because it is a prescribed medication,
               medics were dispatched to the holding facility to administer
               the inhaler. While the medics were there Burns said the inhaler
               was for bronchitis but that she was experiencing anxiety. Burns
               used her inhaler but it did not help her breathing. She said
               the only thing that would help would be to call a friend. I
               allowed Burns to use her cell phone in the interview room to
               call a friend. After speaking for about 15 minutes with her
               friend, Burns appeared to have calmed down and felt better. I
               returned Burns' inhaler and cell phone to her property bin. She
               was later transported to Whitman County Jail. Charges forwarded
               for assault 4 DV and malicious mischief 3 DV. Case to be sent
               to student conduct and counseling services. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               11th day of November, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               of keys from laundry room at McEachern. Unable to contact
               complainant/victim. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On November 11, 2015 at about 1337 hours I was
               dispatched to the report of theft of keys from the laundry room
               at McEachern. I called the complainant as requested. I received
               a message stating that the number was no longer in service. I
               asked Whitcom to check their recordings to verify the number.
               Whitcom verified the number entered is what the complainant
               provided to them. I looked the number up in myWSU and verified
               that the number matches what the student provided. I went to
               the address provided, McEachern N429 to contact the complainant
               in person. A male answered the door. The name on the door was
               Ryder. He said he has lived in the same room all year long. He
               did not know of any Kristina's living near him. I was unable to
               make contact with the complainant. I can't verify what was
               taken or if anything was taken. No further investigation. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 11th day of November, 2015, in Pullman,

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5755 SYNOPSIS: Subject was significantly
               depressed and agreed to go to PRH. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 111115 at approximately 1600
               hours I came on duty and learned a Welfare Check was holding.
               Apparently, members of the Student Veterans Committee had
               called in concerned about another Veteran they had just met at
               the Coug. He had reportedly seemed despondent and depressed. He
               then stated something to the effect of "I give up" and left. I
               tried some of my contacts with the Committee and got a hold of
               Aaron Fisher, the President. He recounted what we already knew.
               I pressed for a last name and they were able to get me the name
               of John Henry. Is speaking with Fisher and Michael Salomon, I
               was able to identify John M. Henry (102389). I told them I
               would try and fill them in when I located him and had the
               chance. Ofc. Welter and I responded to McEachern E103. We got
               no response at the door so I tried his suite mate at 104 who
               knocked on the door from his side. We got no response. Ofc.
               Welter then radioed that Henry had arrived at his room. When I
               got there Henry seemed to be very emotional and was talking to
               Ofc. Welter. I interjected and told him why were there and that
               people were concerned about him. He felt we could not
               understand how bad he was hurting and I explained to him that I
               was a veteran as well. He offered to be put in handcuffs and
               that did not happen. He made no violent gestures or threats. He
               simply was deeply depressed. He agreed to go to the hospital. I
               had him change clothes before we went. He asked if someone
               could walk his dog, Gunner, so I said we could do it as we were
               not in a rush. He stated he could not wait to get help at PRH.
               I had Ofc. Welter come walk the dog while we went to PRH. We
               went to PRH and I remained with him for the duration. He had me
               speak with his mother, a Lorraine (253-576-0549). She was
               concerned he would kill himself. Henry's chief complaint was
               that he had no friends and felt alone. The MHP met with Henry
               and felt he was not a risk and had an appointment with a
               counselor already scheduled. She said that Henry had a firearm
               that was at his mother's house on the west side of the state. I
               provided Henry with a ride home. I provided him with my
               business card and told him I would check on him the following
               day. I cleared and went to the Coug to thank the Student
               Veterans Committee for calling. I cleared. Nothing follows. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 12th day of November, 2015, in Pullman,

               Conduct Selling Marijuana/False Statements NARRATIVE: On 11115
               at approximately 2058 hours I was dispatched to a Robbery that
               had reportedly just occurred on the 6th floor of Gannon. While
               en route I was told the RP, Emyly P. Hall (122495), was
               actually in the CUB waiting for me. I met Hall in the CUB. Hall
               explained to me that a white male with a brown mustache,
               standing approximately 5'6"-7", and wearing a t-shirt and jeans
               had ran up to her between Todd Hall and Wilson-Short Hall
               telling her the following: He and his friends had just been
               robbed at gunpoint on the 6th floor of Gannon Hall by 3 black
               males. His friends were involved with illegal activity and he
               did not want to involve Police. The suspects left in a car. The
               white male then left towards the Old Bookie. No other specifics
               were provided. As graveyard came on, I requested they get on
               foot between my position and Gannon Hall. Cpl. Daniels had gone
               to Gannon Hall and had some relating information. I met her at
               the 6 floor. She had been directed to room 603 as the room
               where the event occurred. Shortly after my arrival, Jonah S.
               McVay (100796), approached us in the hallway. McVay appeared
               out of breath and flushed. He said he lived in room 603. We
               stepped into the lounge and he recounted that he had 2
               playstation controllers for sale and 2 black males had come to
               his room to buy them. While they were looking at them they got
               up and ran out of the hall with the controllers. McVay and his
               friend, Tyler E. Overton (101795), chased after them but lost
               them shortly after. McVay had no idea who the males were. He
               said he had not advertised anywhere that he was selling the
               controllers. He described the two males as tall and skinny. One
               wore a North Face style puffy vest, black in color. The other
               male wore a red and black hoody. One of them wore a Supersonics
               beanie, black and green in color. He said the male in the red
               and black hoody took the controllers valued at $60. McVay said
               he had no idea who the males were but thought Overton did. He
               confirmed no gun had been involved and no threats were made.
               Cpl. Daniels cleared and McVay and I went to speak to Overton
               at 503 Goldsworthy. We found Overton and he agreed to speak
               with me in his room. It was evident by his bloodshot and watery

               eyes he had been smoking marijuana and admitted he had smoked
               about 15 minutes before the alleged incident. Overton's story
               matched McVay's only partially with noticeable details added
               and at first acted as if he was not sure why I was there. He
               told me that after one of the males had given him a fake $20
               bill was when they ran off with the controllers. He added that
               the males wore grey sweatpants and were visiting from Oakland
               for Dad's weekend. Overton claimed not to know the males but
               said they said their names were "J and Z". I told both McVay
               and Overton that there story was not adding up and someone was
               lying. I told them I could not help them if they were lying. I
               asked McVay about the money and he said he had forgotten about
               it. He did not know where it was. I asked if it might be still
               in his room and said it was possible. He agreed to let me go
               into his room to see if it was there. He and I walked back to
               Gannon and he allowed me to come in the room. He told me where
               everyone was standing. I pointed out the red controller that he
               had said was stolen and then I pointed out the black controller
               that he had said was stolen. He pointed out a black beanie on
               his roommate's bed that he thought belonged to one of the
               suspects. I told McVay he had one last chance to be honest with
               me. He then said the 2 males had come to buy marijuana. I read
               McVay his Miranda rights. He told me that they had come to buy
               a "dub" for $20. They provided fake money and then ran. He did
               not know who they were. McVay had me speak with his
               unidentified roommate to confirm the beanie was not his and I
               seized it. McVay and I walked back to speak with Overton. I
               spoke with Overton in the laundry room and I first read him his
               Miranda Rights. He confirmed what McVay told me but that the
               suspects were buying 16 grans for $160. He stood by his story
               that he did not know who they were. It seems the suspects were
               informed to knock on Overton's door, then they would go to
               McVay's to get the marijuana. Both denied having any more
               marijuana. Overton confirmed he had the money and he agreed to
               get it for me. He had given it to Michael John Aprahamian
               (052195). Aprahamian provided me with the counterfeit money. He
               was counseled for holding onto counterfeit money involved in
               drug transactions. Overton also confirmed no gun had been used.
               I informed McVay and Overton they would be referred to Student
               Conduct. I provided them with my business card in case they
               identified the suspects. I returned to the station and called
               Hall to inform her of the nature of the event and confirm that
               a gun had not been involved. The money, 8 fake $20 bills, and
               the beanie were later logged into evidence. I called Asst.
               Chief Hansen to inform him of what I had learned as Cpl.
               Daniels had called him early on regarding the gun. Case closed
               pending further developments. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 12th day of

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5764 SYNOPSIS: Subject was pulled over
               for speeding. He was under the age of 21 and had consumed

               Ian M. Ndambuki/07-12-95 Warned/Student Minor/DUI 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 11-10-15 at approximately 2325 hours I was on patrol heading
               eastbound on Olympia Ave, when I observed a red, 2014 Toyota
               Corolla (WA Lic. AXB1341) that appeared to be traveling above
               the posted 20 mph speed limit. I activated vehicle 41 radar in
               the moving mode and it emitted a loud and steady high pitched
               audio tone and displayed the Toyota's speed as 31 mph in a 20
               mph zone. My vehicle speed matched with the radar. I operated
               MPH Python III Directional Radar Serial #846003941, tuning fork
               number 283191 and 282809. Both tuning forks are certified. I
               checked the calibration of the SMD before my shift and it is in
               proper working order. I later checked the calibration of the
               SMD after my shift and it was still in proper working order. I
               turned around and activated my emergency lights. The vehicle
               came to a stop in the Olympia Hall parking lot. I contacted the
               driver of the vehicle who was later identified as Ian M.
               Ndambuki (DOB 07-12-95) by his WA driver's license. I told
               Ndambuki I was recording, and that the reason I pulled him over
               was for speeding. I asked for his driver's license, vehicle
               registration, and proof of insurance. He immediately handed me
               his driver's license, however I had to remind him about the
               vehicle registration and proof of insurance. He handed me his
               vehicle registration, and I asked him where he was coming from.
               Ndambuki told me he was coming from his house. He forgot to
               provide me with his proof of insurance so I had to remind him
               again. Ndambuki was unable to find it. I asked Ndambuki if he
               had anything to drink tonight, and he said no. I asked if I
               could check his eye's and he said "yeah sure". I checked his
               eye's for HGN while he sat in his vehicle. I observed lack of
               smooth pursuit in both of his eye's. I saw distinct and
               sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation in both his left and
               right eye. I could smell the odor of intoxicants coming from
               his breath. I again asked Ndambuki if he had anything to drink,
               and he said no. I asked him if he would be willing to take a
               voluntary preliminary breath test (PBT). I told him it does not
               replace the evidentiary breath test and is inadmissible in
               court. Ndambuki replied "Am I giving off the sense that I have
               been drinking?", and I told him yes. I told him because of the

               odor of intoxicants, his eye's, and my observations of his
               driving. As I was turning on the PBT, Ndambuki asked if he had
               to take it, and I told him it was voluntary. He provided me a
               breath sample of .032. I asked Ndambuki if he wanted to be a
               little bit more honest with me about drinking. He told me he
               drank about three hours ago. I asked him how much alcohol he
               drank, and he replied "like a shot". I told Ndambuki he should
               not drive his vehicle for the remainder of the night. Ofc.
               Westerman and Ofc. Whitman arrived on scene as backup officers.
               Ndambuki gave me permission to park his vehicle in a nearby
               parking spot. I explained to him I would be referring him to
               WSU Student Conduct, and he seemed to understand. Ndambuki was
               polite and cooperative throughout our encounter. No further
               action. My Vievu camera was activated, and the video was later
               downloaded into the permanent digital evidence folder. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 12th day of November, 2015, in Pullman,
