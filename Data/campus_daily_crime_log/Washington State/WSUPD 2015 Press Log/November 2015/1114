               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5805 11/14/15 SYNOPSIS: Female with
               mental health and/or medical issues transported by ambulance to
               Pullman Regional Hospital. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR#
               1. 2. NARRATIVE: On November 14, 2015 at about 1410 hours WSU
               Police and Pullman Fire were dispatched to Goldsworthy 525 for
               a female who was hallucinating and not acting correctly.
               Pullman Fire was dispatched to stage outside until the scene
               was safe. Officer Olmstead and I responded to the building. I
               was the first responder to arrive on scene. I contacted the
               patient, Leandra L. Choy-Thierman (12/05/96) in her room,
               Goldsworth 525. She did not appear to be acting normal. Her
               roommate was talking to her and hugging her to keep Choy-
               Thierman calm. Choy-Thierman had a plastic Dr. Who light in her
               hand. She seemed fixated on this toy. Choy-Thierman would
               answer questions correctly and was oriented. She would answer
               them in a child like voice. She did not seem to be present in
               the moment. Choy-Thierman said she took one (1) pill of her new
               anti depressant medication this morning. Since that time she
               has not been normal. She claims to have eaten a cup of yogurt
               with the medication. She said she vomited three (3) times since
               taking the medication. The medication was prescribed and filled
               yesterday. She said she took no drugs and/or alcohol. Pullman
               Fire personnel evaluated Choy-Thierman. During this time she
               broke down crying saying she can't go on anymore. I asked her
               if she tried or wanted to hurt herself. She said she just
               wanted to jump off the pedestrian bridge outside the residence
               hall and get run over by a car. She went on to tell me that she
               is a "cutter" and has most recently cut her arm in the past
               three (3) weeks. Choy-Thierman voluntarily went with Pullman
               Fire to Pullman Regional Hospital. Per RCW 71.05.150 I have
               reasonable cause to believe Choy-Thierman is suffering from a
               mental disorder and presents an imminent likelihood of serious
               harm to herself. I released Choy-Thierman to Pullman Regional
               Hospital for the purposes of determining treatment needs. I
               verified with PRH staff that WSU Counseling Services will be
               called to evaluate the patient because Choy-Thierman is a
               student. The signed protective custody form has been scanned to
               the case. No further investigation. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 14th day of
               November, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               111415 at approximately 1710 hours, I was dispatched to contact
               Swan Yoon regarding a theft. Upon contact, Yoon told me the
               following. On 091115 at approximately 1745 hours, he checked
               out a Bixi Green bike from a bike station near Flix Market. He
               rode the bike to the WSU SRC and at approximately 1900 hours,
               he locked it out front of the building using the bike lock
               provided from the rental. At approximately 2100 hours, he
               returned to the area where he locked the bike and it was gone.
               Yoon told me he has no idea who may have taken the bike and
               that he emailed the WSU Outdoor Recreation Center and
               determined the serial number on the bike was D02003. Yoon
               requested a report so he didn't have to be held responsible for
               the bike. I provided Yoon with the case number and cleared
               shortly after. I later emailed Ben Phaneuf with the ORC
               inquiring if the bike had been returned or not. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under

               NARRATIVE: On 11/15/15 at approximately 0038 hours I was
               driving southbound on B St approaching the intersection of
               Michigan St I noticed a male, later identified as William
               Thomas De Maris 04/27/97, standing on a retaining wall
               attempting to remove a no parking sign from the pole. A second
               male was standing on the sidewalk acting as a look out. The
               second male was later identified as Kenneth Stanley Day Jr
               03/10/97. I was driving an unmarked patrol car and was able to
               drive directly up to the two. I came to a stop and activated my
               emergency lights. I told the two to stop and De Maris jumped
               down off the retaining wall. I told De Maris that he was being
               detained and handcuffed him. I read De Maris his Miranda Rights
               and he stated he understood them. I could smell the strong odor
               of intoxicants coming from De Maris' breath. I asked De Maris
               for his ID and he let me take it out of his wallet. I asked Day
               for his ID and he provided his WADL. Both males were identified
               as 18 years old. I called for a Pullman Officer to respond due
               to the call happening in their jurisdiction. While talking with
               Day I could smell the strong odor of intoxicants coming from
               his breath. Ofc. Harris arrived on scene and stated he wished
               for me to warn both for the theft. I told Day and De Maris that
               they would be referred to student conduct and I was warning
               them for the attempted theft and MIP Exhibiting. I unhandcuffed
               De Maris and told both they needed to go home. Ofc. Harris was
               able to resecure the sign to the pole. Once back at the station
               I learned that Day had been arrested 15 days earlier for
               stealing a road sign. END OF REPORT I certify and declare under

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5821 SYNOPSIS: Officer saw male and
               female that appeared to be arguing outside of Vogel. Officers
               contacted subjects, and they said nothing was wrong. No assault
               appeared to have occurred. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR#
               1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 11-15-15 at approximately 0215 I was on
               patrol heading southbound on Stadium Way near Wilson Rd. when I
               saw a male and a female walking on the nearby sidewalk. It
               appeared as if the male and female were arguing. I saw the male
               push the female with his arm. I turned around and I contacted
               the two subjects out in front of Vogel, located at 1700 NE
               Wilson Rd. They were later identified as Michael A. Martinez
               (DOB 02-15-96) and Alexandra A. Tishkina (DOB 10-02-96). Both
               subjects appeared to be intoxicated. They both told me nothing
               was going on, and they did not know why I was contacting them.
               Ofc. Westerman arrived on scene as backup officer. I could see
               Martinez's right hand was very bloody as if he had punched
               something. Ofc. Westerman went and spoke with Martinez, while I
               spoke with Tishkina. Tishkina told me her and Martinez are
               "really good friends". When I asked if he pushed her, she said
               yeah but they were just playing with each other. Martinez had
               blood on her arms, that looked like it came from Martinez's
               injured hand. However, they were no apparent injuries on
               Tishkina. I asked her what happened to Martinez earlier, and
               she said he told her he had fallen down earlier. Tishkina kept
               telling me she was fine. Ofc. Westerman and I spoke, and we
               determined no assault occurred. I told Tishkina and Martinez
               they were both free to go. Ofc. Westerman requested medics to
               respond because Martinez was requesting someone look at his
               hand. Ofc. Westerman explained to him we were no longer
               detaining him, and he was free to leave at any time. Before
               medics arrived Martinez decided to leave the area. No further
               action. My Vievu camera was activated, and the video was later
               downloaded into the permanent digital evidence folder. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 15th day of November, 2015, in Pullman,

               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Samuel P. Reebs 12/30/91 Cited DUI C09970 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 11/15/15 at approximately 0250 hours I was
               traveling south on NE Stadium Way near Gannon Hall. I noticed
               two northbound vehicles. One of the vehicles caught my
               attention because it pulled into the lane closest to the curb
               and passed the other vehicle next to him and accelerated. I
               turned my vehicle around and caught up to the defendant's
               vehicle near Stadium and Wilson. As I passed Vogel Hall I
               stopped my patrol car (Veh 4) and activated my front radar. The
               radar displayed a speed reading of 28MPH in a 20MPH speed zone.
               As I was catching up to the vehicle I noticed it was very close
               to the curb and I saw the vehicle shake as if it hit the curb
               near Lower Dr. I activated my emergency lights, stopping the
               vehicle on Stadium Way and Lybecker. Ofc. Boyd arrived on scene
               at this time. I exited my vehicle and contacted the driver. I
               told the driver the stop was being recorded and the reason for
               the stop. I asked the driver for his license, registration, and
               proof of insurance, which he provided. The driver was
               identified by WADL as Samuel P. Reebs 12/30/91. While standing
               at the car I could smell the odor of intoxicants and marijuana
               emitting from the car. I could see a pipe in the center
               console. I asked Reebs how much he had to drink and he said 2
               beers. I asked Reebs if I could check his eyes and he said I
               could. I administered an HGN test with Reebs seated in the car.
               I could see Reebs eyes were bloodshot and watery and I saw a
               lack of smooth pursuit and a distinct and sustained nystagmus
               at maximum deviation in both eyes. I asked Reebs when he last
               smoked marijuana and he told me 10 hours prior. I asked how
               much marijuana was in the car. Reebs removed a small glass jar
               from the driver's door which contained about 1 1/2 grams of
               marijuana. Reebs also showed me the pipe from the console. I
               returned to my patrol car and ran Reebs' information through
               Whitcom with him returning clear and current. I turned off my
               front facing emergency lights. I returned to Reebs' vehicle and
               asked him if he would perform some field sobriety tests and he
               agreed. Reebs exited his vehicle and walked to the sidewalk on
               the west side of Lybecker. As Reebs exited his car and walked
               over I noticed he was unsteady on his feet and stumbled as he
               got to the sidewalk. I administered the field sobriety tests on
               the sidewalk on the northeast corner of Stadium Way and
               Lybecker St which was level and paved. Lighting was provided by

               overhead lights and my flashlight. The weather was clear with
               an approximate temperature of 50 degrees. Reebs was wearing
               jeans, a t-shirt, jacket, and black slip on shoes during the
               tests. I noticed Reebs zipper was undone. I explained to Reebs
               I would be evaluating him on how well he performed the tests
               and how well he followed my directions. I told Reebs not to
               start any test until I told him to do so. The first test I
               administered was the HGN. I told Reebs to stand with his feet
               together and his arms at his sides. I told Reebs to follow the
               tip of my pen with his eyes only with out moving his head. I
               held my pen approximately 12-15 inches in front of Reebs's face
               and administered the test. I checked Reebs' eyes and noticed
               they tracked equally with his pupils being equal in size. I did
               not see resting nystagmus in either eye. I saw a lack of smooth
               pursuit and a distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum
               deviation in both eyes. I saw an onset of nystagmus at
               approximately 40 degrees in both eyes. Reebs was swaying front
               to back during the test and moved his head several times. The
               next test I administered was the walk and turn. I told Reebs to
               find an imaginary straight line and put his left foot on the
               line. I told Reebs to put his right foot in front of his left
               foot touching heel to toe and leave his arms down at his sides.
               I told Reebs to stay in that position while I explained the
               test. I told Reebs that when I tell him to begin, to take nine
               steps touching heel to toe, watching his feet as he walked and
               count each step out loud. I told Reebs that when he gets to
               step nine, to leave his lead foot in place and using his rear
               foot, take small steps around until facing the way he came. I
               told Reebs to take nine steps back touching heel to toe and
               counting each step out loud. I told Reebs that once he started,
               do not stop. I reminded Reebs to count each step out loud, keep
               his arms at his sides, and watch his feet as he walked. I
               demonstrated the test and asked Reebs if he understood and he
               said yes. I told Reebs to begin at any time. Instruction Phase:
               Reebs attempted to start the test twice while I was explaining
               the starting position and I told him not to start yet. Reebs
               lost his balance twice during the instructions and had to step
               out of the starting position to regain his balance. First Nine
               Steps: Reebs began the test and missed heel to toe between
               steps 2 & 3, and 6 & 7. Reebs stepped off the line to the right
               on step 3 and off the line to the left on step 6. Reebs
               performed an improper turn by taking steps with both feet.
               Return Nine Steps: Reebs began the return steps and missed heel
               to toe between steps 3 & 4 and stepped off the line to the left
               on step 9. The next test I administered was the one leg stand.
               I told Reebs to stand with his feet together and his arms at
               his sides. I told Reebs that when I tell him to begin to raise
               the foot of his choice approximately 6 inches off the ground. I
               told Reebs to point his toe forward, look at his foot, and
               count out loud by 1000's until I tell him to stop. I asked
               Reebs if he understood, and he said yes. I told Reebs to begin
               at any time. Reebs raised his right foot off the ground and
               began the test. Reebs swayed left to right during the test and
               raised his arms for balance on his counts of 1011, 1014, and
               1019. Reebs put his foot down on his counts of 1014 and 1021.

               Thirty seconds elapsed on Reebs count of 1021. The next test I
               administered was the PBT. I told Reebs the PBT did not replace
               the evidentiary breath test and it was voluntary. I asked Reebs
               if he would submit to a PBT and he said yes. I checked the PBT
               (FST # 5493) and found it in proper working condition. I asked
               Reebs if he knew the legal limit in the State of Washington for
               DUI and he said a .08. I asked Reebs if he had to guess where
               he thought he would be. Reebs said a .06. Reebs gave a breath
               sample of .168 at 0307 hours. At this time it was my opinion
               that Reebs's ability to drive was impaired by alcohol. I told
               Reebs he was under arrest for DUI. I handcuffed (D/L) Reebs and
               advised him of his right to counsel and reminded him he was
               being audio and video recorded. I searched Reebs incident to
               arrest, finding no weapons or items of evidence. I placed Reebs
               in the back seat of my patrol car. Ofc. Boyd facilitated the
               tow/impound with Myers towing. I transported Reebs to Pullman
               PD for the BAC. Upon arrival I checked the Draeger and found it
               in proper working condition with the mouth tube warm to the
               touch. I checked Reebs mouth at 0325 hours, finding no foreign
               substance. I read Reebs his Constitutional Rights at 0327
               hours. Reebs said he understood his rights and signed both
               signature blocks. I read Reebs his Implied Consent Warning for
               Breath at 0330 hours. Reebs signed that it was read to him. I
               asked Reebs if he would submit to a breath test. Reebs checked
               the "yes" box and initialed next to it. I asked Reebs if he
               understood his Implied Consent and he said yes. Reebs provided
               a breath sample of .178 IR / .177 EC at 0345 hours and a sample
               of .181 IR / .178 EC at 0348 hours. The breath test was
               administered in accordance to the methods approved by the
               Washington State Toxicologist pursuant to the Washington
               Administrative Code. I provided Reebs with a copy of the
               following documents: Driver's Hearing Request, Notice to
               Appear/Conditions of Release, the Tow/Impound Form, and the
               Breath Test Document. I issued Reebs a criminal citation for
               DUI. I explained the citation to Reebs and provided him a copy.
               I released Reebs from custody. Reebs was extremely polite and
               cooperative during the process and appeared genuinely
               remorseful. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 15th day of November, 2015, in
               Pullman, Washington. _______________________________________

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5824 SYNOPSIS: Hall staff concerned
               about a female who locked herself in a bathroom who may have
               passed out. Female was contacted and determined to be fine.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Victoria C. Matio
               01/31/97 2. NARRATIVE: On 11/15/15 at approximately 0331 hours
               I was called to room 315 in Global Scholars Hall for a welfare
               check. The RED on duty was calling that an intoxicated female
               had locked herself in a bathroom and may have passed out. Upon
               arrival I spoke with one of the people who lives in room 315
               who told me their friend had used the bathroom and locked the
               door. After several minutes they went to check on her and she
               would not respond. I was able to open the bathroom door with
               the lock release button on the door. Inside the bathroom I
               found Victoria C. Matio 01/31/97 who was sleeping on the
               bathroom floor. I was able to get Victoria to wake up and talk
               to me. I asked Victoria a series of questions to determine her
               mental status. Victoria was able to answer all of the
               correctly. Victoria stated she was visiting WSU and is not a
               student. I had Victoria return to her air mattress and asked if
               there was anything else I could do. Everybody in the room said
               they were fine now. I left the room and cleared the call. END
               OF REPORT I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 15th day of November, 2015, in Pullman,
