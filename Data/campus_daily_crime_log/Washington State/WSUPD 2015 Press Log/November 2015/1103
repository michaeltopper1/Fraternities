    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: JAK/333 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5543 SYNOPSIS: I responded to the 2nd
               floor of the Fine Arts parking structure and met WSU Parking
               and Transportation Services regarding a fake parking permit
               inside of a parked vehicle. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 11-03-15, I responded to the
               2nd floor of the WSU Fine Arts parking structure and met WSU
               Parking and Transportation Services employee Antonio Barragan.
               Barragan told me he discovered a fake WSU parking permit inside
               WA/AOT8412. I looked at the front windshield of the car and saw
               an Orange 1 (OR1 5466) taped to the windshield. He said he knew
               the permit was fake due to the bar code and coloring of the
               permit. Barragan had placed a wheel lock boot on the driver's
               side front wheel of the car and a ticket under the windshield
               wiper of the car. Barragan said the current value of an Orange
               1 parking permit is $546.00. He said he had spoken with his
               boss and as long as the vehicle owner was cooperating and paid
               all of her parking fines, WSU Parking and Transportation
               services did not want to press criminal charges. They did want
               to fake parking permit as a training aid. I told him I would
               work on finding the vehicle owner and cleared. A short time
               later, I received a phone call from WSU Parking and
               Transportation Services stating they believed they located a
               class schedule for the owner of the vehicle. They said the
               student name was Yinan Zhou (06-01-92) and said she was in a
               class in the Fine Arts building until 1140 hours. As it was
               nearly 1130, I decided to wait near the vehicle. A short time
               later, an Asian female; later identified as Yinan Zhou (06-01-
               92), arrived at the vehicle. I contacted Zhou and asked her if
               she knew why I was there. She said she did not. I told her I
               was there because of the fake parking permit inside of her
               vehicle. She said she made the copy of her original parking
               permit because her friend needed a permit and she could not
               afford it. I asked her if she would be willing to give me the
               fake permit from her vehicle so I could take it back to WSU
               Parking and Transportation Services. She gave me the permit and
               I took it to Parking and Transportation Services. WSU Parking
               and Transportation Services was going to handle the situation
               going forward. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 3rd day of November, 2015, in

               extra patrol at Community/Duncan Dunn after an assault occurred
               earlier in the morning. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               2. NARRATIVE: On 11--03-15 at about 1212 hours Officer Kirshner
               and I conducted an extra patrol at Community/Duncan Dunn. About
               10 minutes prior to the extra patrol I had talked with the very
               upset father of Natalie Vance. He said that Justin was back in
               the dorms and was wondering why he wasn't kicked out after
               having a deadly weapon. He said that Justin has been running up
               and down the halls banging on doors. I attempted to explain the
               situation to Mr. Vance but he continually interrupted and said
               that we are not keeping his daughter safe and that we don't
               care what she has to say. I tried to tell Mr. Vance that is not
               true, but he did not want to hear what I had to say. He
               instructed me to call his daughter to see if she is safe then
               hung up on me. Kirshner and I then went to Community Duncan
               Dunn. We walked through the hall 3 times from top to bottom. We
               knocked on Justin's door but he was not home. A nearby resident
               said that he had seen him about one hour ago but had nothing
               significant to say about their interaction. I then knocked on
               Natalie's door. Her roommate opened the door and said she was
               not home and that she had not seen her all morning. I returned
               to WSUPD to call Natalie. I asked her what happened this
               morning, after the initial call that was investigated. She said
               nothing has happened, and that she has not seen Justin since
               the incident early this morning. She told me she has been at
               class from 9-12. She then told me that she received a text
               message from another resident that told her Justin knocked on
               the shower door and said "identify yourself". The resident gave
               a fake name, and Justin replied "oh, I was looking for someone
               else". Natalie said this is all she knows about anything
               happening after our contact earlier this morning. Natalie then
               went on to say that she never meant for anybody to get into
               trouble and she does not want to see anybody kicked out of the
               dorms. She said "I wouldn't mind him staying" and that "I feel
               safe in the dorm". I asked Natalie if she feels threatened by
               Justin and she said "no". She elaborated and said that "I don't
               feel like my life is threatened". She told me several times she
               feels safe in her dorm, but added that it makes her "a little
               uneasy" when Justin is around. She said that she is just going
               to carry her pepper spray around with her at all times. I then
               spoke with Natalie about the importance of her and all of her
               friends calling 911 when something is happening that they feel

               impossible for the police department to do anything about a
               problem if we do not know about it. Natalie seemed hesitant to
               agree. I asked Natalie if there was anything else I could do
               for her right now and she said no. I ended my call with her.

               was dispatched to the report of a vehicle prowl. Whitcom
               advised that a parking permit was stolen from a vehicle parked
               in the Red 2 lot behind the Air Supported Structure. I
               responded to the area and contacted Marc Clark. Clark told me
               that he parked his car around 7am. He was not sure if it was
               locked. He said when he returned around 1pm he noticed his
               parking permit had been stolen. He said that there was no
               damage to his car and that nothing else was taken. Clark
               provided a permit number of RD2 25348. He said that Parking
               Services had already been notified. I gave Clark my business
               card with the case number. I told him that if he locates his
               stolen permit to return it to Parking Services and not to use
               it. He stated he understood. The permit is currently valued at
               $190.00. No suspects or leads. I certify and declare under

               at approximately 1623 hours, I was dispatched to a report of a
               hit and run collision that occurred on 102615. Dispatch advised
               Courtney Rucker wanted phone contact regarding the incident.
               Upon contact, Rucker told me the following. On 102615 at
               approximately 0900 hours, she parked her car in the CUE parking
               garage and went to class. At approximately 1000 hours, she
               returned to her car and noticed the rear tail light of her 2009
               Toyota Camry had been cracked and there was a black paint
               transfer mark just below the tail light on the rear bumper. I
               asked Courtney if she had any idea who may have caused the
               damage to her car and she told me she didn't. I asked Courtney
               to email me a picture of the damage and she did. I looked at
               the picture she emailed me and estimated the damage at
               approximately $400.00. I attached the picture to the case. Case
               inactive pending further leads. I certify and declare under

               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Julian C. Lester/082182 Protective Custody 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 11/03/15 at about 2131 hours Whitman County
               Sheriffs Office was dispatched to a suicidal subject at 2201
               Whelan Rd. The subject had a knife and was threatening to kill
               himself. WCSO requested an agency assist from WSU Police
               Department. Corporal Daniels, Officer Boyd and I responded. We
               arrived on scene and could see the subject, Julian C. Lester,
               through the window of the house. Lester had a knife in his hand
               and was arguing with someone else in the house. We took up a
               position to observe Lester through the window. Officer Boyd had
               a shotgun with less lethal rounds, I had a taser readied and
               Corporal Daniels had lethal cover. I could see Lester moving
               inside the house and at one point saw him stab the knife he was
               holding into what appeared to be a counter top. WCSO units
               arrived and attempted to contact Lester using their vehicle PA
               system. Lester eventually exited the house with his hands up,
               he walked towards and was not listening to verbal commands. He
               finally stopped walking and then began to listen to verbal
               commands. Lester turned around and went down to his knees and
               then onto his belly with his arms out. I approached while other
               officers maintained cover. I secured Lester's right wrist with
               a straight wrist twist lock and handcuffed(DL) him. Lester
               informed me he was bleeding from his hands. I searched Lester
               and found a box knife in his back pocket. I informed Lester he
               was being audio and video recorded. Lester continually asked
               not to be hurt. Officer Boyd said his behavior tonight almost
               resulted in him being shot with a bean bag round, Lester
               commented "I should have capped your ass before you even came
               down the lot". I placed him in the back of Deputy Nebe's
               vehicle and informed him of his rights. He said he understood
               them. I took Lester back out of the vehicle and Deputy
               Pelissier informed him he was in protective custody and would
               be transported to the hospital. Fire District 12 ambulance crew
               was on scene and evaluated Lester injuries. Lester's knuckles
               on his right hand had several avulsions with blood around them
               that had begun to dry. He also had cuts and dried blood on the
               left side of his neck. I walked Lester to Officer Boyd's
               vehicle and he was transported to Pullman Regional Hospital.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
