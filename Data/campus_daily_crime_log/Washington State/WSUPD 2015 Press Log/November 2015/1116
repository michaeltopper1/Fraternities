    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Edwards/330 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5837 SYNOPSIS: Report of an attempted
               theft of a library book. Investigation continues. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Macy D. Milnes Attempted Theft
               3rd 2. NARRATIVE: On 11-16-15 at about 0742 hours I was
               dispatched to the report of an attempted theft that occurred on
               11-15-15 from Holland Library. The RP, Sue Shipman, was
               requesting phone contact. I called Shipman who told me the
               following; she said that last night a student by the name of
               Macy D. Milnes, attempted to steal a library book by removing
               the bar code and date due slip from the book. Milnes tried
               exiting the library through the front gate but was
               "apprehended" by library employee Tess Prow. Shipman did not
               have any other information. She provided a phone number and
               work schedule for Prow so I could contact her. At about 0810
               hours I attempted contact with Milnes. I called her cell phone,
               she did not answer. I left her a voicemail message asking her
               to return my call. I will call Prow after 1400 hours when she
               arrives at work. At about 0954 hours Milnes returned my call
               and left me a voicemail message. I was able to return her call
               at 1330 hours. I asked her to explain to me what happened last
               night. She told me the following; she told me that she was at
               the library doing "study tables" with friends. Milnes said that
               she had several personal books, textbooks, notebooks and other
               school work all together with this library book (the Quaran).
               She said she was packing up and had all of her stuff in a pile.
               She said the Quaran was in this pile, and she unintentionally
               put the Quaran in her backpack with the rest of her books.
               Milnes told me that she did not realize she had done this until
               the alarm when off at the front doors. She said the librarian
               contacted her and she tried to check the book out. Milnes said
               that the librarian told her she could not check it out because
               there was no barcode. Milnes said she left the library and was
               surprised to get a call from me this morning. Milnes told me
               that she had no intentions of taking the book, especially since
               she can check it out for free. Milnes was forthcoming with
               information. It did not sound like she was being dishonest with
               me. I will attempt contact with Prow after 1400 hours. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this ____ day of _____________, 2015, in

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5845 SYNOPSIS: Hall staff reported the
               odor of marijuana emitting from within Rogers Hall, room 825. 4
               subjects were contacted, warned, and will be forwarded to the
               WSU Office of Student Standards and Accountability. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 11-16-15, the
               Residential Educational Director for Rogers Hall; Ross A.
               McClure (12-30-86), called Whitcom regarding the odor of
               marijuana emitting from within Rogers Hall, room 825. I
               contacted McClure and asked him to rate how sure he was the
               odor he was smelling from room 825 was marijuana. I asked him
               to use a scale from 1 to 10 with 1 being the lowest and 10
               being the highest. He said he would rate the odor at a 5. Based
               on the information McClure provided I did not apply for a
               Search Warrant. Officer Olmstead and I responded to the 8th
               floor of Rogers Hall. As I exited the elevator, I immediately
               smelled something which smelled like marijuana, but mixed with
               something I was not familiar with. I decided to knock on the
               door to room 825 to investigate further. As I approached the
               door, it opened, and a male; later identified as Colin D.
               Clinch (12-15-96), began walking out of the room wearing a
               towel and carrying a "Shower Caddy". I asked him if anyone else
               was in the room and he said "Yes". I asked him if he could open
               the door and have everyone come out of the room. He opened the
               door and a male and female exited the room. Officer Olmstead
               asked the male who had just exited the room if anyone else was
               in the room and he said "Yes". Officer Olmstead told the male
               to "Get them out here". A female exited the room. I asked
               everyone to go to the study lounge so we could talk. Once we
               were all in the study lounge I asked who the residents of room
               825 were. Mankowski and Clinch said they were. I asked if they
               knew why Officer Olmstead and I were there. Clinch stayed quiet
               and Mankowski said he did not know. I told him we were there
               due to the odor of marijuana emitting from within his room. He
               said he didn't know what I was talking about because he didn't
               have any marijuana in his room and did not smoke any marijuana
               in his room. He said he has smoked marijuana in the past, but
               did not smoke or keep any in his room. I identified the females
               who had been in room 825 when we arrived as Maricela B. Nunez
               (04-22-97) and Daria R. Winterer (11-17-96). I asked Nunez to
               come speak with me in the hallway. I asked her if she had ever
               had contact with Law Enforcement. She said she has been sent to
               Student Conduct due to a contact involving marijuana. I told
               her it was probably in her best interest to be honest with me

               since she has already had contact with Student Conduct due to a
               similar issue. She said the only person who smoked marijuana
               was Mankowski. She said he smoked it in his room. I gathered
               her contact information and told her she was free to go. I
               asked to speak with Winterer in the hallway. She said she had
               entered room 825 just prior to our arrival. She said she had
               entered the room to give them an update on a friend who had
               fallen off of a balcony. She said she was unaware if anyone had
               smoked marijuana. I gathered her contact information and told
               her she was free to go. I asked Clinch to speak with me in the
               hallway. He said he had been in his room for approximately 30
               minutes prior to our arrival. He said he was unaware if anyone
               smoked marijuana and said no one did while he was in the room.
               I gathered his contact information and told him he was free to
               go. I entered the study lounge area and read Mankowski his
               Miranda Rights, which he stated he understood. He agreed to
               speak with me. I asked him about the odor emitting from within
               his room and he told me there were a lot of people on the floor
               who smoke marijuana. He said the wind circulates in a strange
               manner and it could have been coming from a different room.
               Officer Olmstead asked why the odor became overpoweringly
               strong when the door to his room was opened. Mankowski said
               something to the effect of "I don't know because I don't have
               any marijuana in my room". I asked him if he smoked marijuana
               in his room and he said he did not. I asked him why someone
               would have told me he did and he said "I doubt someone would
               have said that". I told him someone did tell me that. He again
               said something to the effect of "I don't know because I don't
               have any marijuana in my room". I asked him if he would allow
               us to search his room to ensure he was telling the truth and he
               said he did not want us searching his room. I told him I would
               be typing a Police Report regarding the contact and would be
               forwarding it to the WSU Office of Student Standards and
               Accountability. He said he understood. I told him he was free

               extortion via text message. Investigation continues. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 11-16-15 at
               about 1355 hours I was dispatched to the report of harassment.
               Whitcom advised that the RP, Melody S. Wakeling, was in the
               WSUPD lobby. I contacted Wakeling in the lobby and escorted her
               to the interview room. I asked Wakeling to explain what was
               going on. She told me the following; she said that today around
               12:13 she received a text message from an unknown person saying
               they had nude photos of her and wanted to "make a deal".
               Wakeling showed me her cell phone and the text conversation she
               had with an unknown person. The text reads as follows: 952-222-
               6049: Hey is this Melody? Melody: Yes, who is this? 952-222-
               6049: A friend of yours sent me something of you Melody: A
               friend? 952-222-6049: Yeah Melody: Who is this mutual friend?
               And could you be a bit less cryptic? 952-222-6049: I have nudes
               of you Melody: Mmhmmmm, from Minnesota? 952-222-6049: Fake
               number Melody: Mmhmmmm. Right. Does this conversation have a
               point? 952-222-6049: Yes I want to make a deal Melody: A deal
               952-222-6049: Yes Melody: With what 952-222-6049: You and your
               pics ***end of conversation. Melody is not respond and came to
               the police department at this point*** I asked Wakeling if she
               has ever taken nude photos and she said yes. Wakeling then
               explained to me that when she was 14 years old, living in
               Spokane Valley, Washington, she took several nude photos of
               herself and emailed them to her boyfriend at the time. She said
               her boyfriend was also 14 years old. She described the photos
               as one that was taken in a mirror, showing her entire nude body
               and the others were pointing down, towards her naked body. She
               told me that she dated this boyfriend (Austin Harper) for 2.5
               years and that she does not know what he did with the photos
               when they broke up. I asked Wakeling if she thinks Harper has
               anything to do with this. She said she didn't think so, but he
               is the only person with nude photos of her. She said that while
               she dated Harper he was verbally abusive and used "verbal
               manipulation" to get her to do things sexually to him that she
               did not want to do. Wakeling said that nothing was never
               physical abuse and that she was never assaulted. She said that
               he would "beg" her to do "things". She said that she did not
               want to do the things he was asking but would eventually give
               in, even though it made her cry. Wakeling did not want to talk
               about anything specific and said that she has already been to
               therapy and has "come to terms" with what happened during her

               relationship with Harper. Wakeling told me that she no longer
               has contact with Harper. She said she blocked his phone number
               and Facebook account. She told me that he attempted to contact
               her on October 7th via text message but she did not respond.
               She provided his phone number of 509-929-8666. After my contact
               with Wakeling I attempted to find more information about whose
               phone number was used as well as Austin Harper. It was
               determined that the cell phone provider for the phone number
               952-222-6049 is a company called "Bandwidth". I found that
               "Bandwidth" offers many telephone services and they offer to
               verify "target phone numbers" without a legal process. I
               emailed Bandwidth at legal@bandwidth.com, asking them to verify
               if the phone number 952-222-6049 belongs to a customer of
               theirs. I am waiting for their response. I also searched
               Facebook and found a profile belonging to "Austin Harper" from
               Spokane Valley. His profile states that he currently lives in
               Bainbridge Island, Washington. I called Wakeling back to ask a
               couple clarifying questions on information I found on this
               page. I believe this is the same Austin Harper that Wakeling
               dated. While looking through this Facebook page I saw that in
               June 2013 Harper traveled to Minneapolis, Minnesota. I could
               not find anything associated with his visit, or who he may have
               been with. I looked through his "friends list" but could not
               identify anybody with the phone number in question or that
               lives in Minnesota. Investigation continues. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               ____ day of _____________, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.
