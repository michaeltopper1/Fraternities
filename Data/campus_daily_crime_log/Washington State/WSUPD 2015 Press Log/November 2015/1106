               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5616 11/06/15 SYNOPSIS: Theft of a
               battery in a UPS battery back up at Todd Addition 279AT.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               November 6, 2015 at about 1030 hours I was dispatched to a
               theft at Todd Addition 279AT. I contacted the complainant,
               Damon Estes, by telephone. Estes works for WSU Information
               Technology. He told me that someone took the battery out of a
               UPS (Unintterruptible Power Supply) in Todd Addition 279AT on
               November 5, 2015 at exactly 0842:38. He said this is a
               mechanical room accessed by an M1000 key. There were two UPS's
               in the room. Only one of the units was disturbed. Estes said it
               is unknown why someone would only take the battery and not the
               entire UPS. He said there was nothing wrong with the battery as
               it passed a self test on November 3, 2015. The battery weighs
               about 60 pounds and is 2 feet long by 1 foot wide by 8 inches
               tall. The color and identifying number or markings are unknown.
               Estes was told by his supervisor to report the theft. The
               battery is valued at $460.00. I called WSU Facilities
               Operations to inquire if they had any work in that room or if
               their personnel removed the battery. They had no record or
               knowledge of work being done in this room. There are no
               suspect, witnesses, or leads at this time. No further
               investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 6th day of November, 2015, in
               Pullman, Washington. _______________________________________

               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 11-06-
               2015 at about 1110 hrs I was dispatched to a welfare check at
               Streit Hall, located at 1620 NE Cougar Way. I arrived on scene
               and contacted the complainant, Konrad J. Borden (DOB 07-24-
               1996), in the Streit Hall lobby. Borden said he was concerned
               about his friend, identified as Amber N. Ehli (DOB 11-25-1996).
               Ehli resides at Streit Hall #535. Borden said on 11-06-2015 at
               about 0000 hrs he had a text message conversation with Ehli,
               and she seemed depressed. Borden said Ehli made statements
               like, "please don't hate me" and "please forgive me". Borden
               said Ehli did not show up for class this morning and has not
               been answering his telephone calls today. Borden requested a
               welfare check on Ehli. I contacted Ehli in her residence hall
               room. I asked Ehli about the text messages and if she wanted to
               harm herself. Ehli told me she did not want to hurt herself.
               Ehli explained that she was drunk last night, and her text
               messages were misunderstood. Ehli told me her text messages
               were referring to her alcohol consumption and were not suicidal
               in nature. After speaking with Ehli, I determined that she was
               fine and did not appear to be depressed or suicidal. Ehli
               decided to speak with Borden, who was waiting in the lobby. I
               cleared the scene. No further action at this time. Olmstead/339
               I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws

               at about 0200 hours. She was trying to sleep and did not answer
               the phone. Ros said she just texted her family a few minutes
               ago. She said she will call her father. She is well. I called
               her father back to let him know she is well and that I had made

               was another male in the room. I told them why I was knocking on

               Kaneisha N. Butts 09/15/95 Student Conduct Poss. of Marijuana
               2. NARRATIVE: On 11/06/15 at approximately 2140 hours I was
               driving westbound on Stadium Way approaching a red light at
               East Main Street. When I came to a stop I noticed the car in
               front of me, WA/ALJ1566, did not have a working center high
               mounted brake light. As the light turned green the vehicle
               turned left onto East Main without signaling their turn. I
               initiated a traffic stop and the vehicle pulled into Sella's
               parking lot. While walking up the the car I noticed I had
               forgot my body camera at the station. I contacted the driver,
               Kaneisha Nicole Butts 09/15/95, identified myself, and
               explained the reason for the traffic stop. Butts stated she
               just had the light replaced. I asked for Butts driver's license
               and she stated she did not have it with her. Butts provided me
               with her WSU Cougar Card. I wrote the rest of Butts'
               information down. Butts also did not have a proof of insurance.
               While talking with Butts, Intern Peters who was standing on the
               passenger side of the car, told me he could see a glass pipe on
               the passenger floorboard. Intern Petters stated the pipe had
               been in the glove box and was pulled out by the passenger while
               they were looking for the vehicle registration. I asked Butts
               about the pipe and she said it was not hers rather it was a
               friend who left it in her car. I asked Butts if I could see the
               pipe and Butts handed it to me. The glass pipe smelled strongly
               of burnt marijuana I could see burnt pieces of marijuana in the
               bowl. I asked Butts and her passenger if they were over 21
               years old or possessed medical marijuana cards. Both said no to
               both questions. I asked Butts for consent to search the car but
               she refused. I returned to my patrol car and had Ofc. Tiengo
               respond with my body camera. Once Ofc. Tiengo arrived on scene
               he handed me my body camera and I began recording. I filled out
               Sector NOIs for no proof of insurance, no license on person,
               and possessing marijuana in a vehicle. I returned to Butts and
               explained the citations. I provided Butts with her copy of the
               citations and verbally warned her for not signaling her turn
               and the defective brake light. I also told Butts that she would
               be referred to student conduct due to the illegal item. Butts
               was told she was free to go and I cleared. The seized pipe was
               photographed and logged into evidence marked for destruction.

    Narrative: RVWD:MTK/336 OFC: DBT/321 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5638 SYNOPSIS: Subject was stopped for
               speeding on Stadium Way near Nevada St. He was arrested for
               minor operating a motor vehicle after consuming alcohol.
               Subject was cited and released. He will be referred to WSU
               Student Conduct. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Jacob
               E. Deruwe/09-20-96 Cited and Released Minor DUI 10154 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 11-07-15 at approximately 0028 hours I was on
               patrol heading northbound on Stadium Way, when I observed a
               blue, 2015 Ram 2500 (WA Lic. C84152D) that appeared to be
               traveling above the posted 20 mph speed limit traveling
               southbound on Stadium Way. I activated vehicle 41 radar in the
               moving mode and it emitted a loud and increasing high pitched
               audio tone and displayed the truck's speed as 29 mph in a 20
               mph zone. My vehicle speed matched with the radar. I operated
               MPH Python III Directional Radar Serial #846003941, tuning fork
               number 283191 and 282809. Both tuning forks are certified. I
               checked the calibration of the SMD before my shift and it is in
               proper working order. I later checked the calibration of the
               SMD after my shift and it was still in proper working order. I
               turned around and activated my emergency lights. The vehicle
               came to a stop on Nevada St. near Stadium Way, in front of the
               Stephenson Complex. I contacted the driver of the vehicle, who
               was later identified as Jacob E. Deruwe (DOB 09-20-96). I
               advised him I was audio and video recording. I told Deruwe the
               reason for the traffic stop was because he was traveling 29 mph
               in a 20 mph zone. I asked Deruwe for his driver's license,
               vehicle registration, and proof of insurance. I asked him where
               he was coming from, and he said just from my parking lot in
               grey 1. Deruwe asked me if the speed limit was 25 mph after I
               had just told him it was 20 mph. He handed me his driver's
               license, but I had to remind him about the vehicle registration
               and proof of insurance. I could smell the odor of intoxicants
               coming from his truck, and his eyes were watery and bloodshot.
               Deruwe handed me his vehicle registration, but I had to ask
               again for his proof of insurance. He finally handed me his
               insurance card, but it had expired in July of 2015. Deruwe told
               me that was only insurance card he had. I asked Deruwe if he
               had anything to drink tonight, and he said no. I asked if I may
               check his eyes, and he said "yeah". I checked his eyes for lack
               of smooth pursuit, and I saw it in both of his eyes. I then
               checked for distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum
               deviation, and I saw it in both his left and right eye. I asked
               if he would be willing to take some voluntary field sobriety

               tests because he told me he has had nothing to drink, but I
               could tell he has been drinking. Deruwe then said "well I was
               around alcohol a couple hours ago". I asked him to step out of
               his vehicle, and he did. I reminded him I was audio and video
               recording. I asked him how old he was, and he said 19. I again
               asked him about the alcohol, and he told me he had a "little
               bit" a couple of hours ago. Deruwe told me he thinks he had
               half a beer out of a red solo cup. He then told me he had one
               full cup. I could smell the medium odor of intoxicants coming
               from his breath. I asked him if he would be willing to take
               some voluntary field sobriety tests again. Deruwe told me he
               did not really want to, but asked if he needed too. I told him
               it was a yes or no question. He then finally said he did not
               want to take them. I asked if he would take a voluntary
               preliminary breath test, and he replied I will take those
               walking tests. I again asked him if he would take the fields,
               and he said yes. Ofc. Westerman soon arrived on scene as backup
               officer. I administered the field sobriety tests to Deruwe. He
               took a preliminary breath test (PBT) at about 0042 hours and
               provided a sample of .060. I told Deruwe he was under arrest
               for Minor Operating a Motor Vehicle After Consuming Alcohol. I
               handcuffed Deruwe (double locked) and searched him incident to
               arrest, finding no items of evidentiary value or weapons.
               Deruwe gave Ofc. Westerman permission to park his truck for him
               in a nearby parking lot. I placed him in the back of my patrol
               vehicle. I read him his Constitutional Rights from my
               department issued Miranda Warning card. I asked if he
               understood his rights, and he said "yes". I asked if he would
               be willing to speak with me now, and he said "sure, you have
               any questions?". I again asked Deruwe how much he had to drink
               tonight, and he said "I might have had two". I began
               transporting Deruwe to Pullman Police Department for the breath
               test. Once we arrived at Pullman Police Department, I searched
               Deruwe one more time. I asked him if he wanted to speak with an
               attorney, and he said no. I read Deruwe his Constitutional
               Rights at about 0058 hours. Deruwe said he understood his
               rights and signed both signature blocks. I checked Deruwe's
               mouth at 0103 hours, finding no foreign substance. He told me
               he had to use the restroom, so I let him. Once Deruwe returned
               from the restroom I rechecked his mouth at about 0105 hours,
               finding no foreign substance. I read Deruwe his Implied Consent
               Warning for Breath at 0102 hours. Deruwe signed that it was
               read to him. I asked Deruwe if he would submit to a breath
               test, and he said yes. He checked the yes box and initialed
               next to it. Deruwe provided a breath sample of .054 (IR) / .055
               (EC) at 0129 hours and a sample of .054 (IR) / .054 (EC) at
               0132 hours. The breath test was administered in accordance to
               the methods approved by the Washington State Toxicologist
               pursuant to the Washington Administrative Code. Deruwe was
               fingerprinted and photographed. I issued Deruwe criminal
               citation #10154 for Minor Operating a Motor Vehicle after
               Consuming Alcohol. I provided him with a copy of the driver's
               hearing request, and explained it to him. I provided him with
               his criminal citation. I provided him with his notice of
               hearing/conditions of release and explained it to him. I

               explained all the forms to Deruwe, and returned all of his
               property to him. I provided Deruwe a courtesy transport back to
               his dorm at Scott Hall. I later downloaded the video footage
               from my Vievu camera to the permanent digital evidence folder.
               I later faxed the DUI report to the Washington Department of
               Licensing. Deruwe was polite and cooperative throughout our
               encounter. No further action at this time. I certify and

               female entered her dorm room in Streit Hall and urinated. The
               investigation continues. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR#
               1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 11-07-15 at approximately 0236 hours I was
               dispatched to the report of a trespassing at Streit Hall room
               #331, located at 1620 NE Cougar Way. Dispatch advised the
               suspect had left about ten minutes ago, and subjects were
               unsure who she was. Dispatch said the female had walked into
               the subjects room and urinated. Suspect was about 5' 2" in
               height, wearing a green jacket, denim jeans, boots, and had
               long brown hair with highlights. Last seen walking towards the
               north side stairwell. Ofc. Kirshner and I arrived on scene. I
               contacted three females later identified as Xy'lah K. Brandes
               (DOB 03-19-97), Ashley J. Armstrong (DOB 10-09-97), and Shakita
               K. Samuels (DOB 07-01-97). Brandes and Armstrong both live in
               room #331, and their friend Samuels lives down the hallway in
               room #316. There were also a few Resident Advisors that were in
               room #331. I asked Brandes what happened. Brandes told me she
               was asleep in her bed, when she heard someone in her room and
               woke up. She said she saw a female sitting on the ground next
               to her bed. Brandes asked the female repeatedly what she was
               doing in her room, and the female kept repeating the names
               "Payton", "Veronica", and "Makayla". Brandes described the
               female has having slurred speech, blood shot, and watery eyes.
               I asked Brandes what the female looked like and she described
               her as being about 5' 2" in height, wearing a green jacket,
               denim jeans, boots, and had long brown hair with highlights.
               They described the female as having "colored eyes". When I
               asked them what they meant by "colored eyes", they said they
               were very green. We asked if any of them recognized the female,
               and they all said no. She was last seen walking towards the
               stairwell, but none of them were sure if she had left the
               building. I asked Brandes if she told the female to leave her
               room at any point. She told me she told the female at least
               five times to get out, however the female would not listen. She
               said the female just continued repeating those three names.
               Brandes said the female pulled a box out from under her bed
               which contained food. There was a decorative gift box
               containing various microwavable foods next to Brandes' bed.
               Brandes said the female then pulled down her pants and began
               urinating inside of the box. Brandes told me the food inside
               cost approximately $40.00 and the box cost about $30.00. I took
               photographs of the box and food, and they were later uploaded

               into Spillman. Brandes told me the female would not leave her
               room so Brandes went to Samuels' room #316. Armstrong said she
               was in Samuels' room getting her hair braided. Brandes said the
               female followed her into room #316. Brandes, Samuels, and
               Armstrong said they told the female multiple times to leave,
               but she would not listen. Brandes said the female eventually
               left, and they contacted the Resident Advisors on duty, and
               that is when they called us. They told us there is a Payton and
               Veronica that live down the hallway in room #336. I asked how
               the female entered room #316. Armstrong told me she left their
               door unlocked when she walked down the hallway. However, they
               said their door was completely shut. I asked Brandes if she
               wanted to press charges, and she said yes because she was upset
               about what happened to her things. I asked Brandes and
               Armstrong if anything appeared to be missing from their room,
               and they both said no. I advised them to keep their door
               locked. I told them to contact me if they have any other
               information about the female is. Ofc. Kirshner and I went to
               room #336. I knocked on the door, and a female later identified
               as Payton N. Brusse (DOB 02-03-97), answered the door. I asked
               Brusse if she was aware of a female urinating in someone else's
               room, and she said no. I told Brusse she kept saying her name
               and her roommates name so she probably knows the female. I
               described the female to Brusse, and she told me she is unsure
               who that may be. Brusse told me her roommate "Veronica" is out
               of town. I told Brusse to give me a call if she finds out any
               information. We cleared the scene. The investigation continues.
               My Vievu camera was left at the office because I was
               downloading videos. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 8th day of November,
               2015, in Pullman, Washington.
