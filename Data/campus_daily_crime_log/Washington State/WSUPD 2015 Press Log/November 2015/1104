    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: JAK/333 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5569 SYNOPSIS: Whitcom received a
               burglary alarm from the WSU Museum of Anthropology. Sgt. Macy
               and I responded and determined the alarm had been accidentally
               set off by an employee. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               2. NARRATIVE: On 11-04-15, Whitcom "Toned" the WSU Police
               Department to the WSU Museum of Anthropology, which is located
               in College Hall. Sergeant Macy and I responded. Upon our
               arrival, we were contacted by a white female who said she works
               in the building and had set the alarm off when opening the
               Museum. I identified the female as Joann I. Bonner (01-01-63).
               Bonner said she entered her alarm code incorrectly and by the
               time she tried to re-enter her code correctly, the alarm had
               sounded. She was able to re-set the alarm prior to our arrival
               and had called Whitcom. Whitcom advised Bonner was not listed
               as a responsible according to their premise list. I advised
               Bonner the Department needed to send an updated "Responsible"
               list to Whitcom. She said she would do so. As there was no
               emergency in the Museum, Sgt. Macy and I cleared. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 5th day of November, 2015, in Pullman,

               School of Biological Sciences called, concerned for the welfare
               of a WSU student. I determined the student has left WSU and
               does not appear to be any type of threat. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 11-05-15, Larry
               Hufford called Whitcom, wanting to speak with an Officer about
               the welfare of a WSU student. I called Hufford and asked what I
               could do for him. Hufford explained he is the Director for the
               School of Biological Sciences in Hulbert Hall. He said Alex
               Webb was a Graduate student in the School of Biological
               Sciences who had suddenly dropped out of the program. He said
               he had heard from some students and faculty about some
               statements Webb had made regarding the Graduate Program. It
               sounds like these statements were things like there should be
               no requirements in order to get into the Graduate Program and
               was calling for the resignation of Hufford. Hufford said he had
               never even spoken with Webb so he was not sure why he would
               have called for his resignation. Hufford said he had heard Webb
               had actually left Pullman, but was not sure. He gave me the e-
               mail address for Webb's roommate, Steven Micheletti. I
               contacted Micheletti and asked him what he knew about Webb. He
               said he had been his roommate for nearly 2 years. He said Webb
               had always been a bit of a loner, but said it had gotten
               increasingly so in the past 6 months. He verified Webb had left
               Pullman in the week of 10-26-15 - 11-01-15. He said he believed
               Webb was currently somewhere in California, but was not sure.
               Micheletti said Webb had never shown any propensity to harm
               himself or others and said he had never seen Webb violent. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this ____ day of _____________, 2015, in

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: dd/329 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5584 SYNOPSIS: Agency assist for WCSO on
               Whelan Rd for a Domestic Dispute. Subject was detained and
               turned over to WCSO. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 11-04-15 at approximately 2145 hours, I heard
               WCSO dispatched to 2201 Whelan Rd. This is the location WSU
               Officers responded to the night before to assist with a
               suicidal subject. I advised Whitcom we were available if
               needed. WCSO asked for us to respond as they were in route from
               Colfax. Ofc. Westerman, Ofc. Whitman, and I responded to the
               house. While in route we were advised the subject, Julian
               Lester, was outside and it was unknown if he had any weapons. I
               was aware the night before he had access to a .22 caliber
               rifle. He had also been using several knives to threaten
               himself and damage property in the house the night before.
               Whitcom advised he had broken items inside the house and when
               they told the RP to lock the door, they stated Lester was
               threatening to burn the house down. The RP stated Lester had
               access to tools and items to cause a fire. As we arrived, I had
               Ofc. Westerman prepare a less lethal bean bag shotgun. I had a
               rifle, and Whitman was designated handgun/taser. Since Lester
               was outside somewhere, we approached on foot with Whitman
               driving a vehicle for lighting and the PA. When we got close to
               the driveway, I could hear Lester screaming from the front
               yard. We put the spotlight on him and began to give him verbal
               commands. When we were approximately 50 yards away, we ordered
               him to walk out to the driveway showing us his hands. Lester
               continued screaming and began taking off his coat, sweatshirt,
               and shirt. I continued to yell commands at him and he began to
               comply. He eventually came out to the driveway and laid down in
               the gravel. Ofc. Whitman handcuffed Lester and he was advised
               he was being detained. Lester was still yelling and stated
               several times he was done and just wanted to leave. He was
               advised he was being recorded and he was advised of his Miranda
               Warnings. He was patted down and a pocket knife was removed
               from his pocket, which was later given to Deputy Nebe. At this
               time, WCSO Deputies Nebe and Pelissier arrived on scene and I
               advised them of what had happened. We remained with Lester,
               putting his coat over his shoulders until Deputy Waltz arrived.
               We then escorted him to Deputy Waltz's vehicle and placed him
               in the rear seat. We cleared when WCSO stated we could. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 4th day of November, 2015, in Pullman,

               NARRATIVE: On 11/04/15 around 2155 hrs Ofc Petlovany, who was
               responding to another call advised Whitcom he had been in a
               collision on Stadium Wy near Valley Rd. I responded and upon my
               arrival I could see Petlovany's vehicle in lane 2 of the
               Northbound Lane on Stadium Wy and a second vehicle in the
               intersection of the left turn lane coming off of Valley Rd. I
               asked Petlovany if he was all right and was to was un-injured
               before I began to photograph both vehicles and the collision
               scene as I found it upon my arrival. Ofc Umbright, of the
               Pullman Police Department, arrived a short time later and the
               scene was turned over to him. Prior to my clearing I asked him
               if he wanted me to assist with anything else and told him I had
               already photographed the scene as I had found it upon my
               arrival. Umbright told me that was fine and I agreed to send
               him the photos I had taken, which I did upon my return to the
               WSU Police Department. Nothing further. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               4th day of November, 2015 in Pullman, Washington.
