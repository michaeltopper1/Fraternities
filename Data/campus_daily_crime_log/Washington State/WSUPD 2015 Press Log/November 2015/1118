               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5924 SYNOPSIS: Hit and run collision
               occurred at the intersection of Stadium Way and North Fairway
               Lane. No suspects or leads at this time. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 11/18/5 at about 2118
               hours I was dispatched to a hit and run collision that had
               occurred about an hour earlier. The reporting party, Stephanie
               J. Winchell, was the driver of the vehicle that was struck. She
               was in the parking lot near the old "Bookie". I responded and
               talked to Winchell, and her friend, Rachel N. Montgomery, who
               was in the passenger seat at the time of the collision.
               Winchell explained she was traveling southbound on Stadium Way
               when a vehicle traveling westbound on North Fairway Ln. and
               turning onto Stadium Way struck her vehicle in the
               intersection. North Fairway Ln. has a stop sign at the "T"
               intersection where it meets with Stadium Way. Winchell said as
               the vehicle was turning onto Stadium Way it struck the driver
               side of her vehicle towards the front. She said the vehicle
               then continued southbound on Stadium Way and did not stop.
               Winchell said she followed the vehicle for a ways but it was
               traveling fast. She lost site of it near the French
               Administration building. Winchell said the vehicle was a silver
               sedan and it may have had a Washington license plate. She said
               the damage to the silver vehicle would be on the front
               passenger side of the vehicle. Winchell pointed out the damage
               to her vehicle on the driver side front quarter panel and also
               said that she was not able to open the driver's door all of the
               way due to the damage. I photographed Winchell's vehicle and
               gave her my card with the case number. Winchell provided me
               with her insurance information. I went back to the station and
               looked at the cameras in the area to see if I could see the
               collision or identify the vehicle involved. I was unable to see
               the collision or vehicle on any of the cameras in the area. I
               drove through the parking lots on the south side of campus near
               where the vehicle was last seen. I could not find any silver
               colored vehicles with damage on the front passenger side. PTCR
               completed. No suspects, or leads at this time. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               19th day of November, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               about 2328 hours I was driving on Cougar Way when I observed a
               female being held up and helped to walk by two other females.
               The female being helped, later identified as Lydia S. Fields,
               appeared to be intoxicated she was staggering even with help
               and it appeared at times she had little to no control of her
               legs while she was attempting to walk. I contacted the three
               females. The two helping Fields said they were taking her home
               and would take care of her. Fields sat down because she was
               having difficulties standing. I noticed there were holes in the
               knee areas of her pants on both sides. There was blood coming
               from scrapes on her knees. I asked what happened to her knees
               and Fields said "what are you talking about?" Fields speech was
               slurred. I asked if Fields had identification on her, she could
               not find it. I asked her how old she was, she said "I swear". I
               asked her what her name was, she said "yap, no". Officer
               Westerman arrived on scene. Fields friend found her Cougar Card
               and handed it to me. I then asked Fields what her date of birth
               was, she said "five thirteen thirteen". I asked again what year
               and she kept saying thirteen. I asked how old she was and she
               kept saying "what". Officer Westerman asked if she knew where
               she was, she answered "springtown". He asked who the President
               of the United States was, she said "dude". He asked what month
               it was she was not able to answer. I radioed dispatch and asked
               them to have Pullman Ambulance respond to my location for an
               intoxicated female. I decided to take Fields into protective
               custody due to her high level of intoxication. Officer
               Westerman explained to Fields that she was in protective
               custody and not free to leave. Pullman Ambulance arrived and
               Fields was helped to the gurney. They transported her to
               Pullman Regional Hospital. I followed in my vehicle. Once at
               PRH I talked to medical staff and filled out the protective
               custody form. The doctor signed the form. I cleared the
               hospital and returned to the station. I downloaded the video
               from the camera at the southwest corner of Global Scholars Hall
               for the time of the incident. I attached the video to the
               digital evidence folder. Forward report to counseling services

               15 at approximately 0010 hours I was on patrol heading
               northbound on Stadium Way, when I observed a silver, 1997
               Toyota 4 Runner (WA Lic. AMJ4386) that appeared to be traveling
               above the posted 20 mph speed limit. I activated vehicle 41
               radar in the moving mode and it emitted a loud and steady high
               pitched audio tone and displayed the Toyota's speed as 34 mph
               in a 20 mph zone. My vehicle speed matched in the radar. I
               operated MPH Python III Directional Radar Serial #846003941,
               tuning fork number 283191 and 282809. Both tuning forks are
               certified. I checked the calibration of the SMD before my shift
               and it is in proper working order. I turned around and
               activated my emergency lights. The vehicle came to a stop at
               the entrance to the Fine Arts Parking Garage off of Stadium
               Way. I contacted the driver of the vehicle, who was later
               identified as Jordan S. Marti (DOB 11-18-96), by his WA
               driver's license. I told Marti the reason I pulled him over was
               for speeding, and I told him I was recording. Marti had only
               rolled down his window a little less than halfway. I could
               smell the strong odor of burnt marijuana coming from the
               vehicle. I asked to see his driver's license, vehicle
               registration, and proof of insurance. Marti provided me with
               all three. I told Marti and his passenger to wait in the
               vehicle and I would be back in a few minutes. I returned to my
               vehicle and radioed Dispatch to do a driver's check on Marti.
               Marti returned clear and current. Dispatch advised Marti has
               had past local contacts for marijuana while on campus. I asked
               Dispatch to send me another unit because there was possibly
               drugs inside of the vehicle. Ofc. Westerman soon arrived on
               scene as backup officer. I re-contacted Marti and I asked him
               how much marijuana was in the vehicle, and he said "none". I
               asked Marti to please step out of the vehicle and he did. We
               walked over to the nearby sidewalk. I again asked him about
               marijuana in the vehicle and he told me there was none. I asked

               Marti how much he had to smoke tonight, and he said none. I
               asked him why his vehicle smelled like marijuana, and he told
               me he had smoked in it a previous night. I asked him when the
               last night he smoked in it was, and he said "not tonight, it
               was a couple days ago". Marti later said he smoked marijuana in
               the vehicle yesterday. I asked him where he was smoking, and he
               said just that he was driving around. I asked Marti if he would
               be willing to take some voluntary field sobriety tests, and he
               said "sure". The area I administered the tests was on a paved
               and level sidewalk. The weather was clear and cold. I asked him
               to stand with his feet together and arms by his side, and to
               remain in that position until I told him to do otherwise. He
               told me understood. I asked him if he was sick or injured, and
               he told me had a cold. I asked him if he took any medications,
               and he said Nyquil at night. I asked him if he took any
               tonight, and he said no. Marti was wearing jeans, hoodie, and
               van type tennis shoes. Lighting was provided by my vehicle
               spotlight and my flashlight. I checked Marti's eyes and noticed
               they tracked equally and his pupils were equal in size. I did
               not see resting nystagmus in either eye. I did not see lack of
               smooth pursuit or distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum
               deviation. I did not see any vertical nystagmus in either eye.
               His eyes appeared bloodshot. The next test I administered was
               the walk and turn. I explained to him the starting position and
               I asked him to stay in that position until I told him to begin,
               and he said he understood. Before I began to demonstrate a few
               heel to toe steps for Marti he got out of the starting
               position. I asked him to get back into the starting position
               and he did. Marti had body tremors while he was in the starting
               position. After I finished explaining and demonstrating the
               test, Marti said he did not have any questions for me and said
               he understood the test. During the walk and turn test Marti
               stepped off line at least 7 times. During the one leg stand
               test Marti got out of the starting position twice and he
               exhibited extreme leg tremors. He began with his right leg
               elevated, but not high enough. I told him to raise it higher.
               He was leaning to the left and his left leg was shaking the
               entire time. Marti refused to take the PBT. I asked Ofc.
               Westerman to administer a couple of additional tests for me.
               After completing the additional tests Ofc. Westerman told me he
               observed strong eyelid, arm, and leg tremors from Marti. Marti
               was arrested for minor operating a motor vehicle after
               consuming marijuana. I transported Marti to Pullman PD while I
               applied for a search warrant. **Report not finished** I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.
