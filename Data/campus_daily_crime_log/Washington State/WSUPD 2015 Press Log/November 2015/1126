               sighting. I responded to the area where I made contact with the
               complainant who pointed out where the animal was last seen in
               the grass hillside. I saw the animal, it was a coyote, not a

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W6078 SYNOPSIS: Panic alarm at the
               Veterinary Teaching Hospital. Officers arrived on scene and
               there was no emergency in the area. Panic button was
               accidentally pressed. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               2. NARRATIVE: On 11-27-15 at approximately 0533 hours WSU
               Police Officers were toned out to a panic alarm at the
               Veterinary Teaching Hospital, located at 200 SE Ott Rd.
               Dispatch advised the panic alarm was coming from the small
               animal ICU room #1604. Assistant Chief Hansen and I arrived on
               scene. We went to ICU room #1604 and there did not appear
               anyone inside needed assistance. I contacted a male later
               identified as Alex B. Stone (DOB 03-22-89) inside of the room.
               I asked Stone if he accidentally bumped the panic switch, and
               he said he did not even know there was one inside of the room.
               We walked around and did not observe anyone in the area needing
               assistance. There was an audible alarm sounding in the lobby
               and Dispatch advised the alarm had not yet reset. I asked
               Dispatch to have WSU Facilities Operations to respond to reset
               the alarm. Once WSU Facilities Operations arrived on scene we
               cleared the scene. No further action. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               27th day of November, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.
