               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W6039 SYNOPSIS: Mother requesting
               a welfare check on her son. He was contacted and asked to call
               home. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               11-22-15 at about 0926 hours I was dispatched to the report of
               a welfare check at Gannon Hall room 620. Whitcom advised that
               the mother of student, Sammy Bushacra, was requesting we check
               on her son. The unidentified mother stated she had not talked
               with Sammy for a few days and was worried. The mother lives in
               Kuwait and there was a language barrier. No other information
               was obtained. I went to Gannon room 620 and saw the name
               "Sammy" on a name tag. I knocked on the door and a male said
               "who is it". I stated it was the police department and asked
               him to open the door. A male answered the door and I asked if
               he was Sammy. He said yes. I told him why I was there and he
               said he has had his phone off or on silent for the last few
               days because of a recent breakup. I told Sammy that his mother
               was worried about him and asked him to call her. He said he
               would. I spoke with Sammy about his plans for Thanksgiving
               break and he said he would be in Pullman by himself for the
               week. I asked him if he was depressed about his break up and he
               said he was sad and just wanted to be alone. I asked Sammy if
               he has ever thought of hurting himself and he said "no, I'm not
               stupid!" I spoke with Sammy about local resources available to
               him if he needed to talk with somebody about his break up or if
               he was feeling depressed. Sammy answered all of my questions
               and said he'd call home. Nothing further. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               22nd day of November, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               believe to be illegal drugs in Stephenson South room 931 during
               room checks for Thanksgiving break. Investigation continues.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 11-22-
               15 at about 1112 hours I was dispatched to the report of drugs
               at Stephenson South room 931. The RP, Dustin Cooper, advised
               that during room checks for Thanksgiving Break, the RA for the
               floor found what they thought was illegal drugs on the desk of
               one of the residents. At about 1230 hours I met with Cooper at
               room 931. I asked him what their protocol was for room checks.
               He told me that they are supposed to report "up the chain" and
               to the police when they find what is believed to be drugs in
               open view in a room. I asked Cooper what was found and he said
               there was some "prescription like pills" that were not in a
               prescription bottle, but rather in a clear plastic bag. I told
               Cooper that I am not allowed to go into the room without a
               search warrant, and based on the information he was providing
               me I did not have enough for a search warrant. He stated he
               understood. I asked Cooper for the resident's names, which he
               provided. The resident's of the room are Annie Hoch and
               Kasandra Numair. I will attempt contact with them and ask what
               the pills are. Investigation continues. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               did not return home from break and was 3 days overdue. Subject
               was subsequently located by friends. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 11/22/15 at about 2125 hrs
               Dispatch advised of a subject who was requesting a welfare
               check on her son, Brandon C. Gutierrez. They also advised the
               subjects father called earlier in the day, at about 1600 hrs,
               and spoke with Officer Olmstead who was unable to locate the
               son at that time. I attempted to contact the complainant,
               Patricia K. Noklebymayville, but was unable to do so initially.
               I went to her son's apartment, Chinook Village P67, and knocked
               on the door. All the lights were off and no one answered the
               door. It appeared there was no one inside the apartment. I
               attempted to call Noklebymayville again and was able to contact
               her. She told me she last spoke to Gutierrez on the morning of
               11/19/15 and he was supposed to be home that evening.
               Noklebymayville told me Gutierrez was previously on some
               medications for acne that he quit taking about a month ago. One
               of the side effects of stopping the medication is the
               possibility of suicidal thoughts. She also advised that
               Gutierrez's grandmother passed away recently and he had been
               very close with her. I asked if he made any suicidal threats or
               comments to her and she told me it is difficult to pick up on
               things with him. He is very intelligent but "different" and it
               makes it difficult to have a normal conversation with him. I
               had Corporal Kuhrt and Officer Stewart respond. We keyed into
               Guiterrez's apartment to make sure he was not inside and
               incapacitated due to a self inflicted injury. We checked the
               apartment and found no one inside. While looking for Guiterrez
               in the apartment I noticed a sign on a bedroom door with the
               name Tyler Herman. I contacted Noklebymayville and informed her
               we did not find her son in the apartment. I located Herman's
               phone number in Spillman and contacted him on the phone. He
               told me he last saw Guiterrez on 11/21/15 at about 0830 hrs.
               Herman said Guiterrez had planned on going home Friday but some
               of his friends showed up at the apartment so he stayed longer.
               Herman did not know any of the friend's names. Guiterrez was
               just getting up from bed when Herman left the apartment for
               break on 11/21/15. Herman also said Guiterrez's phone was water
               damaged and was not working at all. I informed Noklebymayville
               of the updated information I received from Herman. A short time
               after hanging up the phone Dispatch advised she called back and
               said Guiterrez was located and was safe. I called

               Noklebymayville and she told me one of Guiterrez's previous
               roommates called her and said Guiterrez was ok and was en-route
               home from Pullman at the moment. They also confirmed
               Guiterrez's phone was not working. Noklebymayville said she had
               already been on the phone with Guiterrez's father and told him
               everything was ok. She also asked me to inform Officer Olmstead
               Guitterrez was located. Nothing further. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               23 day of November, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.
