               leads. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               11-13-2015 at about 1212 hrs I was dispatched to a report of a
               hit and run vehicle collision in the Center for Undergraduate
               Education (CUE) Building Parking Garage, located at 300 NE Troy
               Lane. I contacted the complainant, Elizabeth D. Hart (DOB 11-
               08-1987), in the police department lobby. Hart said on 11-13-
               2015 at about 0800 hrs she parked her black, 2006 Ford F250
               truck (WA Lic. C37475A) on the 4th floor of the CUE Parking
               Garage. Hart said later that same day at about 1200 hrs she
               returned to her vehicle in the parking garage. Hart observed
               several pieces of broken plastic on the front bumper of her
               vehicle and on the ground near the front of her vehicle. Hart
               said the plastic pieces appeared to be similar to a clear lens
               cover from another vehicle. Hart said her vehicle was not
               damaged. Hart speculated that another vehicle must have
               collided with the front bumper of her vehicle, causing damage
               to the other vehicle, and then drove away. Hart requested that
               the incident be documented and provided photographs of the
               scene. The photographs have been downloaded into Spillman and
               attached to this case. No further action at this time.

               in Todd Hall. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 11/13/15 around 1638 hrs I was dispatched to a
               report of wallet being lost in Todd Hall, and when returned was
               missing $110.00 in cash. I contacted the reporting party, later
               identified as Brittany E Srp (11/13/96) and was told the
               following. Srp explained she had been waiting in the hallway on
               the ground floor of Todd Hall around 1500 hrs for her class to
               begin. She told me she had tried to make a phone call, but due
               to a bad cell signal she had left the area along with her
               belongings which included her wallet. When she returned she
               noticed her wallet was gone. Following her class she told me
               she began to search some social media sites and was contacted
               about her wallet being found in the bathroom of Todd Hall. Srp
               made arrangements to retrieve her wallet and upon meeting with
               the individual who had found it, later identified as Jacqueline
               S Aurandt (10/02/96), she realized she was missing $110.00 in
               cash. She did not confront Aurandt regarding the missing funds
               and did not believe she had taken it. I asked if she had any
               additional information on Aurandt and was told she met her at
               the Stephenson Complex and believed she lives there, but did
               not know which tower. When asked if she had a phone number to
               contact her I was told she did not, and they had been texting
               back and forth regarding her wallet. Srp had no idea who may
               have taken her wallet, but did add she had not been in the
               bathroom in Todd prior to her wallet missing. At this point I
               provided Srp with my business card and case number for
               reference in addition to discussing security of her items. I
               told her I would contact Aurandt and see what she had to say
               and she asked me to make sure she knew she did not think she
               had anything to do with the theft. I told her I would convey
               that and we concluded our conversation a short time later at
               which time Srp left. A short time after Srp had left I
               attempted to contact Aurandt and left her a message to contact
               me. Around 1800 hrs I received a phone call from Aurandt and
               asked her what she could tell me regarding this wallet. Aurandt
               told me she had been in the third floor bathroom of Todd Hall
               around 1500 hrs and had noticed a wallet sitting there. I asked
               her if she went through the wallet and she told me she did at
               which point she found a Cougar Card with Srp's name. When asked
               what was in the wallet she told me just a bunch of papers. I
               asked her how much money was in the wallet and she did not
               recall seeing any. She went on to tell me she had posted online

               about finding the wallet and was contacted by Srp and arranged
               to meet her at the Stephenson Complex where she returned the
               wallet to her. I asked her why she took the wallet and didn't
               simply drop it off at the lost and found in Todd Hall or bring
               it to the WSU Police Department. She told me she didn't even
               think about those options before leaving and being contacted by
               Srp. We briefly discussed this issue and options in the event
               this happens again before concluding our conversation. At this
               time there are no suspects and no leads. I recommend this case

               respond to WCSO jail for the evaluation. While enroute Taylor
               called and notified me he had a 20 year old male, Adan Tamayo-
               Garcia, in custody for DUI. Taylor said Tamayo admitted to
               smoking marijuana and had approximately 1 ounce in the car with
               him. I responded to WCSO jail and waited for Taylor until 2215
               hours when I began the evaluation. WSP could not get in touch
               with a tow out of Colfax, so Taylor had to wait for a tow from
               Pullman. I met with Tamayo in the BAC room. I asked Tamayo if
               he remembered his Miranda Rights that Taylor read to him and he
               said he did. I explained the DRE Evaluation and told Tamayo his
               rights still applied during the evaluation. At the end of the
               evaluation it was my opinion as a certified DRE that Tamayo was
               not impaired, but was exhibiting signs of having consumed
               marijuana. I told Taylor my findings and he pursued a search
               warrant. See supplement for complete details of evaluation. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 14th day of November, 2015, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer

               from the vehicle. The driver and passengers were all under the
               age of 21. The registered owner of the vehicle gave the
               officers permission to search the vehicle, and multiple joints
               were found inside the vehicle. Charges forwarded on one of the

               Marijuana/False Statements NARRATIVE: On 11-14-15 at
               approximately 0025 hours I was on patrol heading northbound on
               Stadium Way near Vogel, when I observed a silver, 2002 BMW 325
               (WA Lic. AWJ6613) that appeared to be traveling above the
               posted 20 mph speed limit. I activated vehicle 41 radar in the
               moving mode and it emitted a loud and increasing high pitched
               audio tone and displayed the BMW's speed as 39 mph in a 20 mph
               zone. My vehicle speed matched with the radar. I operated MPH
               Python III Directional Radar Serial #846003941, tuning fork
               number 283191 and 282809. Both tuning forks are certified. I
               checked the calibration of the SMD before my shift and it is in
               proper working order. I later checked the calibration of the
               SMD after my shift and it was still in proper working order. I
               turned around and activated my emergency lights. The vehicle
               came to a stop on Stadium Way near the Fine Arts Parking
               garage. I contacted the driver of the vehicle who was later
               identified as Paul E. Johnson (DOB 08-03-96) by his WA driver's
               license. I advised Johnson I was audio and video recording. I
               told Johnson the reason I pulled him over was for speeding. I
               asked to see his driver's license, vehicle registration, and
               proof of insurance. Johnson told me he did not have his vehicle
               registration or proof of insurance in the vehicle, but he
               handed me his driver's license. I could smell the strong odor
               of marijuana coming from the vehicle. There was a passenger in
               the front seat, and one in the back seat sitting on the right
               side. I told them to wait in the vehicle and I would be back. I
               returned to my patrol vehicle, and I radioed Dispatch to run a
               records check on Johnson. Johnson's return came back clear. I
               asked Dispatch to have another officer respond to my location
               because there may be drugs inside of the vehicle. I walked back
               up to the vehicle and re-contacted Johnson. I asked him how

               much marijuana he had in the vehicle, and he said "none". I
               asked him how long ago he smoked, and he told me he did not
               smoke anything tonight. I asked him if he would be willing to
               take some voluntary field sobriety tests, and he said he would
               take them. I asked him to exit the vehicle and he did. Ofc.
               Westerman soon arrived on scene as backup officer. Ofc.
               Westerman had WSUPD Intern Tyler Peters with him. I
               administered the field sobriety tests and determined he was not
               impaired. Again, I asked Johnson if there was any marijuana in
               the vehicle, and he said no. Ofc. Westerman asked if him or any
               of his passengers had a medical marijuana card, and he said no.
               I asked him if I wanted permission to search his vehicle if
               that would be okay with him, and he said "yeah, if you wanted".
               I asked Johnson to go wait in his vehicle. I later returned and
               I again asked Johnson if I had his permission to search his
               vehicle, and he said yeah. I asked him and his passengers to
               please step out of the vehicle and they did. The other two
               passengers were later identified as Issac L. Lykes (DOB 06-06-
               97) and Kelan A. Robinson (DOB 11-29-97). Lykes was the
               passenger in the front seat, and Robinson was sitting in the
               back seat behind Lykes. Ofc. Westerman had the individuals
               stand near my patrol car, while I explained the Ferrier
               Warnings to Johnson. I told him he had the right to refuse,
               restrict, or revoke the search at any time. Johnson seemed to
               understand. Intern Peters and I began to search the vehicle.
               Intern Peters found a sandwich size Ziploc bag located in the
               backseat underneath the front passenger seat. The Ziploc bag
               contained four rolled joints all containing fresh green
               vegetable material (GVM). Based on my training and experience
               the GVM appeared to be fresh marijuana. The Ziploc bag
               containing the four rolled joints with fresh GVM was seized and
               later logged into evidence. When I asked Johnson, Lykes, and
               Robinson who the marijuana belonged to, they kept saying they
               did not even know it was in the vehicle. They said it belonged
               to a friend who they had dropped off at a party earlier. I told
               them the odor of marijuana was very strong in their vehicle and
               they should have known it was in there. However, they kept
               saying they just came from a party where people were smoking,
               and that's why they thought the vehicle smelled like it. Ofc.
               Westerman was not getting a records check return for Lykes
               because he was not providing his correct information. Ofc.
               Westerman detained him in handcuffs until he could further
               investigate why Lykes was not providing him with the correct
               information. See Ofc. Westerman's supplemental report. Lykes
               was later released from custody. I explained to all three of
               them that I believe the marijuana belonged to one of them, and
               that they all knew it was in the vehicle. I told Robinson I
               would be forwarding charges on him to the Whitman County
               Prosecuting Attorney's Office for possession of marijuana. I
               explained to him the marijuana was found near where he was
               sitting, and he was in constructive possession of the
               marijuana. I verbally warned Johnson for speeding, no vehicle
               registration, and no proof of insurance. I told them they were
               all free to go. Ofc. Westerman, Intern Peters, and I cleared
               the scene. I later returned to the police department where I

               weighed the Ziploc Sandwich bag containing the joints, and the
               fresh GVM. The net weight was 8.11 grams. I NIK tested the GVM,
               and it came back presumptive positive for THC. I took
               photographs of the bag containing the GVM and the NIK test,
               they were later uploaded into Spillman. No further action. My
               Vievu camera was activated, and the video was later downloaded

               suspects or leads. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 11/14/15 at approximately 0050 hours I was
               dispatched to the 3rd floor of Goldsworthy Hall for graffiti on
               a bulletin board. Upon arrival I found the word "Freedom" spray
               painted in red. The spray paint appeared old. I spoke with the
               RA's on duty and they said that when they did their rounds at
               2130 hours there was paper on the board and they didn't see the
               graffiti. When they did rounds at 0045 hours they found the
               graffiti because the paper on the board had been torn down. I
               photographed the graffiti and later added it to the case. On
               11/14/15 at approximately 2010 hours I called the hall director
               Brittany Griffin and asked about the graffiti. Griffin said the
               graffiti had been on the bulletin board for approximately 3
               years. I checked Spillman for prior malicious mischief calls on
               the third floor of Goldsworthy Hall since 2010 and did not find
               it reported. No suspects or leads at this time. I certify and

               Schmidt 12/02/96 Charges Forwarded MIP Exhibiting 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 11/14/15 at approximately 0041 hours I was driving eastbound
               on Cougar Way near Einstein Bagels when I noticed a female and
               male near the entrance to Einstein Bagels. The female, later
               identified as Gabriela Fernandez Schmidt 12/02/96, was having
               difficulty balancing even though the male was holding her up by
               her arm. Schmidt was wobbly as she walked and stumbled forward
               at one point. Schmidt was trying quickly to get to a planter
               box. It appeared as if Schmidt was about to vomit. Schmidt
               appeared to be under the age of 21. I passed the two and turned
               around to contact Schmidt. I parked near Global Scholars Hall
               and walked up to the two. When I reached them, Schmidt was
               vomiting against the wall of Einstein Bagels. I asked Schmidt
               if she was ok and Schmidt stood up. The male, later identified
               as Omar Ramadan Chokr 05/07/97, was still holding Schmidt up by
               her arm. I asked Schmidt a series of questions to determine her
               mental status. Schmidt was able to answer all them correctly.
               Schmidt's words were slurred as she spoke. I asked Schmidt if
               she was able to stand on her own and Chokr let go of her.
               Schmidt started to instantly stumble backwards before Chokr
               grabbed Schmidt by the shoulders. I asked Schmidt if she had
               her ID with her and she said no. I asked Schmidt if I could
               look at her eyes and she said I could. I told Schmidt to stand
               with her heels and toes together while keeping her arms at her
               sides. I told Schmidt to follow the tip of my pen with her eyes
               only while keeping her head still. As soon as I moved my pen
               Schmidt moved her head to follow the pen. I reminded Schmidt to
               keep her head still. During the test I observed, equal
               tracking, lack of smooth pursuit, and distinct and sustained
               nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes. Schmidt eyes were
               bloodshot and watery. As Schmidt stood before me I could smell
               the odor of intoxicants coming from her breath. I asked Schmidt
               how much she had to drink tonight and she said, "not very
               much." I asked how much that was for her and Schmidt said,"I
               think I've had two ish." I asked Schmidt for her name verbally.
               Due to Schmidt's high intoxication level she told me her last
               name was spelled "SMIDT" and spelled her first name
               "GABBRIELLE." After talking to Schmidt for a while she was able
               to remember the correct way to spell her name. I asked Schmidt
               if she was willing to provide a PBT sample and she said no. I

               told Schmidt that I would be forwarding charges of MIP
               Exhibiting to the Prosecutor and explained the process. I asked
               Chokr if he was willing to watch over Schmidt and he said yes.
               I asked Schmidt if she was ok with Chokr taking care of her and
               she said yes. I told Schmidt that she was free to go and I
               cleared. END OF REPORT I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the

               06/29/96 Charges Forwarded MIP Exhibiting 2. NARRATIVE: On
               11/14/15 at approximately 0121 hours I was driving northbound
               on Thatuna St near Wilmer Davis when I noticed a female, later
               identified as Lindsay Nicole Przybylski 06/29/96, walking near
               Thatuna and Linden St. The female was stumbling side to side as
               she walked. Przybylski appeared to be unsteady on her feet.
               Przybylski was walking towards me and as I passed her I noticed
               that she appeared to be under the age of 21. After just passing
               Przybylski I came to a stop in the roadway and watched her in
               my side mirror. I watched as Przybylski stopped walking and
               pulled her cell phone from her pocket. As Przybylski stood
               still looking at her phone, Przybylski stumbled forward and
               then over corrected her balance and stumbled backwards. I
               pulled around the block and found Przybylski walking the
               opposite way towards Linden Street. I pulled along side
               Przybylski and contacted her. I asked Przybylski if I could
               talk to her for a minute and she stopped. I explained what I
               had witnessed and Przybylski said she was not stumbling and she
               was fine. I asked for Przybylski's ID and she said she did not
               have it. Przybylski provided her name and date of birth
               verbally. Przybylski identified herself as 19 years old. I
               asked Przybylski if I could look at her eyes and she said I
               could. I told Przybylski to stand with her heels and toes
               together while keeping her arms at her sides. I told Przybylski
               to follow the tip of my pen with her eyes only while keeping
               her head still. During the test I observed equal tracking, lack
               of smooth pursuit, and distinct and sustained nystagmus at
               maximum deviation in both eyes. Przybylski's eyes were watery
               and bloodshot. During the test Przybylski kept moving her head
               to follow the pen instead of keeping it still. I could smell
               the odor of intoxicants coming from Przybylski's breath as she
               stood before me. I asked Przybylski how much she had to drink
               tonight and she said she had four Keystone beers. I asked
               Przybylski if she was willing to provided a voluntary breath
               sample and she said no. I told Przybylski that she was under
               arrest for MIP and I handcuffed (D/L) her. I advised Przybylski
               that she was being audio and video recorded. I read Przybylski
               her Miranda Rights off my department issued card. Przybylski
               said she understood her rights. I placed Przybylski in the back
               seat of my patrol car as I researched her local involvements. I

               found that Przybylski had been arrested on 02/07/15 for MIP
               Exhibiting by Ofc. Whitman. I asked Przybylski about her arrest
               and Przybylski said the charges were dropped by the Prosecutor
               due to lack of evidence. Due to Przybylski high intoxication
               level I did not think she could walk the rest of the way home
               safely. I transported Przybylski to her Sorority at 850 NE
               Monore St. Once at the Sorority I told Przybylski that I would
               be forwarding charges of MIP Exhibiting to the Prosecutor and
               explained the process. I told Przybylski that she should stop
               drinking or she will keep getting in trouble. Przybylski was
               unhandcuffed and released from custody. END OF REPORT I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the

               approximately 0210 hours I was dispatched to the report of a
               trespassing at Kamiak Apartments, located at 1650 NE Valley Rd.
               #J1. Dispatched advised a male walked inside the complainant's
               apartment and immediately fell asleep on the couch. Sgt. Kuhrt,
               Ofc. Westerman, and I arrived on scene. The complainant, Tao
               Liu (DOB 02-15-86), let us inside of his apartment. There was a
               white, college aged male asleep on his couch. I approached the
               male and repeatedly told him to wake up, and I shook his
               shoulders gently. Ofc. Westerman rolled the male onto his side,
               and eventually the male woke up, and he sat upright on the
               couch. I advised him I was audio and video recording. The male
               was later identified as Randall G. Phelps (DOB 11-04-94) by his
               WA driver's license. I asked Phelps where he was, and he
               replied "someone's place". I asked him why he came here, and he
               said he did not know. Ofc. Westerman asked him whose place he
               was at right now, and he replied "I don't know". Sgt. Kuhrt
               asked Phelps where he lived, and he replied Campus Commons
               North. I asked Phelps how much he had to drink tonight, and he
               said "enough". I could smell the strong odor of intoxicants
               coming from his breath. Phelps had dirt on his pants as if he
               fell down earlier. I asked him if he fell earlier, and he said
               he did not remember. I asked Phelps if he would take a
               voluntary preliminary breath test (PBT), and he said "yeah,
               that's fine". He provided a breath sample of .182. Phelps was
               able to answer all of our questions we asked him. I asked Ofc.
               Westerman if Liu just wanted us to kick Phelps out of the
               apartment, and he said yes. I warned Phelps about criminal
               trespassing, and he said he understood. I provided him a
               courtesy transport to his apartment at Campus Commons North. I
               cleared the scene. No further action. My Vievu camera was
               activated, and the video was later downloaded into the
               permanent digital evidence folder. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 14th day of
