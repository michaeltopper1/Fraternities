               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5977 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched to a
               report of a vehicle prowl. The complainant reported that
               someone had entered his vehicle and took items from inside. No
               suspects or leads. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 11-20-2015 at about 1307 hrs I was dispatched to
               a report of a vehicle prowl in the "gray" parking lot located
               on south side of Stephenson South, 1285 SE Stadium Way. I
               arrived on scene and contacted the complainant, Hernan Nunez
               Ortega (DOB 02-02-1997). Ortega reported that on 11-19-2015 at
               about 2200 hrs he parked his silver, 2013 Scion coupe (WA Lic.
               ALL5517) in the parking lot. Ortega thought he locked the doors
               but was not sure. On 11-20-2015 at about 1130 hrs Ortega
               returned to his vehicle. Ortega discovered that someone had
               entered his vehicle and took two items from inside the
               passenger compartment. There was no sign of forced entry and no
               damage to the vehicle. Ortega noticed that the hood was
               unlatched and items from the console had been scattered around
               inside. Ortega said nothing appeared to be missing from the
               engine compartment. Ortega said his sunglasses and a charging
               cable for his Samsung Galaxy telephone were missing from inside
               his vehicle. The sunglasses were described as: Ray-Ban, black
               in color, dark polarized lens, value $150.00. The charging
               cable was described as: red in color, value $15.00. Ortega said
               nothing else was missing from his vehicle. No suspects or leads
               were identified. I photographed the vehicle, and the
               photographs were downloaded into Spillman and attached to this
               case. No further action at this time. Olmstead/339 I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.

               Conduct NARRATIVE: On 11/20/15 at approximately 2313 hours I
               was dispatched to a drugs call at Rogers Hall room 1025. The
               RED on duty was reporting the strong odor of marijuana coming
               from room 1025. The RED stated there sounded to be several
               people inside. Upon arrival I knocked on the door of room 1025
               and Mihainuan De Sa Silva 06/02/92 answered the door. As soon
               as De Sa Silva opened the door I could smell the very strong
               odor of burnt marijuana coming from the room. I told De Sa
               Silva why I was called to his room and asked how old he was. De
               Sa Silva said he was 23 years old. I explained that even though
               he was over 21 and could legally possess marijuana, it violates
               WSU Housing policies to smoke or possess it in a dorm room. I
               asked De Sa Silva if his roommate was home and Eduardo Mergen
               Peres 09/30/93 came to the door. I told the two that they
               needed to throw away their marijuana and both said that was
               fine. I walked De Sa Silva and Mergen Peres outside to the
               dumpster where they threw away their marijuana. I explained the
               laws regarding marijuana and told them they were free to go.

               11/21/15 at approximately 0045 hours Cougar Security Units
               called over the radio for an Officer to respond to Global
               Scholars Hall where an intoxicated male was attempting to get
               into the closed Market. Upon arrival I witnessed a male, later
               identified as Julian Alexander Khalifa 01/31/96, come stumbling
               out of the entry way of the market. Khalifa appeared to be well
               under the age of 21. I asked Khalifa if he was doing ok as he
               walked towards me. Khalifa said, "thank you so much" and held
               out his hand to shake mine. I was confused by Khalifa's answer
               to me asking if he was ok. I asked Khalifa if he lived nearby
               and Khalifa said something that I was unable to understand
               because he was slurring his words so heavily. I asked Khalifa
               if he had his ID and he provided me with his WSU Cougar Card. I
               asked Khalifa how old he was and he said 17 years old. I
               repeated what Khalifa said and he told me he was 19 years old.
               Khalifa provided his date of birth verbally. Khalifa identified
               himself as 19 years old. While talking with Khalifa, he was
               stumbling forwards and backwards and was unable to stand still
               without loosing his balance. I asked Khalifa how much he had to
               drink and Khalifa said not that much. Khalifa stumbled forwards
               into me and I had to put my hand up to prevent him from hitting
               me. I told Khalifa to stand still. I asked Khalifa if I could
               check his eyes and he said I could. I told Khalifa to stand
               with his heels and toes together while keeping his arms at his
               sides. I told Khalifa to follow the tip of my pen with his eyes
               only and not move his head. Khalifa nodded his head that he
               understood. As soon as I moved the pen Khalifa moved his head
               to follow. I told Khalifa to keep his head still and again he
               nodded that he understood. I moved my pen and again Khalifa
               moved his head. I told Khalifa for a third time to keep his
               head still and Khalifa still was moving it. I stopped the test
               at this point because Khalifa was unable to follow directions.
               While trying to do the test Khalifa was swaying back and forth
               severely. As Khalifa stood before me I could clearly smell the
               odor of intoxicants coming from his breath. I asked Khalifa if
               he was willing to take a voluntary PBT and he said he would. I
               found my PBT (Alco-Sensor FST #16805) in working condition.
               Khalifa provided a PBT sample of .255. I asked Khalifa a series
               of questions to determine his mental status. It took Khalifa

               several seconds to answer each question but he did answer them
               correctly. I told Khalifa that he was under arrest for MIP and
               handcuffed (D/L) him. I advised Khalifa of his right to counsel
               and that he was being audio and video recorded. Due to
               Khalifa's extremely high intoxication level, I did not believe
               that he could safely get back home. I transported Khalifa to
               his fraternity at 400 NE Colorado St. Once at his fraternity I
               told Khalifa that I would be forwarding charges of MIP
               Exhibiting to the prosecutor and explained the process. I
               released Khalifa from custody and told him he was free to go.
