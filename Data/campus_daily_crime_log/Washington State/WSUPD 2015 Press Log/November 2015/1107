               contacted the complainant, Ashley C. Andersen (DOB 04-02-1996).
               Andersen is the resident advisor for the third floor. Andersen
               directed me to the lobby on the third floor. I saw that the
               lobby had chairs, tables, and couches placed around the area.
               Anderson showed me an empty space in the lobby and told me a
               couch had been situated in this spot, but it was missing.
               Anderson said the couch was light green in color with wooden
               legs. Anderson said the couch was taken sometime between 2200
               hrs on 11-05-2015 and 0900 hrs on 11-06-2015. The value of the
               couch is estimated to be $500.00. Anderson showed me another
               couch in the lobby and told me it was identical to the one that
               was stolen. I photographed this couch, and the photographs were
               downloaded into Spillman and attached to this case. Anderson
               said she looked around the building but did not locate the
               couch. Anderson has no idea who might have taken the couch. No
               suspects or leads were identified. No further action at this

               park behind the building. Houston told him he couldn't due to
               it still being a construction site. The driver said ok and
               drove away. Later Houston spoke with a worker that was on the
               roof at the time on the contact. He stated that he saw another
               male come from the south side of the trailer holding something
               in his hands. Houston explained to me that was the side where
               the entrance door was. He went to the trailer and found that
               the two company laptops were missing. That was when he dialed
               911. He said the lap tops we Leceuro and valued at
               approximately $600 each. He said the other worker thought the
               vehicle had WSU Cougar plates, but didn't see the number. He
               said the vehicle went east on Grimes Way. I told him that
               because of the game it would be hard to find the vehicle, but
               we would try. I gave Houston the case number and told him that
               we would need the make model and serial numbers to be able to
               sign them as stolen. He said he would call the main office on
               Monday and get the information. More to
               follow.................. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 7th day of November,

               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. John R. Stack/032097
               Fwd Chgs MIP Exhibiting 2. NARRATIVE: On 11/08/15 at about 1249
               hrs I was working at the WSU vs Arizona St. football game. I
               was standing at the north end of the Student Plaza when I
               noticed a male, later identified as John R. Stack (032097), who
               was walking up to the entrance gate at the Student Plaza. Stack
               caught my attention because he appeared to be under 21 and was
               stumbling side to side as he walked. His head was also very
               wobbly as he walked. I contacted him as he reached the entrance
               gates and asked him to step to the side to speak with me. He
               did so and I asked how much he had to drink. He said not that
               much. I noticed Stack spoke with slurred speech and continued
               to be unsteady on his feet as he walked with me to the side of
               the gate. I asked how old he was and he said 18. I asked for
               his ID and he provided me with his Cougar Card and date of
               birth. I confirmed the information provided through Dispatch. I
               asked if I could check his eyes and Stack agreed. I
               administered a horizontal gaze nystagmus test on him and
               observed he had bloodshot and watery eyes, and a lack of smooth
               pursuit. I could smell the odor of intoxicants on Stack's
               breath during the test. Stack advised his father was not with
               him and was in the stadium already. I told Stack I would be
               forwarding charges for MIP Exhibiting to the Whitman County
               Prosecutor's office. I advised him he was trespassed from the
               stadium for the rest of the day and not to return. Stack was
               released. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 08 day of November,

               NARRATIVE: On 11-07-15 at approximately 1618 hours I was
               working the WSU Football Game vs. ASU at Martin Stadium,
               located at 1775 NE Stadium Way. I was positioned on the
               sideline of the field in the northwest corner of the end zone
               with Deputy Cox, near the student section. I heard Cougar
               Security Officer Sarah Bergman radio a possible medical call in
               section 32 near the visitor tunnel. Bergman said there appeared
               to be an intoxicated male who had possibly passed out. Deputy
               Cox and I were standing on the field near section 32 so I
               looked over to see if I could locate the individual laying in
               the stands. I could see multiple Crowd Management Services
               (CMS) workers, Bergman, and Cougar Security Officer Anthony
               Harkins. As I approached I saw an older Hispanic male who
               appeared to be really upset. He was pacing in the stands and
               appeared to be yelling something at nearby fans. The male was
               later identified as Jose R. Vasquez (DOB 11-23-81). The area
               near Vasquez was standing was clear as if fans were trying to
               avoid getting near him. I saw Vasquez pick up a tub of popcorn
               from the nearby stands and throw it towards some fans near the
               front of the section. I walked towards Vasquez and asked him
               what was going on, but he did not answer. Instead Vasquez took
               his arm and push me as I approached him. I placed my other hand
               near his chest and he hit it away with his arm. Deputy Cox came
               and grabbed Vasquez's right arm and I grabbed his left arm and
               we pushed him up against the nearby handrails. Vasquez was had
               his muscles tensed up and he was trying to get out of our
               control holds. Intern Alex Elwell arrived and helped hold on to
               Vasquez. I told Vasquez he needed to relax. Deputy then told
               him he needed to stop resisting. I handcuffed Vasquez (double
               locked). Ofc. Westerman and Deputy Anderson arrived on scene.
               Deputy Anderson and Ofc. Westerman assisted me in transporting
               Vasquez to the processing room in Martin Stadium. He was
               resisting walking towards processing as well. As soon as we got
               there Deputy Anderson told Vasquez to have a seat on the bench
               several times. Vasquez kept refusing and demanded we let him

               out of handcuffs. Ofc. Westerman lifted up Vasquez legs and
               assisted him in sitting down on the bench. Vasquez continued to
               be verbally abusive towards all of us and continued to argue
               and yell. Vasquez had blood shot and watery eyes, slurred
               speech, and the strong odor of intoxicants coming from his
               breath. I began to read Vasquez his Constitutional Rights from
               my department issued Miranda Warning Card. Vasquez repeatedly
               said "so I'm going to jail". The only time I was reading them
               and would not acknowledge if he understood them. I read them to
               him two more times, while he continued to speak over me.
               Vasquez kept calling us "gay" repeatedly. Bergman arrived in
               processing, and I went outside to speak with her. I asked her
               what happened. She told me some of the fans called her over
               because Vasquez was sprawled out in the stands. She said
               Vasquez stood up and started flipping off one of the fans. She
               asked him to please calm down and then that's when he throw the
               tub of popcorn. I asked Bergman to write me a written
               statement, I later uploaded it into Spillman. I read Vasquez
               his ejection notice and explained to him he is not to return to
               Martin Stadium or within 300 feet for the remainder of the
               game. I told him if he did, he would be arrested for criminal
               trespass. I told him I would be forwarding charges on him for
               Disorderly Conduct to the Whitman County Prosecuting Attorney's
               Office. Deputy Anderson, Ofc. Westerman, and I escorted Vasquez
               out of the stadium. I went to take of the handcuffs and Vasquez
               continued to squirm and tense up keeping me from being able to
               remove them. As soon as I got one arm out he jerked his other
               arm away from me pulling away with one of the bracelets of
               handcuffs still on his wrist. Ofc. Westerman and Deputy
               Anderson grabbed ahold of him while I removed the other
               bracelet. We cleared the scene. No further action. My Vievu
               camera was activated and the video was later downloaded into
               the permanent digital evidence folder. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of

               Trespassing 2. NARRATIVE: On 11/07/15 at approximately 1615
               hours I was on the 50 yard line at Martin Stadium after the
               completion of the WSU v ASU football game. The only people on
               the field at that time were authorized personnel (Staff Pro,
               Athletics, Event Staff, LEO). I noticed a male subject wearing
               a grey sweatshirt and jeans running around the field. The
               subject caught my attention because I saw Staff Pro and Event
               Staff running after him periodically. I noticed the subject did
               not have any credentials (neck lanyard) on him and he appeared
               to be jumping around and celebrating the win. I began to walk
               towards the subject. I watched as the subject got to the west
               end zone and started jumping around in one of the event staff's
               face. I saw an athletics personnel walk towards him and point
               towards the student section as if telling him to leave. The
               male began to run and the Event's Staff grabbed his shirt, but
               he broke free. The male then ran into another subject who
               grabbed a hold of him. The male subject began to spin to his
               left to break free of his hold, but it was too late, I tackled
               him into the end zone. I handcuffed the subject and walked him
               to the processing room. The subject was identified by WADL as
               Peter Marth. Marth said he was not a student and I ejected him
               from the stadium with a warning for trespassing. While talking
               with Marth I could smell the odor of intoxicants on his breath.

               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 110715
               at approximately 1638 hours I was dispatched to a Burglary in
               the region 5 RV lot near Hawthorne Ct. I responded and met with
               Thomas W. Whittenberg (101168), the victim. He informed me that
               someone had used one of his sway bars that had been left by his
               tongue to smash the window on the forward door of his trailer.
               They then gained entry and stole numerous items. Of note was a
               black compact .45 Kimber that was taken from underneath the bed
               compartment. The firearm was loaded and in a brown leather
               waistband holster. Whittenberg was not concerned about any
               other items stolen other than the gun. What he mentioned being
               stolen was a bottle of Crown Royal, an older IPOD, and a
               Verizon Jetpack. There were no witnesses and Whittenberg did
               not suspect anyone. I checked the Trailer for blood and
               fingerprints. I could not locate any. I provided Whittenberg
               with my business card and his case number. I asked him to email
               me a list of items taken and specifically the serial number and
               model of his handgun. I returned to the station to get supplies
               to protect the trailer from the elements. I returned to the
               trailer and assisted Whittenberg with sealing his window. I
               cleared. I am awaiting Whittenberg's email to enter the firearm
               into NCIC. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 7th day of November, 2015, in Pullman,

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5666 11/07/15 SYNOPSIS: WSU
               Transportation Services employee struck by hit and run vehicle
               at Stadium Way and Cougar Way while manning a traffic closure
               during a WSU Football game. The employee was not injured.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               November 7, 2015 at about 1647 hours I was advised by WSU
               Transportation Services personnel that they had been struck by
               a vehicle earlier in the day while manning a traffic closure at
               the Stadium Way/Cougar Way intersection. The employee struck by
               the vehicle was not injured. Washington State University hosted
               a home football game with Arizona State University. During home
               football games Stadium Way is closed at the intersection of
               Cougar Way. It is also closed at Grimes Way. The closure allows
               pedestrians to use the roadway to ingress/egress from Martin
               Stadium. It also allows the staging of transit buses to move
               the masses of spectators. The road is clearly marked with
               regulatory "Road Closed" signs mounted on type III barricades.
               In addition there are 28 inch orange traffic cones blocking the
               roadway. Both intersections are manned by WSU Transportation
               Services personnel as well as WSU Police Interns. Only
               authorized vehicles can pass through the closure into the
               closed off area. Examples of authorized vehicles are, police,
               fire, ambulances, transit busses, game day shuttle vehicles,
               and public works/Facility Operations vehicles. Some vendors are
               allowed to enter the area if they display the appropriate game
               day parking credentials. Any vehicle exiting the closure is
               allowed to pass without question. Dezma M. Hernandez (07/14/94)
               and Mariah A. Sepulveda Clark (10/07/93) were manning the north
               closure at the Cougar Way intersection. They are both WSU
               students and are employed by WSU Transportation Services. They
               were wearing orange reflective vests. The vests are labeled WSU
               Transportation Services" on the back. There were two (2) type
               III barricades position to the north of the crosswalk. The
               barricades were blocking the two (2) lanes nearest the center
               line. Cones were used to block the inbound (southbound) and
               outbound (northbound) lanes of travel. The cones allow for easy
               movement to allow vehicles in and out of the closure. According
               to Hernandez and Sepulveda Clark an unknown male driving a tan
               F150 was exited the closure. Before exiting the male stopped
               and told the women that he was leaving to get french fries for
               the presidential suite and he was caterer. A quick conversation
               ensued where Hernandez and Sepulveda Clark told the male that
               he would need a permit for reentry. The male only had a "AA"

               parking permit which does not allow entry into the closure.
               Sepulveda Clark told the male that he won't be allowed back in
               with the "AA" permit and will have to use the approved detours
               to the "AA" parking areas. The male said something to the women
               about "Sweet talking" his way back in and they drove away. At
               about 1400 to 1410 hours the male drove up to the closure. He
               was on Stadium Way traveling southbound. Hernandez told me he
               drove around or between the two (2) cones blocking the
               southbound lane. She was standing in the lane of travel facing
               the vehicle and waving her arms for him to stop. She was
               positioned behind the closure. The male continued through the
               closure, around the cones and struck Hernandez with the front
               driver's side headlight area of his F150. She compared being
               hit by the car to a really hard two (2) handed push. Hernandez
               went up to the male driver to tell him he was not allowed and
               that he hit her. The male kept on driving slowly. His side view
               mirror struck her as he kept driving past her. He told
               Hernandez and Sepulveda Clark that he needed to go because he
               had to deliver fries to the presidential suite and that she can
               report him if she wanted to but he had to go. The male then
               drove away. He did not provide her any contact information or
               identification. Hernandez recorded the license plate of the
               vehicle, N144710/ID. She told a WSU Police Intern what happened
               and gave him the license plate number. WSU Police Officers were
               not called or contacted at the time of incident. Hernandez did
               report the incident to her WSU Transportation Services
               supervisor by telephone at 1410 hours. Hernandez and Sepulveda
               Clark described the male driver as a white male, 40 to 60 years
               of age, white hair and wearing glasses. The vehicle is licensed
               to Happy Day Corporation out of Lewiston, ID. I received the
               following emailed statement from Hernandez. It has been added

               6:24 PM To: Jones, Darren Matthew Subject: Incident at Stadium
               and Cougar Way Hello Officer Jones! My name is Dezma Hernandez
               and I was at the Stadium Way closure today. Mariah was a
               witness to this and I reference her as 392 because that is her
               enforcement officer number at Transportation Services. Here is
               my statement on what happened: A patron was leaving the Stadium
               Way closure northbound and he told Mariah, 392, and I that that
               he would be back because he needed to go get fries for the
               presidential suite and that he was a caterer. We asked him if
               he had a permit, but he only had an AA permit, which was not
               allowed through the closure, so 392 said that he would not be
               allowed back through without the proper permit. The patron went
               on to say that he would try to "sweet talk" us into letting him
               through, then drove away. Between 2:05 PM and 2:10 PM, the
               patron drove in between the cones and barricade that were
               blocking access onto Stadium way. I was standing behind the
               cross walk and waved at him to get him to stop, however he did
               not and his vehicle bumped into me hard enough to push me back.
               I went around his vehicle to tell him that he was not allowed
               and that he hit me with his car, but he kept driving slowly and
               his rear view mirror bumped into my left shoulder. I told the
               patron, "Sir, you just hit me with your car." The patron went

               on telling 392 and myself that he needed to go because he had
               to deliver fries to the presidential suite and it was an
               emergency because they were out of fries. The patron said
               before leaving, "I have to go. You can report me if you want,
               but I need to go." He then drove away and before he got too far
               away I recorded his license plate onto my phone and I let 392
               and the nearby police intern know what happened. The license
               plate I recorded on my phone was: Idaho N 144710 He was a white
               male in between his 40s and 60s, gray hair and eye glasses.
               That is the end of my statement. I also informed Chris Boyan of
               what happened today (11/7/15). Sincerely, Dezma Hernandez #381

               hours I was responding to a call at NE Hawthorne Ct when I was
               flagged down by Jesse J. Halvorson (050476). Halvorson had
               found a pair of bolt cutters. As I was responding to a burglary
               and they could have been involved, I asked him to leave them
               where he found them, under his RV, and I would return in a few
               minutes. I found that my burglary did not involve the use of
               bolt cutters so I returned to Halvorson and took them as found
               property. I cleared. Nothing follows. I certify and declare

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5671 SYNOPSIS: Subject called from
               Arizona stating her friend had texted her about committing
               suicide. Subject was contacted and determined not to be a
               threat to himself. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               Kenton J. Surawski 10/07/96 Counseling Services 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 11/07/15 at approximately 2115 hours, Ofc. Tiengo was
               dispatched to a welfare check call. Dispatch stated that Kenton
               J. Surawski 10/07/96 had texted the reporting party, Amber C.
               Johnson 09/07/96, that he was going to commit suicide by
               jumping off the roof of his dorm. I looked up Kenton in the WSU
               directory and found that he lived at Stephenson North room
               1229. Sgt. Kuhrt and I responded to Stephenson North and as I
               pulled into the loading dock area I noticed a male talking on
               his cell phone in the parking lot. Wondering if the male was
               Kenton I walked up to him and asked him for his first name. The
               male identified himself as Kenton. I asked Kenton if we could
               talk and we both sat down on a retaining wall near by. I told
               Kenton that I one of his friends had called me about some text
               messages he had sent and I was wondering what was going on.
               Kenton stated that he had been texting one of his friends who
               lives in Arizona where he is originally from. Kenton said he
               had believed that him and Amber were in a dating relationship
               but Amber told him they were not. Kenton stated that in "the
               heat of the moment" he told Amber that he was going to kill
               himself. I asked Kenton if he wanted to harm himself and he
               said no. Kenton went on to say that as soon as he texted Amber,
               he instantly regretted it. Kenton said he has been talking to
               one of his friends on his cell phone about the issue. Kenton
               said he was just upset at the situation and is doing better
               now. It was currently Dad's Weekend and I asked Kenton if his
               father was in town. Kenton said yes but he is staying in a
               hotel in Lewiston, ID. I asked Kenton if he had spoken to his
               Father about his depression and Kenton said he had. I again
               asked Kenton if he was feeling like harming or attempting to
               kill himself and Kenton said no. During my entire contact with
               Kenton he was level headed and in control of his emotions. I
               did not believe that Kenton was going to harm himself. I
               provided Kenton with my business card and told him was was
               available as a resource if he ever needed it. Sgt. Kuhrt and I
               cleared. I asked Ofc. Tiengo if he had already contacted Amber
               and he had not. I called Amber who said as long as she has
               known Kenton he has made statements to her about killing
               himself. Amber became more conserned tonight because she flat

               out asked Kenton if he was going to kill himself and he said
               yes. I explained my contacted with Kenton to Amber and she told
               me he was lying. I told Amber that at minimum this case would
               be referred to WSU counseling services and Kenton would have a
               chance to talk to someone there. I told Amber to contact me
               again if Kenton made anymore similar statements. Amber emailed
               me several screen shots of Kenton's and Amber's text
               conversation. The screen shots were uploaded to the files
               folder. The text conversation between Kenton and Amber is full
               of manipulation by Kenton to get Amber to feel sorry for
               Kenton. It appears that Kenton was trying just about anything
               to make Amber feel bad. This case will be referred to WSU
               Counseling Services. END OF REPORT I certify and declare under

               CASE #: 15-W5672 SYNOPSIS: Juvenile subject was contacted for

               Johnston/080499 Warned MIP Exhibiting 2. NARRATIVE: On 11/08/15
               at about 0032 hrs I was driving westbound on Cougar Way passing
               D St. when I noticed three males walking eastbound on Cougar
               Way near the Lower Soccer Field. They caught my attention
               because one of the males, later identified as George W.
               Johnston (080499), was stumbling side to side as he walked.
               Johnston's head also bounced from side to side like a bobble
               head as he walked. Johnston appeared to be under 21. I stopped
               and contacted Johnston near Global Scholars Hall. The other two
               subjects were not visibly intoxicated so they were not
               identified and advised they could leave. I asked how much he
               had to drink and Johnston said nothing. I asked him to be
               honest with me because he was clearly intoxicated and under the
               age of 21. Johnston told me he was 18. I noticed Johnston's
               pants were unzipped and advised him to zip them up. I asked for
               ID he said he did not have any ID with him. I asked if he was a
               student at WSU and he said yes. I asked where he lived and he
               said "we came here for the weekend". He then said he wasn't a
               WSU student. I asked again how old he was and he said 21. After
               again asking how old he was he said 20. Finally he told me
               again he was 18 and provided me with his name and date of
               birth, which indicated he was 16. At that time he admitted to
               being 16 years old. I confirmed the information he provided
               through Dispatch. Johnston told me his parents were at their RV
               and were aware he was out drinking. I attempted to contact his
               parents on the phone but received no answer. I provided
               Johnston with a transport to his parents RV, which was located
               in the parking lot at the Pullman Presbyterian Church. I
               contacted George's father, Christopher W. Johnston (122270),
               and advised him of the situation. George was turned over to his
               father. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of

               male believed he was at his apartment. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 11/08/15 at approximately 0153
               hours I responded to a report of a male outside of 1401 NE
               Merman Drive, Apartment B208 who was trying to get into the
               apartment. The reporting party, Xiaoyue Chen 04/24/86, stated
               that for the last five minutes someone was trying to open her
               door. Chen said she did not have any roommates and nobody else
               has keys to her apartment. Upon arrival I found a male standing
               at the door of unit B208. The male, later identified as Andre
               David Bergeron 08/13/89, was trying to get his key to open the
               door. I called out to Bergeron and asked what he was doing.
               Bergeron said he was trying to get into his apartment. I asked
               what his apartment number was and he said 108. I told Bergeron
               that he was at 208 and Bergeron disagreed with me. It was clear
               that Bergeron was highly intoxicated and was having difficulty
               standing up straight. I had Bergeron give me his driver's
               license which had the address of 1401 NE Merman Drive apartment
               A108 on it. I told Bergeron that he was at the wrong apartment
               and Bergeron still did not believe me. I walked Bergeron to the
               A building and showed him his apartment. Bergeron finally
               believed me. Bergeron was able to open the door to his
               apartment and I told him to go to sleep and sober up. At no
               point did Bergeron attempt to force his way into apartment
               B208. Ofc. Boyd contacted Chen and explained the situation.
               Both units cleared shortly thereafter. END OF REPORT I certify

               approximately 0155 hours Ofc. Tiengo and I were dispatched to a
               medical call at Community Duncan Dunn. Dispatch advised that
               there was an intoxicated subject in the 3rd floor bathroom that
               didn't live there. The reporting party (hall staff) told
               Whitcom the subject went into room 371. Pullman Fire was en
               route as well. We arrived on scene and went to room 371. I
               knocked on the door and it was answered by a male subject,
               later identified as Timothy A. Frazier Leslie. I saw three
               other male subjects inside the room and they were identified as
               Logan H. Moser 01/17/97, Lucas R. Price 01/12/97, and Andrew H.
               Pitts 12/26/96. I asked the subjects if anyone needed medical
               attention and they all said no, except for Moser, who was
               asleep on the top bunk. I explained that hall staff called
               because they were concerned for the welfare of one of them.
               They all looked confused. I had them wake up Moser and I spoke
               with each of them to make sure everyone was ok, which they
               were. I canceled the medics. All four subjects were intoxicated
               and their speech was slurred. I told the group that they needed
               to get any alcohol from the room and dump it out. Lucas and
               Timothy collected about 24 cans of beer and poured them out in
               the bathroom sink. I told the group it would be sent to student
               conduct. Ofc. Tiengo and I cleared. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 9th day of
               November, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

    Narrative: RVWD:Boyd/335 OFC: BRW/325 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5678 SYNOPSIS: Male who was out for a
               jog witnessed a suspicious encounter between a male and female.
               The jogger believed the male and female were having a verbal
               argument. I was unable to locate the couple. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 11/08/15 at
               approximately 0204 hours Ofc. Umbright radioed that he was out
               with a male who may have witnessed something near Stevens Hall.
               I responded to Ofc. Umbright who was on Thatuna near Linden St.
               Ofc. Umbright was speaking to Denton Joseph Donahou 09/24/92.
               Donahou provided me with the following story. Donahou was out
               for a jog when he noticed a male and female walking near the
               intersection of Campus St and Veterans Way. Donahou said he had
               his headphones in but the two appeared to be arguing as they
               walked. Donahou stopped and took out his headphones but could
               not hear what the two were talking about. Donahou said he just
               got a bad felling about the situation and wanted someone to
               check on the two. I asked Donahou to describe the male and
               female but he was only able to tell me they were both white and
               college aged. Donahou said the female may have been wearing a
               scarf but he was not sure. Donahou went on with his jog and I
               searched the area for the two. I checked the area for several
               minutes but found no males walking with females. Unable to find
               the two college age persons, I cleared. END OF REPORT I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.
