               outside of the building and could not see or hear any signs of
               an alarm. As I was going to enter the building, I saw two WSU
               employees exit the building. I asked if they were working on
               the alarm panel and learned they had. Earl Howard Leland (06-
               15-53) said he was working on the alarm panel and did not
               realize he had activated the Fire Alarm. He said there was no
               fire emergency. I cleared. I certify and declare under penalty

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: JAK/333 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5592 SYNOPSIS: A WSU student was taken
               into Protective Custody at Pullman Regional Hospital for
               wanting to end her life. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR#
               1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 11-05-15, at approximately 1124 hours, I
               was assigned a welfare check. Whitcom advised Abigail L.
               Poelstra (01-08-97) called stating her friend, Gewn Callison
               (06-21-96) said she wanted to die. Poelstra said Callison was
               supposed to have had an appointment with WSU Counseling
               Services on the morning of 11-05-15. Poelstra said she was not
               sure Callison went to this appointment. Poelstra said the last
               time she had seen Callison was at approximately 1030 hours, in
               the area of the WSU Health and Wellness building. I drove
               around the area of the WSU Health and Wellness building and did
               not find Callison. I was on my way to Callison's residence (231
               McCroskey Hall) when Whitcom advised they believed Callison was
               at the WSU Health and Wellness building. I responded to the WSU
               Health and Wellness building and was told she was not check in
               there. I went upstairs and contacted WSU Counseling Services.
               The front desk attendant asked me to follow her back to a
               counselor's office. I was introduced to Jeffrey C. Walsh (06-
               18-97). Walsh is Callison's boy friend. He told me Callison had
               been prescribed Lexipro, but it had given her short term memory
               so she stopped taking it. He said Callison was extremely
               frustrated by this and had been saying things like she wanted
               to kill herself. As Walsh and I were talking he received a
               phone call from Poelstra stating she had Callison with her and
               was taking her to Pullman Regional Hospital. I told Poelstra I
               would meet them at the hospital. Prior to Poelstra and Callison
               arriving at the hospital, Walsh showed me some text messages
               Callison had exchanged with him earlier in the morning. Two of
               the texts from Callison said "I want Mexican, and to Die" and I
               want to fall off of the face of the Earth". Walsh asked if he
               could go to the hospital with me so I gave him a ride. When we
               arrived at the hospital Walsh did not see Poelstra's vehicle. A
               short time later Poelstra arrived with Callison. We entered the
               emergency room and Callison got checked in. After she was
               checked in I asked Callison if I could speak with her. She said
               that was fine. I asked her if she wanted to kill herself and
               she said yes. I asked her if she had a plan and she said she
               planned on taking the remaining Lexipro pills and wash them
               down with alcohol. Callison was taken back into the Emergency
               Room and I went with her and spoke with the nurse who would be
               taking care of her. I told her what I had learned from Callison

               NARRATIVE: On 11/05/15 at approximately 2330 hours Ofc. Tiengo
               and I were walking south through the Magic Forest (Wooded area
               to the southeast of Orton Hall). We noticed three subjects
               walking north from the parking lot towards the basketball
               courts. We noticed the group stopped and one male subject
               started walking east into the forest. We both stopped and
               watched as the subject started looking around suspiciously as
               if looking to see if anyone was watching him. The male then
               walked directly to a group of trees with low hanging branches
               and bent down to the ground. The male subject then turned on
               his cell phone flashlight and looked at the ground. The subject
               then walked off to the south and into the parking lot on the
               south side of the forest. He then walked back to the other two
               males that were standing on the sidewalk by the parking lot.
               The male was wearing a dark jacket and light pants. I noticed
               he had longer blonde hair. After the group left Ofc. Tiengo and
               I walked over to where the subject when and turned on my
               flashlight. I noticed a bag of what I recognized to be
               marijuana in it. There was also a pipe and a lighter. The items
               were undisturbed with no dirt or grass on them. I retrieved the
               items. I went onto Yik Yak (an anonymous social media site) and
               posted that I just found marijuana in the woods. Someone
               commented back that it was their marijuana and they had to
               ditch it because the cops came. Approximately 10 minutes later
               I saw three males walking into the forest towards us. We backed
               up approximately 15 feet behind some trees. The group came back
               to the spot we were at and the same male subject (blonde hair)
               began frantically looking around with his cell phone light. The
               three began to walk off after approximately 3 minutes. Ofc.
               Tiengo and I caught up with them as they exited the forested
               area. Ofc. Tiengo asked if they lost something. I did not hear
               the response. I walked up to the blonde male, identified by
               WADL as Devin J. Sepich. I told Sepich I watched him walk into
               the woods about 10 minutes prior. Sepich said he didn't I told
               him that I watched him do it. Sepich said there are other
               people that look like him. I told him there are no other people
               wearing the same clothes as he is. Sepich said he had walked to
               his friend's car and pointed to another male in the group who
               was only identified as Andrew. Sepich denied being in the woods
               except for when we just talked to him. I asked Andrew to come

               walk with me towards his car. I asked Andrew if he was with
               Sepich earlier when they walked away from his car. Andrew said
               he was. I asked Andrew if someone else was with them to and he
               said there was another male. Andrew said as they were walking
               back Sepich told him he would be right back and walked into the
               woods and then met back up with them. I walked back to Sepich
               and explained that I would be forwarding the case to student
               conduct. Sepich continued to deny that he had anything to do
               with the marijuana and eventually admitted to walking over to
               it, but said he didn't touch it. I told Sepich he was free to
               go. I returned to WSUPD with the items. I NIK tested the
               marijuana and it showed a presumptive positive result for the
               presence of Cannabis Sativa. I logged the items into evidence.

               his hand. I asked if the marijuana in the pipe was the only
               marijuana in the vehicle, he said there was more, and pointed
               out a container in the center console. There was another male
               in the passenger seat. I asked if they had both been smoking
               marijuana and they both said they had. I asked Shank to step
               out of the vehicle and told him to bring the pipe with him. He
               stepped out and I had him place the glass pipe on top of the
               vehicle. I asked Shank if he had identification with him and he
               gave me his Illinois driver's license. I asked if he had any
               previous contact about marijuana he said he had not. I
               explained to Shank I would be forwarding charges for possession
               of marijuana to the Whitman County Prosecutors office and I
               would also be forwarding my report to student conduct. I asked
               Shank if he would grab the marijuana out of the vehicle, he
               said he would. He took a plastic container out of the center
               console of the vehicle, and he set on the roof of the vehicle.
               I placed the glass pipe and the container, which contained
               marijuana, into an evidence bag. I explained the prosecutor and
               student conduct would be contacting him. I told the male from
               the passenger side of the vehicle, Dax Buratto, I was warning
               him and sending my report to student conduct. I returned to the
               office and placed the glass pipe and container with marijuana
               into a locker in the evidence room. On 11/06/15 at about 0415
               hours I photographed and NIK tested the marijuana. The NIK test
               showed presumptive positive for marijuana. I weighed the

               Warned POM NARRATIVE: On 11/06/15 at approximately 0015 hours
               Ofc. Tiengo and I were walking north along the gravel path on
               the west side of the Magic Forest (wooded area to the southeast
               of Orton Hall). We saw three people standing under a street
               lamp. I noticed one of them was smoking something. I could see
               him bring his hand down from his mouth and then saw him exhale
               smoke. The subject was wearing a jacket with red sleeves. When
               the subjects saw us they quickly began walking to the north. As
               we were walking behind them I could not smell anything until
               they got to the parking lot of Orton Hall. At that time I could
               smell the odor of burnt marijuana. I asked for Ofc. Whitman and
               Cpl. Daniels to respond to the area since they were in a car
               nearby. The group walked to the sidewalk on the north side of
               Orton Hall and then turned west. As the group got near the
               access road to go behind Orton Hall, Ofc. Whitman and Cpl.
               Daniels arrived on scene. I walked up to the group and could
               still smell the odor of burnt marijuana. I asked one of the
               subject, later identified by WADL as Jared W. Fravel, to come
               talk with me. I asked Fravel how old he was and he said 18. I
               asked how much marijuana he smoked and he said only one hit. I
               then spoke with another subject, identified as Erik P. Nimb. I
               asked Nimb how much he smoked and he said none. Nimb said that
               it never got to him. I asked Nimb if he had any marijuana on
               him and he said he has a joint, which he removed from his
               pocket and handed to me. I asked Nimb who the marijuana
               belonged to and he said it was his. I asked Nimb if he had
               anything illegal in his backpack. Nimb said he did and removed
               a jar with marijuana inside and handed it to me. I went over to
               the other subject who was being uncooperative with Cpl. Daniels
               and Ofc. Whitman. I could hear him denying that he did anything
               wrong and did not want to identify himself. I walked up to him
               and showed him the items that Nimb just gave me. I told the
               subject I knew he was lying and had been smoking. I told him
               that the other two subjects were being honest and asked if he
               was going to be. The subject pointed at the joint and said he
               was smoking tobacco and that there was tobacco in the joint. I
               asked the subject what else was in the joint and he said
               marijuana. I told the subject to provide Cpl. Daniels with his
               ID as she had requested. The subject removed a Cougar Card

               identifying him as Ethan J. Wulff. While Cpl. Daniels was
               speaking with Wulff I heard her say she could smell alcohol on
               him and he admitted to taking 2 shots. I explained to all three
               that I would be forwarding the case to student conduct. I told
               Wulff to cooperative with the police in the future. I told all
               three they were free to go. I returned to WSUPD with the items.
               I NIK tested the marijuana from the jar and from the joint.
               They both tested presumptive positive for the presence of
               Cannabis Sativa. I entered the items into evidence. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.
