 15-W6087 Accident Hit & Run               Traffic Accident, Hit and Run
        Complainant: BLAIS, MICHELLE M

                           PULLMAN              WA 99163

        Time Reported: 16:35
    Time Occurred between: 15:30:00 11/28/15 - 16:32:27 11/28/15

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: mjp/327 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W6087 SYNOPSIS: Subject's vehicle was hit
               and a note was left with an incomplete phone number. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 112815 at
               approximately 1635 hours I was dispatched to a cold hit and
               run. I responded and met with Michelle M. Blais (071797). She
               showed me the front grill of her VW Jetta had been struck,
               knocking off the emblem and cracking the license plate mount
               ($300). She said a note had been left with a phone number but
               she had not called it. The note stated that the suspect had
               "accidentally" hit her car and that they lived in Perham. The
               phone number was 675-6874 with no area code. Blais called the
               number by adding a 509 and 253 with no success. I took pictures
               of the vehicle and provided Blais with my card and her case
               number. She stated that a smaller Ford pickup had been parked
               in front of her when she had left her vehicle at approximately
               1530 hours. The vehicle would presumably be a Ford Ranger. She
               said it was black but with some blue on the sides. She did not
               have any more specifics. I asked her to contact me if she saw
               the vehicle or got any calls back from the numbers she called.
               I then checked the Beasley Grey lot for any vehicles matching
               the description. WSU Parking had blocked the lot off for WSU
               Basketball. I advised the attendant on duty to call us if he
               saw a vehicle matching the description. I then contacted Nick
               North, the RED for Streit Perham. He apparently had bad cell
               service so I emailed him inquiring about card swipes at the
               main entrance between 1530 and 1630. I am awaiting his
               response. Case pending. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 28th day of November,
               2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               NARRATIVE: On 11/28/15 at approximately 2245 hours Whitcom
               County was dispatched to a third party report of a domestic
               dispute at 5101 SR 270. The reporter stated that a female
               subject was walking eastbound on SR 270 and was being chased by
               someone. I had previously heard Ofc. Harris (PPD) check out
               with a vehicle on SR 270 near MP 5 and was headed that way to
               back him up. WCSO asked if WSUPD could do an agency assist for
               them until they got there. I asked for another WSU unit to
               respond to the residence since I was backing Ofc. Harris. Upon
               my arrival to Ofc. Harris he told me he spoke with the alleged
               victim who was intoxicated and reported to him that nothing
               happened. Ofc. Harris said the subject left in a van with her
               friend. Ofc. Harris and I responded to 5101 SR 270 and spoke
               with Sally Fischer who was in the driveway by the house.
               Fischer seemed intoxicated and told Ofc. Harris nothing
               happened and that her daughter was drunk and she did not want
               her to be at Fischer's mother's house (5101 SR 270), so her
               daughter left. Ofc. Harris said he would be responsible for the
               case. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 29th day of November,

               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 11/27/15
               between 1000-1630 hours Ofc. Kirshner, Ofc. Westerman and I
               worked the Apple Cup at Husky Stadium in Seattle WA. At
               approximately 1430 hours Ofc. Westerman and I were standing at
               the southeast corner of the stadium near a restricted entrance.
               There is a 4 foot tall concrete retaining wall on one side of
               the entrance and a tall retaining wall on the other side. At
               the end of the entrance Staff Pro was manning a barricade
               allowing only authorized personnel through the gates (press,
               athletic staff, band memeber) with proper credentials. I
               watched as a male subject was standing on the north side of the
               4 foot retaining wall. The subject appeared to be watching
               Staff Pro to see if they were paying attention to him. I
               watched as the subject took a few steps back and jumped over
               the retaining wall. He began to walk down the ramp towards the
               entrance to the field. I walked up to him and noticed he did
               not have any credentials hanging from his neck. I grabbed ahold
               of his arm and escorted him back towards the barricades. I
               asked him why he jumped the wall and he said he was trying to
               meet up with one of his friends. He told me that he used to
               work at the stadium. I asked for his WADL and his student ID,
               which he provided. While he was speaking with me I could smell
               the odor of intoxicants on his breath. The subject was
               identified as Akash Ramachandran 09/23/94. I explained to him
               that he was trespassed from the stadium for the remainder of
               the day and that if he returned he would be subject to arrest
               for trespassing. I told him I would send the report to his
               student conduct. Ramachandran left the stadium area. I later
               completed an ejection form and provided it to Lt. Jaross
               (UWPD). Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 29th day of November,

               because her vehicle had a head lamp out. Officer could smell
               the odor of marijuana coming from the vehicle. Driver was under
               the age of 21 and admitted to smoking marijuana a couple hours

               29-15 at approximately 0149 hours I was on patrol heading
               southbound on Stadium Way. I observed a silver, 2002 Hyundai
               Accent (WA Lic. 698ZBX) traveling northbound on Stadium Way
               with the passenger side head lamp out on the vehicle. I turned
               around and activated my emergency lights. The vehicle was
               stopped for the above described violation. The Hyundai came to
               a stop in the parking lot in front of Gannon Hall just off of
               Stadium Way. I contacted the driver of the vehicle, who was
               later identified as Rachael E. Giddens (DOB 08-14-97) by her
               WSU Cougar Card. As soon as Giddens rolled down the driver side
               window, I could smell the odor of marijuana emitting from the
               vehicle. I told Giddens I was audio and video recording, and I
               stopped her because her passenger side head lamp was out. She
               replied that she was sorry, and that she did not know about her
               head lamp. I asked to see Giddens' driver's license, vehicle
               registration, and proof of insurance. Giddens told me she did
               not have her driver's license with her, but she was able to
               provide me with her WSU Cougar Card. She was able to provide me
               with her vehicle registration and proof of insurance. I
               returned to my patrol vehicle and radioed Dispatch to do a
               record's check on Giddens. Dispatch advised her driver's
               license was valid, and she had no warrants. I asked Dispatch if
               she had Spillman local contacts for drugs, and they said no. I
               went back to the driver's side of the vehicle and contacted
               Giddens. I verbally warned her for the head lamp and not having
               her driver's license with her. I then asked Giddens and her
               passenger if there was any marijuana in the vehicle, and they
               said no. I asked if they were smoking marijuana in the vehicle,
               and they said no. I asked Giddens why the vehicle smells like
               marijuana. She told me they went to a friend's house, and I
               asked if they were smoking there. Giddens told me she had
               smoked, but the passenger said she had not. Giddens told me she
               had smoked a couple of hours ago. I again asked Giddens if
               there was any marijuana in the car, and she said "no there is
               not". I asked Giddens why she was driving if she had been

               smoking marijuana, but her passenger had not been smoking.
               Giddens said she does not like other people driving her
               vehicle. When I asked Giddens how much she had to smoke, she
               said "a couple of hits". I asked Giddens if she would be
               willing to take some voluntary field sobriety tests, and she
               said no. Her passenger asked Giddens why she did not want to
               take them, and she just said she did not want to. Both Giddens
               and her passenger told me they live in Gannon Hall. Her
               passenger mentioned she just wanted to get back to her dorm,
               and I told her she was free to leave. Her passenger thanked me
               and exited the vehicle. I told Giddens I would not be arresting
               her tonight, but she would be sent to WSU Student Conduct. I
               asked her if she had a medical marijuana card, and she said no.
               I told her she was under the age of 21 and should not be
               smoking marijuana in the first place let alone driving a
               vehicle after smoking. I told Giddens if her passenger really
               had not smoked marijuana she should have let her drive the
               vehicle, and she said she understood. Giddens apologized and
               said what she did was irresponsible. I handed her back her WSU
               Cougar Card and vehicle registration. I asked her if I may park
               her vehicle for her, and she said yes. I parked her vehicle in
               a nearby parking spot. I cleared the scene. No further action.
               My Vievu camera was activated, and the video was later
               downloaded into the permanent digital evidence folder. I

               animal ICU room #1604. Ofc. Olmstead and I arrived on scene. We
               went to ICU room #1604 and there did not appear anyone inside
               needed assistance. We contacted Alex B. Stone (DOB 03-22-89)
               inside of the room along with his other coworkers. They all
               advised there was no emergency, and they unsure why the alarm
               keeps going off. There was an audible alarm sounding in the
               lobby. I asked Dispatch to have WSU Facilities Operations to
               respond to reset the alarm. We cleared the scene. No further
               action. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 29th day of November, 2015, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer
