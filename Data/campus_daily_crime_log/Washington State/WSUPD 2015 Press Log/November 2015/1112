               NARRATIVE: On November 12, 2015 at about 1340 hours I was
               contacted by Eric Slocum, WSU Heavy Equipment Supervisor
               regarding a stolen street sign. Slocum said the signs marking
               the intersection of Cougar Way and Stadium Way are missing. The
               bracket that held the signs is missing as well. The post to
               which the bracket was attached is still in place and not
               damaged. The signs were located on the southwest corner of the
               intersection. The signs are "Cougar Way" and "Stadium Way".
               They are crimson in color with grey lettering. Slocum estimates
               the total loss is $800.00. There is not an exact date when the
               signs were taken. It is estimated that they were taken between
               September 28, 2015 and October 5, 2015. There are no security
               cameras in that area of campus. A police report was needed for
               replacement purposes. There are no suspects, witnesses, or
               leads at this time. No further investigation. I certify and

               (03/27/82) NARRATIVE: On 11/12/15 around 1609 hrs I was
               dispatched to a report of a female who walked into the side of
               a moving Pullman Transit bus (Wa. 41702D) on Stadium Way near
               Gannon/Goldsworthy Hall. I was also told the female, who was
               described as an international student left the scene and was
               not present. I responded a short time later and upon my arrival
               spoke with the driver, later identified as Jackson R Melendez
               (01/22/93), who told me the following. Melendez explained he
               had been driving the bus South on Stadium Way after leaving the
               bus stop located at Stadium Way near Troy Ln. As he continued
               South he noticed a female walking down the stairs of Neill Hall
               towards the crosswalk headed towards Gannon Hall. Melendez
               continued and pulled the bus over towards the centerline as he
               began to pass the crosswalk. At this point I asked him about
               the female and she was described as asian, short in stature.
               She had her head down and was wearing headphones as she was
               walking and did not look up before she approached the roadway
               and eventually entering it. Melendez pulled to the left as the
               female bounced off the side of the bus and back onto the
               sidewalk where she fell down. Melendez stopped the bus and had
               to catch up to the female, who was walking away at the time.
               Upon reaching her he was told she was fine and uninjured. He
               went on to say his impression was she was embarrassed and just
               wanted to leave. He told me he needed to contact the police to
               report the incident and upon returning to the bus the female
               left. As we continued to speak he told me two other
               individuals, later identified as Micah S Selk (11/25/95) and
               Najindeen A Adewuyi (03/27/82) had both seen what had happened,
               and provided a written statement. I later scanned the statement
               and added it to this case. I collected their information and
               asked his supervisor who was on scene for a copy of the video
               from the bus. He told me he would get it for me and after
               speaking with Melendez cleared and returned to the WSU Police
               Department where I later spoke with both individuals. Upon
               speaking with Selk I was told he had seen the whole situation
               occur. He went on to describe the events as Melendez had

               described them to me. I asked him about the female and was told
               she hadn't even looked up, and was wearing headphones, before
               entering the roadway and bouncing off the side of the bus and
               falling down. I thanked him for his help and contacted Adewuyi.
               Adewuyi told me he had not seen the female, but had heard her
               strike the side of the bus. He told me he stepped out of the
               bus and went over to speak with her. The female said she was
               completely fine and she needed to go. She reiterated she was
               not injured, but looked embarrassed before walked away. I
               thanked him for his time and we concluded our conversation a
               short time later. I will add the video from the bus upon its
               receipt and recommend this case be closed until such time as
               the female comes forward. Nothing further. I certify and

               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               putting the dog in the trash, leaving him in the forest, or
               leaving him in the road. I asked if she had a description of
               the dog, and she said it was a one year old, male husky. Watson
               told me the OP posted his address in the comment thread. He
               said he lives in the Chinook Village Apartments, building "M".
               The OP also typed "second floor right door, Jake". Watson
               mentioned the OP said someone needed to come pick up the dog or
               else he was going to throw it away in the trash. Watson said
               she decided she was going to go pick up the dog herself, so she
               got in her vehicle and headed over to his apartment. She
               mentioned she got about halfway there, and she saw the post had
               been deleted. Watson decided it was probably not a good idea to
               go to the strangers apartment alone, so she decided to call the
               police. Watson told me she took a screen shot of the
               individuals post about his address. Watson later emailed me the
               screen shot, and I uploaded it into Spillman. I went to Chinook
               Village Apartments, building "M". There are no second levels of
               apartments in the buildings in Chinook Village. I went to the
               apartment M62, located on the far right side of the apartment
               building. I knocked on the door, and a couple males answered. I
               asked them if they knew why I was there, and they said no. I
               mentioned a Yik Yak post referring a dog, and they still seemed
               to not know what I was talking about. I asked if anyone lived

               there by the name of "Jake", and they told me a Jacob lives
               there. Jacob R. Streicher (DOB 02-25-96) came to the door. I
               asked him if he goes by "Jake" at all, and he said only the two
               friends with him really call him by that name. I asked his
               friends if they posted it as a prank, and they assured me they
               did not. I asked him about the dog, and he told me he does not
               have a dog. I asked him if he knows if any of his neighbors own
               a husky dog, and he said he has never seen one or heard one
               barking. I cleared the scene. I later called Watson to tell her
               there did not appear to be any dog in danger, and someone
               posted it as a prank. No further action. My Vievu camera was
               activated, and the video was later downloaded into the
               permanent digital evidence folder. I certify and declare under

               NARRATIVE: On 11-12-15 at approximately 2247 hours, I was on
               patrol when I observed a subject sitting in a vehicle on the
               side of Forest Way. The vehicle had it's interior lights on and
               the subject was leaning down towards the dashboard. As I drove
               passed the vehicle, the subject sat up and looked at us. I
               could see he appeared nervous and wide eyed as we went by. I
               turned around and as I drove by again, he was again bent down
               by the dashboard. At this point I was concerned he was removing
               a stereo as we have had some recent vehicle prowls in the area.
               I pulled up behind the vehicle and the male immediately turned
               off the interior lights. I walked up to the vehicle and the
               male rolled down the window. I asked him what he was doing and
               he stated he was setting up his phone as he was looking for
               directions to somewhere. I could see his eyes were extremely
               bloodshot. I asked where he was going and he didn't answer.
               Ofc. Whitman who was with me, advised me there was a large bong
               between the male's feet. I asked him how old he was and he told
               me he was twenty one. I asked him if he had marijuana in the
               car and he said yes. I asked him how much and he said he didn't
               know. I told him to guess and he said about two grams. I asked
               him if he would show it to me and he said no. I asked him for
               his driver's license and he was identified as Michael Snyder.
               Michael was very nervous during the conversation and I could
               see him shaking. I could also see his carotid artery pulsing in
               his neck. I asked Michael if he was a medical marijuana patient
               and he said no. I asked him if he was aware he was not allowed
               to have marijuana on campus and he said no. I could see in the
               passenger seat a large cylindrical container with a plastic bag
               in it. It appeared the bag was a quart size or larger bag with
               gvm inside. I advised Michael I could tell he had been smoking
               the marijuana and advised him that if he drove tonight he would
               subject to arrest for DUI. He stated he understood. I advised
               him I would be forwarding his information to Student Conduct
               and he stated he understood. We cleared. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of

               NARRATIVE: On 11/12/15 at about 2322 hours RED Britteny Alspach
               detected the odor of marijuana coming from room 839 at Rogers
               Hall, Pullman, WA. She contacted Whitcom and I was dispatched
               to the call. I asked dispatch if there was prior contact at
               this room for marijuana. Dispatch advised there was contact for
               marijuana at the room on November 1st of 2015 and September
               29th of 2015. I checked both of these reports and in both the
               odor of marijuana was confirmed. I called and spoke with
               Alspach on the phone. I asked on a scale from one to ten, ten
               being the most positive, how positive she was that the odor was
               marijuana, she said ten. I asked on the same scale how sure she
               was it was coming from room 839, she said ten. I asked her
               experience with the detection of marijuana. Alspach said she
               has 7 years' experience working at residence halls. She also
               said she has been trained in the detection of marijuana and her
               last training was in August of 2015. On 11/13/15 at about 0017
               hours I called Whitman County District Judge Douglas B.
               Robinson. I forgot to start my digital recorded and began the
               process with the Judge. Once I realized I had not started the
               recording we began again. I was sworn in and I read the
               affidavit for search warrant and the search warrant. Judge
               Robinson asked if the residents were under twenty one, I looked
               at the previous cases and determined they were both under 21.
               He also asked if the had medical marijuana cards, they did not
               stated they did in the previous cases. Judge Robinson granted
               the warrant (#SW111315A). On 11/13/15 at about 0047 hours
               Corporal Kuhrt, Officer Tiengo and I arrived at Rogers Hall. We
               went to room 839 of Rogers Hall, and I knocked on the door. I
               knocked a second time and announced it was the WSU Police and
               we had a search warrant. I knocked again, no one answered the
               door. Corporal Kuhrt attempted to key into the room but he had
               the wrong keys. RED Alspach retrieved keys for the room and I
               used those keys to key into room 839. Officer Tiengo and I
               entered the room and found no one inside. We exited the room
               and I read the warrant at 0059 hours. Corporal Kuhrt, Officer
               Tiengo and I searched the room. In the southeast desk Corporal

               Kuhrt found a jar containing a baggy with green vegetable
               material(later NIK tested presumptive positive for marijuana).
               He also found a glass pipe with marijuana residue inside in the
               desk on the southeast side. Corporal Kuhrt found indicia of
               residency for Morgan G. Mannon in the desk on the southeast
               side of the room. I found two bottles of alcohol in the desk on
               the southwest side of the room. The bottle of whiskey contained
               about 1 ounce of alcohol and the vodka bottle had about a half
               of an ounce in it. I also found indicia of residency in the
               desk on the southwest side of the room for Jonathan W. White.
               Officer Tiengo placed a copy of the warrant on both desks and a
               copy of the items seized on the southeast desk. The room was
               secured and all units cleared the scene. I returned to the
               police department. I photographed the alcohol bottles and
               Corporal Kuhrt observed me dump out the alcohol and dispose of
               the bottles. I completed the return of service and sent it to
               Whitman County District Court. I photographed and processed the
               evidence. I NIK tested the green vegetable material and it was
               presumptive positive for marijuana. There was 3.36 grams of
               marijuana in the baggy that was in the container. Charges
               forwarded to the Whitman County Prosecutor for possession of
               marijuana under forty grams for Mannon, and minor in possession
               of alcohol for White. Nothing further. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of

               NARRATIVE: On 11/12/15 at approximately 2339 hours I was
               driving westbound on Colorado St and came to a stop at the
               intersection of Colorado and B St. I noticed a male, later
               identified as Cole Trevor Furukawa 07/03/97 walking eastbound
               on Colorado towards me. Cole appeared to be having difficulty
               while walking and was grabbing onto a railing to aid his
               balance. Cole turned right onto B St. I also turned onto B St
               and parked in the Community Duncan Dunn parking lot. I watched
               Cole for a minute while he was walking. Cole was stumbling
               forwards and backwards while walking. Cole was having so much
               difficulty walking that he stumbled off the sidewalk and into a
               dirt planter area next to Pi Beta Phi Sorority. As Cole walked
               near me I noticed he appeared to be under the age of 21. Cole
               continued to walk on B St until he crossed Campus St and was
               walking near Honors Hall. I parked on Spokane Street and walked
               up to Cole. I asked Cole if he had a second to talk and he
               stopped. I asked Cole where he was walking to and Cole said
               Stephenson. I asked Cole if he had his ID with him and Cole
               pulled out his wallet. Cole handed me his WSU Cougar Card and I
               asked him if he had his driver's license. Cole said no but I
               could see a state issued ID inside his wallet he was holding. I
               asked about the ID I saw Cole handed it to me. The information
               on the California Driver's License was "Kyle Walter Furukawa
               02/03/94." Cole said it was his brother's ID. About this time
               Ofc. Tiengo arrived on scene. I asked Cole how old he was and
               Cole said he was 18. Cole provided his date of birth to me
               verbally. I explained to Cole what I had observed and asked him
               how much he had to drink tonight. Cole said, "I've had two tall
               boys [beer] and one cup of jungle juice [mixed alcohol]. I
               asked Cole if I could look at his eyes and he said I could. I
               told Cole to stand with his heels and toes together while
               keeping his arms at his sides. I told Cole to follow the tip of
               my pen with his eyes only while keeping his head still. During
               the test I observed, equal pupil size, equal tracking, lack of
               smooth pursuit, and distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum
               deviation in both eyes. During the test Cole was swaying in all
               directions. I could clearly smell the overpowering odor of
               intoxicants coming from Cole's breath as he stood before me. I
               asked Cole if he was willing to provide a voluntary PBT sample

               and Cole said he would. I found my PBT (Alco-Sensor FST #16805)
               in working condition. Cole provided a PBT sample of .160. I
               told Cole that he was under arrest for MIP Exhibiting and
               handcuffed (D/L) him. I advised Cole that he was being audio
               and video recorded and read him his Miranda Rights off my
               department issued card. Cole stated he understood his rights. I
               told Cole that I would be forwarding charges of MIP Exhibiting
               to the Prosecutor and explained the process. I told Cole that
               he was not allowed to possess another person's ID. I explained
               in my experience, people who have older sibling's ID cards that
               would make them 21 years old, are doing so to buy alcohol by
               pretending to be them. Cole said he just forgot to give his
               brother back his ID who lives in California. Due to Cole's high
               intoxication level, I did not believe that Cole could safely
               walk the rest of the way to Stephenson Hall. Ofc. Tiengo drove
               Cole to Stephenson Hall and released him from custody. The
               California driver's license with the name Kyle Furukawa was
               later destroyed. END OF REPORT I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 13th day of
               November, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               0000 hours, I was clearing backing another Officer's traffic
               stop when I noticed a black Ford Focus passing me. As the Focus
               passed me I noticed the tabs displayed 09/2015. I initiated a
               traffic stop and the Focus pulled into the Grove Apartment
               parking lot. I contacted the driver, Saul Ignasio Rios-Vaudrin
               11/29/93, identified myself, informed Saul I was recording, and
               explained the reason for the stop. Saul said he had forgot to
               renew his tabs. Saul provided me with his WADL and vehicle
               registration. I saw that Saul's car was equip with an ignition
               interlock and he demonstrated it was working. I returned to my

               was suspended in the 3rd degree through Washington. Dispatch
               also stated Saul had an ignition interlock requirement. I
               filled out a Sector citation for DWLS 3rd degree and returned
               to Saul. I explained that his license was suspended and the
               reason for suspension. I explained the citation to Saul,
               provided him with his copy, and cleared. END OF REPORT I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 13th day of November, 2015, in Pullman,
