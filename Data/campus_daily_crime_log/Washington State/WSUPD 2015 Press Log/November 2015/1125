        Incident Address : 925 NE North Fairway Rd; Beasley Coliseu
                           PULLMAN              WA 99163

        Time Reported: 09:42
    Time Occurred between: 09:42:50 11/25/15 - 09:42:50 11/25/15

    Narrative: RVWD: AE/330 OFC: DMJ/338 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W6065 11/25/15 SYNOPSIS: Burglary alarm
               at Beasley Coliseum, no emergency. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On November 25, 2015 at about
               0942 hours WSU Police were toned out to a burglary alarm at
               Beasley Coliseum room 104. Cpl. Edwards and I responded to the
               building. As we arrived Whitcom advised that staff from Beasley
               had called about the alarm and were on scene. We made contact
               with Tollett, Lisa J. (10/19/78). She said she put in her code
               but the alarm continued to make noises. Tollett had the doors
               to 102 and 104B both open. She eventually was able to silence
               and reset the alarm. The panel continued to make noise as it
               displayed a "low battery" alarm. I contacted WSU Facilities
               Operations by telephone to request Life Safety personnel
               respond to repair the alarm. There was no emergency, just an
               employee error. No further investigation. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               25th day of November, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

    Narrative: RVWD:MJG/309 / OFC: ENW/328 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W6072 SYNOPSIS: Request for assistance in
               retrieving a wallet from Ferdinand's. Assistance was provided.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               11/25/15 around 1859 hrs I was dispatched to a request for
               assistance in recovering a wallet from Ferdinand's. I contacted
               the reporting party, later identified as Kristi P Kozney
               (01/15/76), and was told the following. Kozney explained she
               had been in Ferdinand's earlier in the day and had left her
               wallet in the bathroom before leaving. She later realized the
               business was closed and asked for assistance in trying to
               retrieve it since she was flying home on 11/27/15. I went to
               Ferdinand's and upon my arrival I checked the bathroom area and
               was unable to locate the wallet. After a brief conversation
               with Asst Chief Hansen I entered the business and was not able
               to locate the wallet or a lost and found near the front counter
               area. While in the establishment I located a phone number for
               John F Haugen (06/14/70), whom I contacted and confirmed was on
               the responsible list. After explaining the circumstances of
               this case Haugen agreed to drive in and check the safe which is
               also where they store items after closing. I met Haugen and
               upon opening the safe he handed me a black wallet which
               contained Kozney's Colorado Drivers License. I took possession
               of the wallet, thanking Haugen before we both cleared, and
               contacted Kozney. Upon reaching Kozney I arranged to meet her
               at the Holiday Inn Express where I returned her wallet and
               cleared without incident. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               26th day of November, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               hours we were toned out to a possible Domestic Dispute in
               progress, there was apparently a language barrier. While en
               route we were informed of a child with a fever. Ofc. Welter and
               I responded to apt 507 at Terrace Apartments. I was familiar
               with the location and knew we had had medical issues there
               previously. We were welcomed into the apartment where Ameen
               Alssalem appeared to be in some respiratory distress. His
               father, Mohamed A. Alssalem (010172), told us that Ameen had
               been fine but his older sister had recently been diagnosed with
               strep throat. Ameen had been breastfeeding and then may have
               had a seizure. They had then given him ibuprofen. Medics
               arrived and I relayed the information. We cleared. Nothing

               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
