        Time Reported: 08:39
    Time Occurred between: 08:38:26 11/27/15 - 08:38:26 11/27/15

    Narrative: RVWD: AE/330 OFC: Olmstead/339 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY
               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W6079 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched
               to a report of an animal problem. The situation was resolved.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 11-22-
               2015 Sergeant Daniels requested that I contact someone
               identified only as "Marissa Bernhofer" at 910-375-5990
               regarding a report of a dog in a classroom. At 1435 hrs I
               attempted to call the number, but no one answered and the voice
               mail system was not set up. I sent a text message with
               instructions for Bernhofer to contact me but never received a
               response. I returned to work on 11-27-2015 and saw that
               Lieutenant Larsen had forwarded two email messages to me which
               had been sent from Bernhofer (marissabernhofer@gmail.com) and
               were received at the general police department email account.
               Bernhofer inquired in her email messages why the police
               department had not done anything about the dog and threatened
               to kick the dog across the room. I reviewed Bernhofer's email
               messages and saw that no information had been provided about
               what class she was referring to, nor was there any information
               about when the class meets or a description of the person who
               is bringing the dog into the classroom. At 0829 hrs I replied
               to Bernhofer's email messages and provided her with my contact
               information. I asked Bernhofer to contact me so I could speak
               with her directly and obtain more information about the dog
               problem. I informed Bernhofer that kicking the dog would be
               inappropriate and warned her not to do this. At 0847 hrs I
               received an email message from Bernhofer. The message stated
               that because the police department did not respond in a "timely
               manner", she had already spoken with the student about the dog
               and resolved the issue. Bernhofer stated in her message that
               she did not want to speak with me. My email correspondence with
               Bernhofer has been saved and attached to this case. No further
               action at this time. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this __27__ day

               2015 at about 1132 hours WSU Police were toned out to a panic
               alarm at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital room 1604. Officer
               Olmstead and I responded to the building. We contacted hospital
               staff working in the room. There was no emergency and they were
               not aware of a panic alarm in the room. We checked the room and
               area. No emergency was found. This same alarm went off earlier
               in the morning. I called WSU Facilities Operations to evaluate
               and make necessary repairs to the alarm. Hospital staff did not
               have any knowledge about how to reset or disable the alarm. No
               further investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 27th day of November,

               4th/DV (07/07/00) **JUVENILE** 2. NARRATIVE: On November 27,
               2015 at about 1332 hours Pullman Police was dispatched to a
               disorderly at 945 SW City View. Pullman Police asked for an
               agency assist as all units were responding to a motor vehicle
               collision. Officer Olmstead and I responded to 945 SW City
               View. We contacted the complainant, Michelle R. Brown
               (08/26/69) in the driveway. She was visibly upset. Michelle
               told us her daughters Nancy and Ashley had been arguing with
               each other. Nancy R. Brown (07/07/00) is 15 years old and lives
               at this address with Michelle. Ashley M. Brown (02/16/90) is 25
               years old. Ashley lives in Spokane, WA. She is just visiting
               her family for the Thanksgiving Holiday. According to Michelle,
               Nancy and Ashley were verbally arguing with each other.
               Michelle told Whitcom that Nancy had assaulted Ashley. Michelle
               went on to tell us that she has multiple personality disorder,
               Nancy has ADD and Ashley has PTSD. Michelle said Ashley went
               into a panic attack. Ashley laid down on the floor yelling and
               screaming. Michelle tried to comfort her. Ashley became more
               upset and locked herself in the bathroom. Michelle doesn't know
               what to do. She said Ashley wont listen to her and wants
               someone from the outside to talk with Ashley. Michelle did not
               want Ashley removed from the house. Michelle gave us permission
               to go inside the house. Her ex husband, Guy was in the home
               along with Nancy and a couple of other family friends. Michelle
               took us to a bedroom on the second floor where Ashley had
               locked herself in the bathroom. I talked with Ashley through
               the door for some time. Eventually she opened the door. Ashley
               was crying and yelling. She said she was not hurt and did not
               need any help. Ashley wanted to stay in the home for the rest
               of the holiday weekend. She said she just "needed some space."
               Ashley went on to say that she didn't want contact from "that
               sperm donor." I had to clarify who she was talking about. It
               was Guy, her father. Ashley told me she has PTSD and it is
               common knowledge that people with PTSD don't want to be
               touched. Ashley did not appear to be injured or in need of
               medical care. The face to face conversation was quick and ended
               with Ashley staying in the bathroom with the door closed.
               Officer Olmstead and I talked with Nancy at a table in the
               dining/living room. An unidentified adult female friend, an
               unidentified juvenile friend and her mother Michelle were all

               present. They were sitting around the table coloring. Nancy
               wanted her sister Ashley out of her bedroom. The two began
               arguing, calling each other names and cursing. At some point
               Nancy slapped Ashley on the face. Nancy admitted to slapping
               Ashley and said she didn't slap her hard. Nancy really didn't
               seem to care that we were talking to her. She ignored us
               coloring, or talking about the music that was on in the
               background. She was not focused. At one point she remembered
               she had not taken her medication and wanted to go take it. I
               recontacted Ashley in the bathroom. I talked to her through a
               closed door. I asked her if she wanted to press charges against
               her sister for slapping her. Ashley replied "No, that's why I
               didn't fucking say anything in the first place." Officer
               Olmstead and I counseled Nancy on the consequences of physical
               violence against family members or anyone else. The family
               friend told her she needed to control herself better and leave
               the situations. We also told her to walk away from situations
               if she finds herself getting mad. Nancy continued to color.
               Michelle had calmed down and decided she was going to give
               Ashley some space by leaving the house to run some errands.
               Just before we left a male appeared from the basement who I
               assume was Guy, the father. We talked with him for a few
               minutes as he asked what was happening. I told him Ashley was
               planning on staying for the remainder of the weekend. Everyone
               had calmed down prior to us leaving. Just before we left
               Michelle wanted to talk about a nuisance neighbor who reports
               her family for parking violations. I told her to contact
               Pullman Police Parking/Code Enforcement on Monday to discuss
               parking issues. Due to Nancy being a 15 year old juvenile and
               her sister not wanting to press charges the case will be sent
               to Whitman County Prosecutor, Juvenile Services, and CPS. None
               of the persons contacted have any affiliation with WSU. No
               further investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 27th day of November,
               2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               NARRATIVE: On 11/27/15 around 1807 hrs I was dispatched to a
               request for a welfare check on an individual, later identified
               as Erika R Tabayoyong (11/14/94). I contacted the complainant,
               later identified as Annabelle R Tabayoyong (03/27/64) and told
               the following. Annabelle explained her daughter, Erika, is a
               student at Washington State University and was remaining on
               campus over the holiday break. She went on to tell me she
               usually speaks with her once a day but has not heard from her
               in the last two days. I asked if Erika was having any
               difficulties or medical conditions and was told she did not. As
               we continued to speak I told her I would try and contact Erika
               and ask her to contact her. She thanked me and I told her I
               would contact her if I located her or not and we ended our
               conversation a short time later. I drove to Orton Hall and upon
               reaching room 729 noticed the light was on inside of the room,
               but could not hear any movement from inside. I knocked on the
               door, which was answered by a female who was currently speaking
               on the phone. I confirmed it was Erika and she told me she was
               currently speaking with her mother and thanked me. I told her
               to let her mother know I had contacted her and she told me she
               would before I cleared. Upon my return to the WSU Police
               Department I contacted Annabelle and confirmed she had spoken
               with Erika. She told me she had and thanked me for the help
               before concluding our conversation. Nothing further. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
