               with a deceased battery. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR#
               1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 11/29/15 at approximately 2148 hours I was
               dispatched to assist a subject with a dead battery parked on
               Wilson out front of Lighty. I responded and meet with Deeq
               Hassan. After removing the ice from the hood of his car we were
               able to access the engine compartment. Although I am not a
               mechanic I was able to determine there was no battery. There
               was however a metal box with large wires coming off of it that
               looked like a battery. Hassan said he thought the battery might
               be in the trunk, so he opened his trunk. There was a plethora
               of items in his trunk compartment, so it became a three man job
               to remove the floor panel, only to access a spare tire. I asked
               Hassan to get his owner's manual and see how to jump start the
               car. Hassan searched for the manual, but to no avail. Being the
               tech savvy person I am, I decided to google "2011 Prius
               jumpstart". I found a 23 step process to jump start the
               vehicle. We first attempted to connect the positive cable of
               the jump pack to a positive terminal on the fuse box. I
               connected the negative cable to the hood latch. Hassan
               attempted to start his car, but nothing happened. I continued
               through the 23 step process and it indicated the battery was in
               the trunk. Hassan and his companions again rummaged through the
               trunk area and found the battery safely nestled in a
               compartment on the passenger side of the vehicle. I connected
               the cables to the appropriate terminals and voila, the car
               started. Lesson learned, nothing further. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
