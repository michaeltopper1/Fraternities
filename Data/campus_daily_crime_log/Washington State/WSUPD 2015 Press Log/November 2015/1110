               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5718 SYNOPSIS: Parent called requesting
               a welfare check on their son. He was determined to be fine and
               had already called home. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR#
               1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 11-10-15 at about 0917 hours I was
               dispatched to the report of a welfare check. Whitcom advised
               that Michael Martin-Tellis was requesting a welfare check on
               his son, Andrew Dodge. Michael advised that he had not talked
               to his son since Sunday. He also said that Andrew should
               currently be in class. I checked Andrew's schedule and saw that
               he should be in class until 0950 hours. I went to his dorm room
               at Northside Residence Hall, room 488. I knocked on the door,
               nobody answered. I tried calling Andrew but his phone was off
               and his voicemail was not set up. I called Michael and told him
               what I had done. I told him that I would not be interrupting
               Andrew's class but I would attempt to make contact with him
               again after his class is over. He said that would be fine. He
               said that Andrew drives a 2004 Volkswagon Jetta and it should
               be parked behind Beasley. I told Michael I would look for
               Andrew's car. I went to the Beasley lot and located Andrew's
               car and saw nothing out of the ordinary. I tried calling Andrew
               again at 1005 hours. He answered. I told him why I was calling
               and he said that he had just got off the phone with his mother.
               He said everything was fine. Andrew sounded upbeat and positive
               on the phone. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 10th day of
               November, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5722 SYNOPSIS: Individual reporting he
               lost his Toshiba Laptop. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR#
               1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 11/10/15 at about 1200 hours I called James
               Clark about his stolen Laptop. Clark acted surprise when I
               called asking about his laptop. Clark said he had called the
               department just to inquire if, by chance, someone had turned it
               in as Lost or Found property. Clark said he did not want to
               waist our time because he did not have any of the information
               concerning the Toshiba Laptop, other than it was blue, and he
               does not have any idea where it was lost. Clark said he was
               fairly sure he had it in his blue backpack when he left his
               office on Friday, 11/06/15, at about 1230 hours, but he was not
               positive. When I asked where his office was Clark said it was
               on High Street but he did not know the address. Clark said over
               the next few hours he went to a number of places, on and off
               campus, not knowing when the laptop was lost. Clark said it was
               about 1800 hours when he noticed the laptop was gone. I asked
               him if he thinks it fell out of his backpack or if someone took
               it out of the backpack. Clark then tells me the backpack and
               laptop are missing. I clarified with Clark that he ran around
               to a number of places between 1230 and 1800 hours and does not
               remember when, or when he did not, have his backpack containing
               his laptop. Clark indicated that was correct, and this was why
               he was just wanting to check the lost and founds, and not
               report it as lost or stolen. Clark seem confused, and/or
               hesitant, in providing the information. I informed Clark it was
               a good idea to at least report this kind of thing as lost
               property because if it is turned in to us we have a better
               chance of locating an owner. Clark, again, apologized for
               wasting our time, and reiterated he had not mean to report it
               as lost or stolen, he was just wanting to see if it had been
               turned in as lost property. I asked Clark to contact this
               department if the backpack and/or laptop was found. Clark
               agreed to do so. No further at this time. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               intoxicated male pounding on dorm room doors in Perham Hall.
               Officers responded and checked the welfare of residents. Unable
               to locate the male. Nothing further. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 11/11/15 at about 0245 hours I
               was dispatched to a suspicious call at Perham Hall. There was a
               report of an intoxicated male pounding on doors of the fifth
               floor of Perham Hall and he then left. The male was described
               as a white male wearing red shorts and a long sleeve black tee
               shirt, possibly headed towards Greek row. Officer Boyd and I
               responded to the area and did a quick search of the area around
               Perham Hall. I then went to the fifth floor and talked to the
               RA who had reported the incident, Anissha Sheeh. She said a
               male, who identified himself to witnesses as Keaton Aspell, was
               pounding on the doors to room 534 and 536. Aspell appeared
               intoxicated and was wearing only a towel. One of the witnesses,
               Jessica Conary, gave him a shirt and pair of shorts to wearing
               and told him he could sleep in the lounge. Aspell became
               uncooperative and left the floor through the west exit. Aspell
               would not have been to access any of the other floors. The
               witnesses I talked to from room 534 said they answered the door
               and Aspell realized he was knocking on the wrong door. He then
               went and knocked on the door to 536 and no one answered. Aspell
               told them at some point that the girl he was with had been
               drinking. Sheeh was concerned that the resident of room 536
               Ashley McGee maybe in trouble because Aspell had been knocking
               very hard and McGee did not come to the door. I went to room
               536 and knocked on the door. I knocked several times very hard.
               McGee finally answered the door. She said she was fine and she
               was with Aspell earlier. Aspell's belongings were also in her
               room. I told her she could keep them in her room and we could
               retrieve them later if we found him or he could get them
               tomorrow. I talked to Conary again, she said she would just
               like her clothes back at some point. Conary said she told
               Aspell to leave the clothes at McGee's door when he returned
               them. As I was leaving the fifth floor Conary said she had just
               gone back to her room and looked out the window. She said she
               saw Aspell walking from the bushes back towards Perham Hall.
               Officer Boyd and I searched the area outside of Perham Hall
               again and could not find Aspell. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               11th day of November, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.
