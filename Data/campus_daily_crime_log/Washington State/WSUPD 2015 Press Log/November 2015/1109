               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5708 SYNOPSIS: Responded to Stephenson
               East room 827 for a welfare check. Resident contacted and told
               to call home. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 11-09-15 at about 1424 hours I was dispatched to
               the report of a welfare check. The RP, Britteny Alspach, was
               the RED on duty and was requesting contact in Stephenson East.
               I went to Stephenson East 8th floor and contacted Alspach. She
               told me that a concerned parent had called regarding their son,
               Marco Shifflette. The parent advised that Marco has not been
               feeling well and that they have not been in contact with their
               son for "awhile". Alspach said that she had already tried
               knocking on Marco's door and their was no answer. She was
               advised by her supervisor to key into the room to do a welfare
               check. I stood by while Alspach knocked on the door several
               times and announced "hall staff, open the door". There was no
               answer. She announced "hall staff, I'm keying into your room".
               There was no answer. When Alspach opened the door we observed a
               male laying face down on an elevated bed. We both called out to
               Marco from the doorway. He did not respond. Alspach advised
               that she would be entering his room and he did not respond. I
               could see Marco was breathing. We were unable to wake him up. I
               requested medics respond. Once medics arrived they were able to
               eventually wake Marco up. He appeared confused and said that he
               was just really tired. He said he had been dealing with a rash
               but had no other medical problems. He refused further medical
               treatment. I told Marco he should call his mother because she
               was very worried about him. He said he would. Nothing further.
               I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws
               of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 9th day of November, 2015, in Pullman,
