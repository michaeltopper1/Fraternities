               Booked WCSO Jail Assault 2nd DV Residential Burg DV Mal Misch
               3rd DV 2. NARRATIVE: On 11-17-15 at approximately 1713 hours, I
               was advised of a domestic which had occurred possbily 30
               minutes ago. The female was stating she had injuries and was
               waiting in the RA's room. I responded and contacted Shuna Wu
               (a/f/02-10-96), who stated she had been in her boyfriend's room
               earlier and he had assaulted her. She stated he had been
               playing video games and their pizza from Dominos had arrived.
               She stated she asked him to go with her to go get the pizza
               downstairs and he told her he was playing his game. She stated
               he was cussing at her and being very mean. She stated they
               argued and he continued to be mean to her. She stated she had
               paid for the pizza and went and got it. When she returned to
               the room, he told her to leave. She stated since she paid for
               the food she told him to give it to her. They both grabbed the
               boxes and were both pulling on the boxes when the boxes fell
               dumping the food on the floor. She stated he is a very clean
               person and became extremely upset the food was spilled on the
               floor. She said he got very angry, grabbed her by the neck, and
               threw her on the ground. I asked her when he grabbed her by the
               neck if her breathing was restricted and she said it was for
               just, "one moment". She said when he threw her down he threw
               stuff in her face. She said her hip was hurting her and she
               showed me she had large abrasions on her hip, a scrape on her
               elbow, scratches on her neck and face. Pullman Medics arrived
               to evaluate her and she was later transported to PRH by
               ambulance. Photographs were taken of her neck, arm, and hip.
               Medics asked her if she was having trouble swallowing and she
               said just a little. Wu told me this was the second time he had
               done this to her. She stated the first time was in China and
               they had been dating for almost three years. I then went to the
               boyfriend's room at 432. I knocked on the door and there was no
               answer. I continued knocking until a male answered. I asked the
               male to step into the halls so I could speak with him and he
               did. I asked him tell me what happened tonight with his
               girlfriend and he said they argued. He told me he was playing
               his video game and the pizza came. He said he told her to go
               get it and she asked him to go with her. He then asked me if we
               could step into his room because he didn't want to talk in the
               hallway. I asked him if he was okay with me entering his room

               and he said yes. I advised him I was recording our conversation
               and he said ok. He said he told her she was selfish and he told
               her to go back to her room. He said she was angry and she tried
               to punch him and he blocked it. He said he didn't touch her and
               did nothing. He said a couple of times he pushed her and, "was
               so angry with her". He stated he had pushed her twice. He
               stated she is always like this and lies. I asked him if he ever
               put his hands around her neck and he said, "yes because she
               still, I don't know what to say, I was so angry". I noticed him
               covering something on his forehead with his hair. I asked if he
               was injured and he stated it was just a scar and showed it to
               me. It was an old scar. I asked him if they had both been
               struggling with the pizza and he said yes, but said when he let
               go of the box she dumped it on the floor on purpose. I advised
               him he was under arrest for Assault DV and advised him he had
               the right to an attorney. I also advised him he was being
               visually and audioly recorded. I then asked him if he was a US
               citizen and he said he is from China. I handcuffed him, double
               locked the handcuffs, searched him, and asked if he had
               identification in the room. He said yes and allowed me to get
               his phone and passport. I had him pick out a pair of shoes to
               wear and a coat which was searched prior to placing it over his
               shoulders. I also advised him of his Consulate Statement. I had
               Asst. Chief Hansen transport him to Pullman PD where he was
               placed in a holding cell until he could be transported to WCSO
               Jail. I then went and spoke again with Wu. I was advised that
               one of the medics and the RA had gone to her room to get an
               item for her. They noticed the door was open when they got
               there and trash had been strewn around the room. Wu was asked
               if her room had been left this way and she stated no. The door
               had been shut. She stated after she left his room, she came to
               the RA's room and believes he is the one who went to her room
               looking for her. MORE TO FOLLOW I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this ____ day of

               a burglary alarm at the Outdoor Rec Center. There had already
               been numerous alarms earlier in the evening due to high winds.
               I know based on previous experience with this alarm that high
               winds cause the doors to vibrate and set off the alarm. We were
               experiencing very high winds at the time of this call. Officer
               Whitman and I responded and checked the building we found it
               secure. Shortly after clearing Whitcom advised of another alarm
               at the building. I advised them to document the alarm
               activations but not to create any additional cases. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under

               the building being unsecure although the building itself was
               closed. Upon my arrival I contacted an individual, later
               identified as Justin R Sprecher (08/31/96) who told me the
               following. Sprecher explained he gone to Flix to get something
               to eat and as he was nearing the building he saw 2 white males
               and one black male, whom he did not recognize, wearing
               basketball shorts and long sleeve shirts leaving Flix with
               items in their hands. All three males left through the main
               doors and ran up towards the back side of Goldsworthy Hall
               where they disappeared from sight. Sprecher tried to enter the
               building and found it dark, but was able to enter through the
               doors on the north side of the building and remained until Ofc
               Whitman and I arrived. I requested Whitcom contact a
               responsible and was later told Brian L Keithley (03/05/60)
               would be in route. I spoke with Sprecher for a bit longer
               before he was released. Prior to Keithley's arrival Whitman,
               Ofc Boyd, and I searched the remained of the area and found a
               few items out of place, but nothing which appeared to have been
               damaged. Boyd photographed the items and upon Keithley's
               arrival I pointed out what we had found. Keithley explained the
               doors on the north side had not been physically locked, and he
               believed when the power went out the door would automatically
               lock. We discussed this and I showed him what we had found. He
               told me he was unsure what if anything had been taken and I
               asked him to get me a list of anything missing and was told he
               would. I provided him with my business card and the case number
               for reference and cleared a short time later. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5904 SYNOPSIS: Burglary alarm at the Vet
               Teaching Hospital pharmacy. It was determined to be caused by

               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 11/18/15 at about 0258 hrs
               Dispatch toned out a burglary alarm at the Vet Teaching
               Hospital pharmacy. I responded and contacted one of the
               doctors, who was not identified, outside. She advised the power
               to the building was just restored and that likely caused the
               issue. She directed me to the pharmacy where I contacted the
               pharmacist, James F. Meyer (113058), who said the doors in the
               pharmacy had been open when the power was restored, causing the
               alarm. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 18 day of November,
               2015, in Pullman, Washington.
