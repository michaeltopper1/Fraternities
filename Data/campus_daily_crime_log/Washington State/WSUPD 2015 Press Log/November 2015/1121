               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5999 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched to a
               report of a non-injury vehicle collision near Orton Hall.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 11-21-
               2015 at about 1514 hrs I was dispatched to a report of a
               damaged vehicle in the "blue" parking lot located on the south
               side of the Rogers-Orton Playfield. The complainant, Michael F.
               Radka (DOB 06-02-1993), reported that he had observed a vehicle
               in the parking lot with two flat tires and believed the tires
               might be slashed. I arrived on scene and located the vehicle,
               which was identified as a yellow, 2000 Ford Focus (WA Lic.
               AVP7166). I saw that both the front and rear tires on the
               driver side of the vehicle were flat. Upon closer inspection, I
               saw that the sidewalls of both tires were punctured and torn.
               The puncture marks on the sidewalls were not smooth and had
               ruff edges. I observed that the wheels of both flattened tires
               had a distinct damaged area where the metal surface of the
               wheel had been scratched and dented. After examining the
               vehicle, it appeared that the damage to the tires most likely
               resulted from the forceful impact with another object during a
               vehicle collision. The damage to the vehicle is estimated to be
               $400.00. I photographed the vehicle, and photographs have been
               downloaded into Spillman and attached to this case. I
               identified the local operator of the vehicle as, Elizabeth A.
               Manning (DOB 07-19-1996). I later contacted Manning on the
               telephone and questioned her about her damaged vehicle. Manning
               said she was operating her vehicle sometime between 1900 hrs
               and 2000 hrs on 11-17-2015 and crashed into a curb. Manning was
               vague about the location of the collision and would only tell
               me she hit a curb while driving her vehicle "kind of near"
               Orton Hall. Manning said the impact with the curb caused the
               damage to the tires and wheels on her vehicle. Manning said
               nothing else was damaged in the collision and told me she did
               not damage any other property. Manning said she already
               contacted her insurance company and was arranging to have her
               vehicle repaired. No further action at this time. Olmstead/339
               I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws
               of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this __21__ day of __November___, 2015, in

               I was working in Martin Stadium for the WSU v UC game. I was
               contacted by Staff Pro near section 30 and told they wanted a
               subject ejected who was holding an offensive sign and being
               disrespectful with them. I spoke with the subject identified as
               Stephen L. Feenstra. Feenstra explained that he was holding a
               sign that read "We Falk'n Stayed" (in reference to staying for
               the game instead of leaving for the holiday). Feenstra said the
               sign was taken by Staff Pro and he was told he needed to leave
               the stadium. Feenstra was being polite and cooperative with me
               and I say his sign was torn and in the trash can. I asked Lt.
               Larsen if Feenstra needed to be ejected and he checked with
               Staff Pro management and they said they wanted him ejected
               because of his behavior with their staff. I told this to
               Feenstra and escorted him to the processing room. I read
               Feenstra his ejection warning and walked him out of the
               stadium. I could smell the odor of intoxicants on Feenstra and
               he admitted to drinking. Nothing further. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               09/09/87 Cited/Ejected Obstructing 5Z1188281 2. NARRATIVE: On
               11/21/15 at about 2015 hours while working the WSU football
               game Deputy Jordan and I were flagged down by a Staff Pro
               employee. He was with a male in the tunnel near section thirty.
               The Staff Pro employee stated he had asked the male, later
               identified as William C. Lieberg, several times to stay out of
               the isle in the seating area of section 30. The Staff Pro
               employee was going to eject Lieberg from the game. Lieberg
               began to argue. Lieberg was slurring his words and he was
               swaying as he was standing. I told Lieberg he was going to be
               ejected from the game. I explained we needed to go to
               processing I would get his name, read him the trespass warning
               and he would be leaving the game. Lieberg stated he was
               refusing to leave. I placed my hands on Lieberg's right arm to
               escort him to processing. He said "take your hands off me" and
               began to try and pull his arms away. I used a straight wrist
               twist lock to control Lieberg's arm and Deputy Jordan took his
               other arm. We escorted him to processing. Once in processing I
               asked Lieberg if he going to cooperate, he said he would and he
               had a seat on the bench. Lieberg was still very argumentative
               and animated. I asked Lieberg if he had identification on him.
               At this point he stood up and got very close to me and raised
               his right arm up. I took control of Lieberg's left arm with a
               straight wrist twist lock and he struggled to free his arm.
               Deputy Jordan took his other arm. Lieberg continued to resist.
               I attempted to take Lieberg to the ground. Lieberg walked
               forward resisting, I swept his left leg and we took him to the
               ground. I handcuffed(DL) Lieberg and did a quick pat of his
               waist line and pockets. I took Liebergs wallet from his back
               pocket and removed his WSU ID and Washington State Driver's
               license. Lieberg was picked up and placed on the bench. Deputy
               Jordan told Lieberg he was being recorded. I explained to
               Lieberg he was under arrest for obstructing a law enforcement
               officer and I read him miranda warnings from my department
               issued card. He said he understood his rights. Lieberg verbally
               berated everyone in the processing room while I completed the
               citation. I noticed a small bruise on Lieberg left cheek which
               can be seen on the video recording of the incident. I did not
               ask Lieberg if he wanted medical attention, but at no time did
               he request medical assistance. I issued Lieberg a criminal

               hrs I was working at the WSU vs Colorado football game when
               command advised there was a possible assault that had occurred
               in the bottom of section 4. Deputy Melcher and I responded. I
               contacted Colfax PD Officer Bryan who advised a female subject,
               later identified as Alexis T. Cooper (071897), was reporting
               she was assaulted by another female, later identified as
               Chelsie B. Samuels (112688). I spoke to Cooper, who told me she
               and her boyfriend, Devin G.A. Acevedo (080296), were standing
               in the front row at the bottom of the section when Samuels
               asked them to sit down. They said they were not going to sit
               down because their seats were wet and that if Samuels and her
               son wanted to stand on the bench behind them they could. Cooper
               said Samuels did so and a short time later pushed her knees
               into Cooper's back. Cooper turned around and pushed Samuels "a
               little bit". Samuels came at Cooper and knocked her glasses off
               her face and "tried to choke her". Cooper did not show any
               signs of being assaulted and had no marks on her. Samuels said
               she asked Cooper and Acevedo to sit down and they refused.
               Samuels and her son were standing on the bench so her son could
               see when Cooper was knocked back into Samuels by some people
               who were trying to squeeze by. At that time Cooper turned
               around and pushed Samuels. Samuels denied pushing or trying to
               choke Cooper. I warned Samuels that choking someone would be a
               felony and that I would have a camera placed on the area in
               case any further problems occurred between Samuels and Cooper.
               I spoke to a male in the area, who was not identified. He was
               sitting in a position to best see any fight between Cooper and
               Samuels. He said he was watching the game and did not see
               anything until the argument was already over. Nothing further.

               from Martin Stadium. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 11-21-15 at approximately 2020 hours, I was at
               Martin Stadium on the second floor of the press box when I was
               advised by Staff Pro they needed assistance with a female who
               was currently hiding in the bathroom. They stated the female
               was extremely intoxicated and when they asked her for her
               ticket she refused to give it to them. She then pushed passed
               them and refused to follow their commands. I called Stadium
               Command and asked for a stadium team to respond to my location.
               I went into the bathroom and the female eventually came out of
               the stall she was in. I asked her for her ticket and she began
               to look in her purse and then tried to walk passed me. I then
               asked her to walk out of the bathroom with me and as I grabbed
               her right elbow to help her walk, as she was stumbling really
               bad and had tried already to walk away from me, she tried to
               pull away from me. I put her right wrist into a controlled hold
               and escorted her out of the bathroom. I told her to stop
               resisting and to just walk. As we got out of the bathroom I had
               her turn into the corner so I could control her better. Ofc.
               Stewart and Deputy Cox were outside the bathroom. I asked the
               female for her identification and she began digging in her
               purse. I waited several minutes while she looked through her
               wallet. I could see she was swaying and using the wall as
               support. Her speech was extremely slurred, and she had the odor
               of intoxicants emitting from her breath. After looking she
               stopped and tried to walk passed me again. I put my hand in her
               chest and told her to stop. She shoved at me and then tried to
               shove my arm away. I pushed her back into the wall and told her
               to stop. At that point we advised her she was being detained
               and Ofc. Stewart placed her in handcuffs. She continued to
               struggle and she was told several times to stop resisting. A
               female approached at this time, who was later identified as
               Jerri Staniszewski. I asked her to wait a few steps back and I
               would talk to her in a minute. When the female was controlled,
               I spoke to Jerri. She stated she knew the female and her name
               was Amelia. Jerri wanted to know what was going on and I
               explained the situation to her. She asked if Amelia could be
               turned over to her and she would take her home. I advised her I
               would release her to her. Jerri advised me Amelia had been
               invited to their Suite on the 3rd floor, but because of her
               intoxication level, they had decided to not let her come to the

               hour I was working in Martin Stadium for the WSU v UC game. I
               was walking in the outer concourse near section 27 when I
               noticed a male subject stumbling out of the main part of the
               stadium and walk into the bathroom. He caught my attention
               because he was very unsteady on his feet and had a hard time
               opening the bathroom door. I waited until the subject came out
               of the restroom and I noticed he was still having a difficult
               time walking. I walked behind him and he was staggering left to
               right. I told him I needed to talk with him. I explained to him
               that he was way to drunk. The subject told me that he was
               leaving. I asked him where he lived and he said, "Away from
               here." As he spoke his words were slow and slurred and I could
               smell the odor of intoxicants on his breath. I asked him if he
               was staying with his friend who was walking with him and he
               said he was. I turned to his friend to ask him where he lived
               and the subject I was dealing with said, "Just let me go." and
               started walking away. I asked him what he said and he repeated
               what he said. I told him that he just talked himself into the
               processing room and told him to come with me. I grabbed ahold
               of his right arm and he began to pull away. I told him not to
               do that and escorted him to the processing room. Once in the
               processing room the subject was identified by Oregon license as
               Ryan M. Melton 04/17/90. I read Melton the ejection notice and
               walked him out of the stadium. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of

               MIP-Exhibiting NARRATIVE: On 11/21/15 at approximately 2100
               hours I was working in Martin Stadium for the WSU v UC game. I
               heard an Intern Radio that Staff Pro were escorting two
               uncooperative subjects to the processing room. I met up with
               the two subjects near section 27 in the outer concourse. I
               noticed one of the subject, later identified as Wyatt A. Hyer,
               was being escorted by a Staff Pro employee with is arms wrapped
               around Hyer. I grabbed a hold of Hyer's right arm and told the
               Staff Pro employee to relax and to hold Hyer's other arm. I
               looked back and saw two other Staff Pro employees holding onto
               another subject's arms, later identified as Tyson S. Martin,
               and escorting him to processing. Once in processing I asked for
               their ID's. Martin provided his and Hyer said he did not have
               his. Hyer identified provided 3 incorrect names before giving
               his correct information. It was clear that Hyer was lying as he
               initially told me he was 23. Martin told Hyer to stop lying and
               give his correct information. While talking with both subjects
               I could smell the odor of intoxicants on their breath. Hyer's
               speech was very slurred and he was swaying while seated. Both
               subject's eyes were bloodshot and watery. I spoke with the
               Staff Pro employees, Benjamin A. Smith, Robert D. Hampton, and
               Mark Williams. Smith told me that he had previously ejected
               Hyer from the Stadium and he came back in. When Smith went to
               bring him to processing Hyer attempted to run away. Hampton
               told me that when he was assisting Smith, Martin started to
               come between them and was grabbing at his jacket. Hampton
               continually told Martin to back off and eventually decided to
               eject him as well. When Hampton and Williams began to escort
               Martin he began to struggle and elbowed Williams in the chin.
               Williams told me the same story and added that he was not
               interested in pressing charges for the assault. I spoke more
               with Martin and he explained that he was just trying to help
               his friend out when he got involved. I explained to Martin that
               if he would not have involved himself, he would not be in
               processing. When I told Martin he was going to have MIP-
               Exhibiting charges forwarded on him he became upset and said he
               had already gone through the diversion program for an MIP. I

               explained to Martin that the purpose of the diversion program
               was for him to change his behavior and it clearly did not work.
               I told Hyer I would be forwarding charges on him for MIP-
               Exhibiting as well. I read both their ejection warnings and
               escorted them out of the stadium. I later realized I did not
               turn my VieVu camera on until I spoke with the Staff Pro
               employees. Charges forwarded. I certify and declare under

               Intern York radioed the need for an officer at section 30 of
               Martin Stadium for an alcohol offense. Upon arrival Intern York
               told me that the male, later identified as Chase William
               Edwards 05/04/94, had been seen with a flask but had handed it
               to a friend prior to my arrival. I asked Edwards where the
               flask was and he said he did not have one. Edwards' eyes were
               blood shot and watery. I could smell the odor of intoxicants
               coming from his breath. I told Edwards as long as he was
               willing to turn the flask over he could continue to watch the
               game. Edwards kept saying he did not have a flask. It was clear
               that Edwards was intoxicated. I told Edwards that he was being
               ejected for being intoxicated at the game. I took Edwards to
               the processing room where he provided me with his WADL that
               identified himself as 21 years old. I read Edwards an ejection
               notice and walked him out of the stadium. END OF REPORT I

               WSU Student Recreation Center. Sgt. Daniels and I responded to

               building. The lights were off and the building appeared closed
               for business. The front door, second to the left was found
               unsecured. I contacted the male inside the building. He said he
               came in, swiped his Cougar Card and began to work out. He
               thought it was funny that nobody else was in the building. The
               sign on the front door indicated the business was open until
               2330 hours. The male was identified and released. We checked
               the building, nobody else was found inside. The door was
               secured. A responsible was notified of the unsecured door. The
               alarm was reset and we cleared the building. No further
               investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury

               Conduct 2. NARRATIVE: On 11/21/15 at approximately 2220 hours I
               was working at Martin Stadium for the WSU v UC game. I heard an
               Intern radio for an officer to respond to section 26 for an
               assault. I responded and met with an Intern who pointed out a
               male subject, later identified as Bryce Cuello, and said that
               Cuello was pushed by another fan. I spoke with Cuello and
               learned the following. Cuello said he was sitting in upper
               section 26, 2 rows above the concourse. Cuello said there was a
               male subject sitting in the row in front of him and said he was
               wearing a grey jacket and a red beanie. Cuello said that while
               the quarterback was being attending to on the field he (Cuello)
               was standing and talking with his dad (Robert Cuello). Cuello
               said the male subject in front of him, later identified as Jon
               P. Arndt, turned around and said, "Sit the fuck down or I'll
               throw you over the railing." Cuello said about 20-30 seconds
               later Arndt turned around and shoved him in the chest with both
               of his hands. Cuello said Jon asked Arndt what his problem was
               and Arndt said that Cuello wasn't respecting the quarterback. I
               asked Cuello what he wanted to seen done. I asked Cuello if he
               wanted any assault charges to come and he said no and that he
               would be satisfied with Arndt being ejected. I went back and
               told Arndt to come talk with me, which he reluctantly did. I
               asked Arndt to tell me what happened. Arndt said nothing
               happened. I asked him if he yelled at someone else or pushed
               someone else and he said no. I spoke with a family friend of
               Cuello, identified as Cameron Mitchell, and he gave me the same
               account that Cuello did. I asked Mitchell if he saw Arndt push
               Cuello and he said he did. I went back to the stands and talked
               with Robert. I asked Robert what he saw and he gave me the same
               story. I spoke with another witness, Kris Mitchell. Mitchell
               said the same thing. The three witnesses were sitting behind
               Arndt and next to Cuello. I spoke with the Interns and asked
               them to gather Arndt's items, which they did and brought them
               to Arndt. I returned to Arndt and told him he was being ejected
               from the game and to come with me. Arndt just stood there. I
               explained to Arndt that he had two options at this point. I
               told Arndt he could cooperate and walk with me to the
               processing room or he could continue to disregard my request
               and he would be arrested for Trespassing. Arndt agreed to walk
               with me. We went to processing where I read him the ejection

               about 2130 hours while working the WSU football game, command
               advised someone had fallen on the stadium stairs and Pullman
               Fire Department may need assistance. Deputy Jordan and I
               responded and found PFD tending to a female who had fallen and
               was laying on the stairs. The female, later identified as
               Nichole B. Morgan, was placed on a backboard. The medical
               personnel were placing straps on the backboard to secure her to
               be carried down the stairs. As they were doing this Morgan
               appeared to pass out. When Morgan came to moments later she
               became combative. Morgan pulled on the straps and struggling
               with the medics. She was screaming and arguing with the medics.
               Medics were attempting to keep Morgan's head and neck still and
               she fought against them. Medics attempted to restrain her hands
               but she continually struggle against there efforts. Morgan's
               speech was slurred and she appeared to be highly intoxicated.
               Medics secured Morgan to the backboard and they took her down
               the stairs and placed her on the gurney. Morgan had restraints
               on her wrists but the medics were unable to secure her hands.
               As Morgan flailed her arms about while on the gurney the strap
               attached to her wrist struck one of the medics in the face.
               Morgan continued to struggle, argue and scream at the medics
               all the way to the ambulance and the hospital. On the way to
               the hospital Morgan lost consciousness again for a moment. As
               we arrived at the hospital Morgan vomited. At Pullman Regional
               Hospital her uncooperative behavior continued. I placed Morgan
               in protective custody and released her to the hospital. I
               completed the protective custody paper work and returned to the
               stadium. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
