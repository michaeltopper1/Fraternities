    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Olmstead/339 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5690 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched to an
               informational report. The complainant reported that he had
               previously reported an assault to the WSU Police Department but
               nothing was done. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 11-08-2015 at about 1527 hrs I was dispatched to
               an informational report. Dispatch advised that the complainant,
               Mitchell E. Nelson (DOB 10-12-1958), was in the Pullman Police
               Department (PPD) lobby and insisted on speaking with a PPD
               officer about an assault that occurred in Beasley Coliseum,
               located at 925 NE North Fairway Road. I contacted Nelson on the
               telephone and inquired about what he needed. Nelson said he
               wanted to speak with a PPD officer about two assaults which he
               had already reported to the WSU Police Department. Nelson
               explained that he had been assaulted by Staff Pro personnel in
               Beasley Coliseum, and he had previously reported this to the
               WSU Police Department. Nelson explained that the WSU Police
               Department did nothing with his case. Nelson was upset and said
               he did not "trust" the WSU Police Department and did not feel
               "safe". Nelson said his name has been "slandered" by the WSU
               Police Department and other WSU personnel. I explained to
               Nelson that the incident he intended to report occurred in
               Beasley Coliseum, and this facility is under the jurisdiction
               of the WSU Police Department. Furthermore, he had already
               reported this incident, and it was not necessary to report it
               again. I explained to Nelson that if he was not satisfied with
               the investigation conducted by the WSU Police Department, then
               he could file a complainant with the department administration.
               Nelson insisted that he speak with a PPD officer. I contacted
               Sergeant Dornes from PPD on the telephone and explained the
               situation to him. Sergeant Dornes agreed with my assessment of
               the situation and indicated that PPD would not take an
               additional report of an assault that had been previously
               reported to the WSU Police Department. Sergeant Dornes offered
               to contact Nelson in the PPD lobby, and then discovered that
               Nelson had already left. Information only. No further action at
               this time. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this __08__ day of

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC:MTK/336 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5694 SYNOPSIS: Report of drug activity.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Michael A. Mankowski
               11/04/96 Suspect Possession/sale controlled sub 2. Aiden Z.
               Harris 04/11/97 Witness NARRATIVE: On 11/08/15 at approximately
               2215 hours I was dispatched to a drugs call at Rogers Hall. I
               responded and met with Britteny Alspach (On-Duty RED) and
               Jessica A. McGettigan 04/06/94. McGettigan explained to me that
               after the Hall Government meeting around 2200 hours she was
               approached by the Hall President, Aidan Z. Harris. Harris told
               McGettigan that Michael A. Mankowski is approaching people
               trying to sell cocaine. Harris told McGettigan that she was in
               a friend's room (identified only as Austin) when Mankowski came
               in the room and showed them cocaine and offered to sell it to
               them. McGettigan said that Harris left the room. McGettigan
               said the Hall Vice President, Bailley A. Simms, told her that
               it is known to a lot of people in Rogers Hall that Mankowski
               sells drugs. McGettigan said that both Simms and Harris were
               reluctant to provide much more information. I asked McGettigan
               when the encounter in Austin's room took place and she said she
               did not know. I explained to them that since most of the
               information was 3rd party information I would not be able to
               pursue any search warrants at this time. I told them that I
               would forward the information to the Quad City Task Force. I
               said that if the Task Force wouldn't pursue it I would continue
               with the investigation and see if anyone would be willing to
               provide me 1st hand information. I sent an email to Ofc. Germer
               (PPD) and told him of the situation. I intentionally did not
               flag the case to go to Student Conduct at this time as it is
               still under investigation. Investigation continues. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.
               Dated this 9th day of November, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Mara I. Olais Ochoa 04/28/96 Charges Forwarded
               POM 2. NARRATIVE: On 11/08/15 at approximately 2320 hours I was
               on foot patrol in the Blue Lot off of Forest Way. I came upon a
               vehicle parked in the 2nd tier from the top that was occupied
               and running. I came up to the driver's side window and turned
               on my flashlight. The driver, later identified as Mara I. Olais
               Ochoa 04/28/96, was holding something in her right hand and set
               it on the center console. Ochoa rolled down the window and I
               could see smoke coming from the inside of the car and I could
               smell the odor of burning marijuana. There were two other
               occupants in the vehicle who were not identified. I asked what
               they were doing and Ochoa said they were just hanging out. I
               asked Ochoa who in the vehicle was 21 and she said the back
               seat passenger was. I asked if she knew why I was asking and
               she said, "Yeah it's pretty obvious." I asked Ochoa what was in
               her hand when I walked up and she said, "Marijuana." I asked
               Ochoa if she had a medical marijuana card and she said no. I
               asked Ochoa if I could see the marijuana and she handed me a
               partially smoked blunt. I could see what I recognized to be
               marijuana in the blunt. I explained to Ochoa that I would be
               forwarding charges to the prosecutor's office. I returned to my
               patrol car and ran Ochoa's information and noticed she was
               previously arrested by Ofc. Harris for possession of marijuana
               (15-P09244). I returned to WSUPD and NIK tested the marijuana.
               The test showed a presumptive positive result for containing
               Cannabis Sativa. I logged the blunt into evidence. Charges
               forwarded. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 9th day of November, 2015, in Pullman,

               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 11/08/15 at
               approximately 2358 hours I was dispatched to Perham hall room
               234 for the report of graffiti on the door. Upon arrival I met
               with hall staff at the room. They removed some paper they had
               taped to the door and I saw the words "Sam is a Geed" written
               with black marker. There were also scratches on the door and
               two swastikas carved on the door. I took photos and knocked on
               the door. The resident Samuel Marvin answered the door. I asked
               him when the writing appeared on his door and he said between
               1800 - 2100 hours. Marvin said the other damage was on the door
               when they moved in and they had previously reported it to hall
               staff. I asked Marvin if he knew who would have written on his
               door and he said no. I asked if he was offended or felt bad
               about what was written on the door and he said no. One of the
               hall staff members removed most of the marker with a paper
               towel and water. No suspects or leads. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
