    Narrative: RVWD: LT: OFC: Olmstead/339 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT ** COLLISION REPORT ** CASE #: 15-W1319 SYNOPSIS: I
               was dispatched to a non-injury vehicle collision in the parking
               lot of the Palouse Ridge Golf Course. DRIVER 1: Elmer W. Hansen
               (DOB 11-27-1937) VEHICLE 1: black, 2002 Cadillac Seville (ID
               Lic. ROSES) INSURANCE: Enumclaw Insurance Company / #AA50081522
               / exp. 03-20-2016 DAMAGE: rear bumper dented and scratched
               DAMAGE VALUE: $1000.00 DRIVER 2: Spencer S. Vik (DOB 09-07-
               1997) VEHICLE 2: black, 2001 Acura MDX (WA Lic. 971XET)
               INSURANCE: Enumclaw Insurance Company / #PA11107631 / exp. 08-
               07-2015 DAMAGE: both passenger side doors were dented and
               scratched DAMAGE VALUE: $1000.00 WITNESS(ES): n/a NARRATIVE: On
               03-22-2015 at about 1259 hrs I was dispatched to a report of a
               non-injury vehicle collision in the parking lot of the Palouse
               Ridge Golf Course, located at 1260 NE Palouse Ridge Road. I
               arrived on scene and contacted the following individuals: Elmer
               W. Hansen (DOB 11-27-1937) and Spencer S. Vik (DOB 09-07-1997).
               Hansen was the driver of a black, 2002 Cadillac Seville (ID
               Lic. ROSES). Vik was the driver of a black, 2001 Acura MDX (WA
               Lic. 971XET). There were no other passengers or witnesses.
               After speaking with Hansen and Vik, I determined the following:
               Vik was travelling southbound through the upper tier of the
               parking lot. Hansen was parked in a parking space in the upper
               tier of the parking lot. Hansen was positioned with the front
               of his vehicle forward into the parking space. There were
               multiple other vehicles parked in the parking lot and alongside
               both sides of Hansen's vehicle. Hansen backed out of the
               parking space and did not see Vik travelling southbound through
               the parking lot. The rear bumper of Hansen's vehicle collided
               with the passenger side of Vik's vehicle. Hansen stated that he
               believed the collision was Vik's fault. Hansen stated that
               while he was backing out of the parking space, he never saw
               Vik. Hansen stated that Vik hit his vehicle. Vik stated that he
               believed the collision was Hansen's fault. Vik stated that he
               was travelling through the parking lot and was looking for a
               parking space. Vik stated that he never saw Hansen backing up
               and was unaware that Hansen was backing out until he heard
               Hansen's vehicle colliding with the passenger side of his
               vehicle. Hansen and Vik did not complain of any injuries. The
               damage to the vehicles was consistent with the information
               provided by the drivers. The damage to Vik's vehicle was
               predominately on the rear passenger side door. The positioning
               of the damage (more towards the rear of Vik's vehicle)
               indicates that Vik had already driven past Hansen's vehicle

               when Hansen started to back up. I photographed the scene, and
               the photographs were downloaded into Spillman and attached to
               this case. I gave Hansen a verbal warning for unsafe backing. I
               explained to Hansen that when backing out of the parking space,
               the burden was upon him to make sure the roadway was clear
               before continuing to back up. Hansen was upset with my decision
               and stated that he would be getting an attorney. Hansen told me
               that he could not see anything when he was backing out of the
               parking space, because of the other vehicles parked near him. I
               tried to explain to Hansen that he should never have backed out
               of the parking space if he could not see anything, and Hansen
               sarcastically remarked that he should have had someone standing
               at the rear of his vehicle to ensure it was safe to back up. I
               cleared the scene. No further action at this time. Olmstead/339

               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 03-22-2015 at about 1839 hrs I
               was dispatched to a report of malicious mischief and a possible
               attempted burglary at Stephenson East #1227, 1265 SE Stadium
               Way. I arrived on scene and contacted Raul Arroyo (DOB 11-21-
               1996), Mitchell T. Stewart (DOB 04-21-1996), and Wyatt R.
               Degagne (DOB 07-23-1996). Arroyo is the resident advisor for
               the 12th floor of Stephenson East. Stewart and Degagne are the
               residents of Stephenson East #1227. Stewart and Degagne stated
               that the door to their room had been damaged over spring break.
               I saw that the surface of the door near the door knob had been
               gouged away into a shallow hole, and the door was cracked near
               the lock. The damage was estimated to be $200.00. Stewart and
               Degagne said the door was locked when they returned, and
               nothing was missing from inside the room. It does not appear
               that entry had been gained into the room. After speaking with
               Stewart and Degagne, it was determined that the damage occurred
               sometime between 1500 hrs on 03-13-2015 and 1800 hrs on 03-22-
               2015. I photographed the damage, and the photographs were
               downloaded into Spillman and attached to this case. No suspects
               or leads were identified. No further action at this time.

               NARRATIVE: On 03-22-2015 at about 2020 hrs I was dispatched to
               a report of a hit and run vehicle collision in the front,
               circular turn-around at Regents Hall, located at 1580 NE Cougar
               Way. Dispatch advised that the complainant, Ashley N. Wells
               (DOB 01-23-1996), had already left the scene and returned home.
               I contacted Wells on the telephone. Wells stated that on 03-22-
               2015 at about 2016 hrs she was driving her silver, 2000 Honda
               Civic (WA Lic. ANY3849). Wells stated that she parked her
               vehicle at the front of Regents Hall in the turn-around. Wells
               said that she was sitting in her vehicle with her friend,
               Krista S. Vandel-Lantz (DOB 08-24-1996). Wells said there was
               another vehicle parked directly in front of her. Wells said
               this vehicle backed up and collided with the front bumper of
               her vehicle. Wells said she felt her vehicle move slightly when
               the other vehicle hit. Wells said she exited her vehicle to
               contact the other driver, but the vehicle drove away. Wells
               said she could not see into the vehicle and could not describe
               the driver. Wells described the vehicle as a white in color
               SUV. Wells said Vandel-Lantz had obtained the license plate for
               the other vehicle. I contacted Vandel-Lantz on the telephone.
               Vandel-Lantz provided a similar account of the incident and
               said the license plate for the white vehicle was a Washington
               plate, AMT1336. Dispatch identified this vehicle as a white,
               2013 Jeep Patriot (WA Lic. AMT1336). This vehicle is registered
               to Nikki T. Schmidt (DOB 12-17-1993). At about 2057 hrs I
               contacted Wells on Monroe Street near Colorado Street, and she
               showed me her vehicle. I saw that the bumper had been scratched
               near the driver side corner. The damage was estimated to be
               $200.00. At about 2145 hrs I contacted Schmidt on the
               telephone, and she agreed to meet me at the front of Regents
               Hall with her vehicle. Schmidt arrived on scene a few minutes
               later and was driving her white, 2013 Jeep Patriot (WA Lic.
               AMT1336). I questioned Schmidt about the incident. Schmidt said
               she was in the Regents Hall turn-around with her vehicle

               earlier tonight at about 2000 hrs. Schmidt said she backed up
               and drove away but did not believe she had hit another vehicle.
               I checked Schmidt's vehicle and did not observe any damage. I
               told Schmidt that I would provide her information to Wells, so
               that Wells could decide if she wanted to submit an insurance
               claim. I cleared the scene. The damage to Wells' vehicle was
               minimal, and it is likely that Schmidt did not realize she had
               been involved in a collision when she left the scene. Schmidt
               was cooperative, apologetic, and promptly returned to the scene
               when I called her on the telephone. Taking all this into
               consideration, I decided not to pursue criminal charges against
               Schmidt. I later provided Wells with the information she needed
               for the collision. During the investigation, I photographed
               both vehicles. The photographs were downloaded into Spillman
               and attached to this case. No further action at this time.
               Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this __23__ day of __March_____,
               2014 in Pullman, Washington.

               the report of a cold burglary at Community Duncan Dunn room
               119. The RP, Margaret A. Altobelli, was requesting contact in
               the CDD lobby. I responded and contacted Altobelli. She told me
               that over Spring Break somebody entered her room and moved her
               dressers around, took items out of them, and went through other
               containers in her room. She told me she is very particular
               about the way she keeps her belongings and she is certain she
               did not leave her room this way when she left for break on 03-

               single room. Her room did not look like things were out of
               place to me. Altobelli then told me that she had alredy put
               everything back in its place and showed me pictures she took of
               what she found when she returned from break today. She told me
               that her drawers had been emptied onto the ground and other
               containers had their contents dumped out. She said she had
               contacted her RA to ask if they had done a room inspection and
               she was told no. Altobelli told me her room and window were
               closed and locked. She said the only way into her room was with
               her Cougar Card, which she had with her while she was home for
               break. I asked Altobelli if there was anything missing or
               damaged. She said no. Unknown who may have entered her room or
               why. I told Altobelli to contact me if she discovers anything
               missing or damaged. She said she would. I gave her my business
               card with the case number. No suspects or leads. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Edwards/330 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1333 SYNOPSIS: Father called requesting
               a welfare check on his daughter who had not contacted him upon
               her arrival to Pullman from Spring Break. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 03-23-15 at about 0412
               hours I was dispatched to the report of a welfare check at
               Stephenson South 907. The RP, Anthony L. Washington, was
               requesting a welfare check on his daughter, Angelica D.
               Washington. He said that she was supposed to call him upon her
               arrival to Pullman from Spring Break. He advised that his last
               contact with her was about 1700 hours on 03-22-15 when she was
               supposed to get on a bus in Spokane and travel to Pullman. I
               went to Stephenson South 907 and knocked on the door. A female
               answered. I asked if she was Angelica and she said yes. I told
               her that her Dad was concerned about her because she did not
               call him upon her arrival to Pullman. She said that her phone
               does not work because the bill hasn't been paid and that she
               had not been able to get her computer Wifi to work, so she
               couldn't contact him via social media or Skype. I asked her if
               she wanted me to contact her father for her, since she
               apparently couldn't. She said yes. I returned to my patrol car
               and called Anthony Washington. I told him what Angelica had
               told me. He thanked me for my time and ended the call. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 23rd day of March, 2015, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Corporal
