    Narrative: RVWD: 316 / OFC: JAK/333 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1284 SYNOPSIS: A homeless black male was
               said to have been "Pan handling hard" in the WSU Bookie.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Tony M. Dennie Warned
               Pan Handling 02-26-59 2. NARRATIVE: On 03-17-15, at
               approximately 1148 hours, Robin Schultz called Whitcom from the
               WSU Bookie. Schultz said there was a black male "Aggressively
               Pan Handling" in the bookstore and making customers
               uncomfortable. The male was described as being a 6'00" tall
               black man with a backpack and an orange headband. I responded
               to the WSU Bookstore and met the General Manager, Leslie
               Martin, near the front doors. She told me the man was
               "Aggressively Pan Handling" and had jumped up from one of the
               cafe' tables and began cursing at one of her employees. Martin
               said the man had already left the Bookstore and was sitting at
               one of the tables in the Cub talking with a white male. I
               approached the table where the two men were sitting and the
               black male said something to the effect of "Somebody called the
               Police on me?" I told him he was correct and asked him what was
               going on. He said "You probably want my ID" and I told him that
               was correct. He handed me a plastic card with his name and
               photo on it. He told me his name was Tony M. Dennie (02-26-59),
               and said he had recently been released from a Jail in Utah. He
               said he has never had time to get a state issued ID from
               anywhere. I asked Whitcom to "Run" the information Dennie had
               given to me. Whitcom got a return and informed me Dennie had a
               non-extraditable Misdemeanor Warrant, which Dennie said he was
               aware of. Dennie admitted to having asked people for food
               because he was hungry. He also admitted to having cursed at a
               female employee stating she had sprayed chemicals on the table
               he had been eating at. I told him he was not allowed to "Pan
               Handle" or ask people for money. I also told him he was not
               allowed back into the Bookstore. He said he would never go back
               into the Bookstore. The white male Dennie was sitting with
               identified himself as Bob Harvey and said he is an Associate
               Pastor at Emmanuel Baptist. I did not get full ID information
               for Harvey. Pastor Bob said he was going to take Dennie to a
               local Hotel and get a room for him for the evening. I cleared
               as Pastor Bob was walking Dennie out of the CUB. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 17th day of March, 2015, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer J.
