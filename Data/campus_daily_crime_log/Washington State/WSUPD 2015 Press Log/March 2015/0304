               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1069 SYNOPSIS: Located a vehicle PPD was
               looking for from a reported traffic offense. I contacted the
               driver and determined he was not under the influence of any
               drugs or alcohol. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 030415 at approximately 1027 hours, I heard
               Pullman PD being dispatched to a traffic offense and the
               suspect vehicle was being driven up Stadium Way from North
               Grand Avenue. I was in the area of Stadium Way and NE N.
               Fairway Drive when the call came in. I drove toward Grand
               Avenue and located the vehicle approaching Cougar Way on
               Stadium Way. I had dispatch run the correct license plate and a
               driver's check on the male registered owner. I followed the
               vehicle down Stadium Way and onto Grimes Way where the driver
               pulled into the parking lot at the LJ Smith Building. I parked
               and conducted a social contact on the driver. I contacted
               Phillip E. Rosenberg who told me that he was just out for a
               drive and that he may have been driving slower than the speed
               limit, but he was not driving over the lines of the road. I
               asked Rosenberg if he had any medications or intoxicants and he
               told me he hadn't. I explained to him that we had a report from
               a concerned motorist that he was driving erratically. He stated
               he drove slower to make sure he found the appropriate exit from
               the highway into Pullman. I advised Ofc. Umbright what I had
               learned and suggested that they submit him for a driver's
               reexamination. I cleared. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 4th day of March,

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: 316 / Macy WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1072 SYNOPSIS: The odor of marijuana
               coming from room 616 of Streit Hall. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 3/4/15 at about 1240 hours I
               arrive at Streit Hall to investigate the odor of marijuana on
               the sixth floor. At about the same time the ambulance was toned
               out for an individual who had fainted on the sixth floor.
               Arriving on the sixth floor I contacted Nick North the Hall
               Director of Streit/Perham Halls. North was in the restroom
               standing in front of a stall. North informs me Nathan Lewis
               (04/22/95), who is in the stall, had fainted and fell twice,
               and then after waking up the second time had to go to the
               restroom. When Lewis exited the stall he was very pale looking
               and his eyes were very dilated. I had Lewis set on the floor
               until the EMTs arrived to take a look at him. North told me
               Lewis and a number of other individuals had exited room 616
               before I arrived. North said he had taken names and would be
               forwarding them to Student Conduct. North said he was told by
               Lewis and other individuals, who had exited 616, that Lewis had
               fainted once before when believed he was going to be contacted
               by police. About this time the Ambulance crew arrived. While
               the Ambulance crew was dealing with Lewis I contact room 616.
               As I approached the room, Tyler P. Shuey (11/25/95) was exiting
               the room. Shuey continued to close the door as I was standing
               there, and as he did I could smell the odor of marijuana coming
               from the room. Shuey told me he was a resident of the room, and
               his roommate was not around. I informed Shuey why I was there
               and at first he denied marijuana had been smoked in his room,
               but eventually admitted it had. Shuey stated there currently
               was no marijuana in the room. For medical reasons I asked Shuey
               if he knew if Lewis had partaken of anything other than
               marijuana. Lewis said he didn't believe so. I was told again
               that Lewis had fainted once before when he believed he was
               going to be contacted by police. I then learn from North that
               as he was identifying individuals coming out of the room he
               observed a bong in the room. When I asked Shuey if there was a
               bong in the room he said there was not. But when confronted by
               North he admitted there was a bong in the room, but it had not
               been used to smoke marijuana. When asked if he would get the
               bong and let me take a look at it Shuey said he would prefer
               not too. Shuey was warned about smoking marijuana since he was
               under the age of 21, and on the WSU Campus. Shuey was also
               informed this situation would be sent to Student Conduct. Lewis
               was checked out by the EMTs and was not transported. Nothing

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1081 SYNOPSIS: Report of harassing text
               messages being received and possible computer trespassing.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 030415
               around 1617 hrs I was dispatched to room 124 of the Physical
               Education Building for a report of harassing text messages.
               Upon my arrival I contacted the complainant, later identified
               as Sharaya L Quinn (032496) who told me the following. Quinn
               explained she had started receiving text messages from three
               unknown individuals dating back to 022815. These text messages
               invited Quinn to a party and offered to pay her for what was
               implied to be sex. Quinn showed me the text messages and
               explained she did not recognize the return phone numbers, which
               I noted as 509-498-6282, 509-722-2384, and 253-697-6943. I
               asked her if she would email me the screen shots of the text
               messages, which she told me she would do, and I provided her
               with my business card and case number. As we continued to speak
               she told me she did not know who was sending her the text
               messages, but added someone had also been accessing her
               facebook, and yahoo email accounts. I asked her why she
               believed her accounts had been accessed and she explained she
               has changed the passwords on her accounts over the past couple
               of days only to find them changed again without her knowledge
               or consent. I asked her if she had all of her accounts linked
               onto her phone, which she did, and if she had let anyone use
               her phone. She told me she had not let anyone use her phone,
               but later told me it was possible her ex boyfriend who she
               identified as Nicolas C Lopez (102392) may have had access to
               it while they were dating. We spoke about Lopez and she told me
               she had spoken with him regarding the text messages she had
               been receiving, which he denied having any involvement with.
               She went on to describe Lopez as being possessive during their
               relationship and having been arrested for drugs at one point as
               well. Quinn continued and explained he was also in possession
               of some compromising photos which he had threatened to send out
               to various people at one point. I asked for Lopez's contact
               information, which Quinn gave me and we discussed numerous
               options to deal with the issues she had raised. I also asked if
               he currently lives here and was told he visits from time to
               time. When I asked who he visits she told he has a friend named
               Travis Kim, but she didn't know much beyond that. After we were
               finished speaking Quinn explained she was going to get her cell
               phone number changed. She also told me she would be changing
               her account passwords again along with the notification

               addresses. I told her to let me know if she had any other
               problems and after providing her with my business card and case
               number I cleared. Upon my return to the WSU Police Department I
               attempted to contact someone at the phone numbers Quinn had
               been receiving phone calls from. I found 509-498-6282 to be an
               invalid number and the other two numbers when to voicemail. A
               google search of the phone numbers showed two of the numbers
               were from Stevens County area and the last from the Pierce
               County area. I contacted both counties respectively and they
               had no contacts with anyone having the phone numbers provided.
               I later contacted Kim and he agreed to meet with me at the
               Student Recreation Center. Upon contacting him I asked him if
               he was familiar with Quinn and Lopez. He told me he was, but
               added he had not spoken to Quinn in quite a while. When I
               turned the conversation to Lopez he told me he had not heard
               from him in approximately 3-4 weeks, and he has not seen him
               since he had been home for Christmas break. I asked him to
               describe Lopez and he explained they played sports together and
               described him as a good guy. When I asked him about the text
               messages he told me he didn't know anything about them, and
               added it didn't sound like Lopez from what he knew. We
               continued to speak for a brief period of time longer before I
               thanked him for taking the time to speak with me and clearing.
               A short time later I cleared and returned to the WSU Police
               Department. I checked my email for the screen shots of the text
               messages I had requested from Quinn. As of 0057 hrs I have not
               received them and will contact her on 030515 and again try to
               obtain them and see if she received any additional text
               messages or problems with her accounts. Investigation
               Continues. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 5th day of March, 2015, in Pullman,

               2. NARRATIVE: On 030415 around 1946 hrs I was dispatched to a
               report of a theft of keys from room 120 of Neill Hall. I
               contacted the reporting party, later identified as Cherokee Y
               Kim (081795), and was told the following. Kim explained around
               1920 hrs she had been in a Lab class in room 120 of Neill Hall
               and as she was leaving had pulled her keys out as she had been
               walking out of the room. She then realized she needed to go
               back into the lab and upon entering had set her keys down on a
               desk top. When she returned she could not find the keys. I
               asked her to describe the keys and key ring and she told me she
               had her own vehicle key along with her home keys and a key for
               a vehicle for the golf team car on the ring. She went on to
               tell me the key ring had a purple in color tag which said the
               word Coach on it. We discussed the possibility of the keys
               being misplaced and checking the lost and found within Neill
               Hall as well as the Compton Union Building on 030515 as well as
               the WSU Police Department in the event they were located and
               turned in. I also asked her to let me know if she found them
               and was told she would. Nothing further. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               4th day of March, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               dealing with. Assistance was provided. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 03/05/15 at about 0059 hrs I
               heard Pullman Ambulance personnel request police respond to the
               Hilltop Hotel to assist with a combative patent. Pullman PD was
               busy with another call at the time and requested we respond to
               assist. I responded and found a female subject, who was not
               identified, in an ambulance in front of the Hilltop Inn.
               Pullman Fire Personnel advised the female was intoxicated and
               unresponsive upon their arrival. They believed, based on her
               condition when they arrived as well as her friends
               descriptions, that the female had a seizure. They said she
               needed to go to the hospital to be checked because of the
               seizure. We were able to talk the female into going voluntarily
               to the hospital. I rode with ambulance personnel to make sure
               the female did not become physically combative on the way.
