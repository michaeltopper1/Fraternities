    Narrative: RVWD: 316 / OFC: ENW/328 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1388 SYNOPSIS: Request to help locate a
               female student. Student was located and not in need of any
               further assistance. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 03-26-15 around 0815 hrs I was asked to help in
               locating a female student, later identified as Sara A Young
               (12-11-94), who had been reported missing on 03-25-15 related
               to a Pullman Police Department case (See Case #: 15-P02709).
               After speaking with Sgt Sorem of the Pullman Police Department
               I contacted Young by phone and she agreed to meet with me at
               apartment C-203 of the Birch Hill Apartments located at 2200 NE
               Westwood Dr. Upon my arrival I contacted Young who did not
               appear to be in distress. I asked her if she knew why we were
               trying to locate her and she told me it was because people
               believed she was dead. I told her that was correct and asked
               her if everything was all right. She told me she had placed
               herself in an uncomfortable situation last night and after
               arriving at the the apartment I was currently speaking with her
               in she activated the do not disturb function on her phone and
               did not receive any further calls. I explained Ofc Gordon had
               tried to get in touch with her last night. She acknowledged she
               had received the message and told me she had called him back
               this morning and left him a message explaining she was all
               right. I told her we just wanted to make sure she was ok and
               asked her if she needed anything. She told me she was fine and
               we concluded our conversation a short time later at which point
               I cleared the call. Upon my return to the WSU Police Department
               I contacted Sorem regarding my conversation with Young. He
               thanked me for my help and told me he would write up a
               supplemental narrative and let Gordon know what I had learned.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 26th day of March, 2015, in

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1391 SYNOPSIS: Report of a found parking
               permit. Subject contacted and was going to resolve the issue
               with parking services. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               McKinnie, Chloe C (02-11-93) referred to parking services. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 03-26-15 around 1015 hrs I dispatched to a report
               of a found parking permit in a vehicle (Wa. ALT1223) parked on
               Columbia St. Upon my arrival I contacted a Parking and
               Transportation employee who told showed me the vehicle and
               parking permit. I photographed the vehicle and parking permit,
               noticing a placard on the instrument panel with the name Chloe
               McKinnie. I asked the Parking employee the current value of the
               permit and was told it was currently $218.63. He went on to
               tell me the permit was also reported lost on 01-05-15 by the
               owner and it had not been reported to the WSU Police
               Department. When I asked who the owner of the permit was I was
               told it had been reported lost by Kate Cobb and was given a
               contact number for her. A check later of Spillman located a
               phone number for McKinnie and upon reaching her explained that
               I was at her vehicle and I wanted to speak with her. She agreed
               to meet me and a short time later she arrived. I explained
               there was a problem with her parking permit and asked her where
               she received it from. She told me her father had found the
               permit and gave it to her sometime back in January. She went on
               to tell me he works for a rental car company and had found the
               permit and she didn't realize there was a problem with using
               it. Around this point I contacted Parking Services and
               explained what I had learned. They told me they simply wanted
               the permit returned and McKinnie would have to deal with the
               associated fines before the wheel lock was removed from her
               vehicle. After speaking with Parking Services I explained what
               I had been told to McKinnie. She told me she wanted to pay the
               fines and get her vehicle released. I transported her to
               Parking Services where she returned the permit and made
               arrangements to have the wheel lock removed. I later returned
               to the WSU Police Department and downloaded the photos I had
               taken along with the video to this case and cleared. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 26th day of March, 2015, in Pullman,

               have accepted the task of getting rid of abandoned student
               computers. These were machines that were left at WSU CougTech
               and never picked up. We have 5 laptops that were not picked up
               and have been left with us between the dates of 10/10/2011 to
               7/23/2014. They have all been contacted multiple times and have
               not returned for their computers. Jeff Snook contacted Sherry
               Gordon with the Office of the Attorney General and she gave us
               information from RC 63.24.160. It says if the item is valued at
               greater than $100 we need to work with the Chief of Police for
               disposal. I would like to work with you to get these off our

               NARRATIVE: On 03-26-15 around 1400 hrs I was requested to
               respond to a report of a two car non injury collision which a
               Ofc Umbright of the Pullman Police Department was currently
               investigating. Upon my arrival I spoke with Umbright and was
               told the following. Umbright explained he had been previously
               dispatched to a report of a two car non injury collision on
               West Main St near Grand Ave. He eventually located the
               collision and determined it had occurred on Stadium Wy near
               Spokane St. He went on to tell me he had contacted both drivers
               and learned the white Dodge Dakota pickup (Wa. B39255N) driven
               by Nicholas A Cocking (10-13-91) had struck the rear of the
               vehicle (Wa. ADN5859) driven by Michelle S Phillips (07-12-94).
               Phillips had also told Umbright she had minor neck pain, but
               had refused medical aid. He also added both parties had already
               exchanged information and Cocking did not have insurance on his
               vehicle and his vehicle license was expired. At this point
               Umbright had cleared the scene and I spoke with Cocking and
               Phillips. Their description of the events of the collision
               matched what I had previously been told with the exception of
               Cocking telling me he had been glancing in his side mirror
               observing the demolition project currently ongoing at
               McAllister Hall. We spoke about this briefly before I asked
               Cocking why he did not have a current vehicle license or
               insurance. He told me he could not afford it and had let it
               laps but was intending on updating it. I obtained both parties
               information and I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this ____ day of _____________, 2014

               baseball from UCLA batting practice. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 032615 at approximately 1926
               hours I was dispatched to the report of a baseball striking a
               car (WA/AQU7707) near Bailey-Brayton Field. I responded and met
               with the RP, Diwaker Tripathi (091181). His vehicle was parked
               on NE N Fairway Rd on the south side, next to the baseball
               stadium. It appeared as if the baseball hit at the junction of
               the frame and the window on the passenger side of the most rear
               window. It dented the frame and shattered the window ($1000).
               The damage was consistent with a baseball striking it. During
               this timeframe UCLA was practicing at the field and another
               ball came over the fence. The team's bus driver said they had
               started at 1700 hours. I provided Tripathi with my business
               card and his case number. I also provided him with the contact
               information for Rick Fadness of WSU Risk Management. I advised
               him to contact him before seeking repairs. I later emailed
               Fadness regarding the event. Pictures were taken of the vehicle
               and the damage. Tripathi claimed no other damage than what I
               described. I cleared. Nothing follows. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of

               Erin A. Rylands/110195 Fwd. Chgs. MIP Exhibiting 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 03/27/15 at about 0042 hrs I was driving eastbound on Cougar
               Way passing the Lower Soccer Field when I noticed a group of
               four people walking eastbound on Cougar Way across from the
               soccer field. They caught my attention because one of the
               individuals, later identified as Erin A. Rylands (110195),
               appeared to be under the age of 21 and was having a lot of
               difficulty walking, even with both of her friends assisting
               her. She appeared to be highly intoxicated, stumbling side to
               side as she walked. I stopped and contacted the group near the
               Physical Education Building. I asked if they could stop and
               talk to me and one of the females, who was not identified, said
               "no that's ok thank you". I asked Rylands where she was going
               and she said home. Her speech was very slurred and she said
               something about "remaining silence". I could smell the odor of
               intoxicants on Rylands' breath as she spoke. At that time it
               was clear she was highly intoxicated and likely under 21. I was
               concerned about her level of intoxication so I asked her
               several questions about how much she had to drink and where she
               was to determine how intoxicated she was and if she was in need
               of medical attention. I determined she was coherent enough to
               be released to her friends. Rylands initially did not want to
               provide her name and date of birth but did so. The information
               provided confirmed she was under 21.I advised Rylands I would
               be forwarding charges to the Whitman County Prosecutor's office
               for MIP Exhibiting. Nothing further. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of

               next to the Lower Soccer Field. As I exited my car the female
               who appeared to be intoxicated, later identified as Sharaya L.
               Quinn (032496), turned and started to walk away quickly. I
               advised her not to run away and she stopped and walked to me. I
               asked how much she had to drink and Quinn said "a lot". I
               noticed Quinn was swaying side to side as I spoke to her. I
               asked Quinn if I could see her ID. She initially said she
               didn't have it but located it after I advised her it was
               sticking up out of her waist band in her pants. She provided me
               with her Washington Driver's License, which confirmed she was
               under 21. I asked Quinn if I could check her eyes to see how
               much she had to drink and she agreed. I administered a
               horizontal gaze nystagmust test on her and observed she had
               bloodshot and watery eyes, a lack of smooth pursuit, and a
               distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation. I could
               smell the odor of intoxicants on her breath as I administered
               the test. I advised Quinn I would be forwarding charges to the
               Whitman County Prosecutor for MIP Exhibiting. The other females
               with Quinn were not identified as they did not appear to be
               intoxicated. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 27 day of
               March, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.
