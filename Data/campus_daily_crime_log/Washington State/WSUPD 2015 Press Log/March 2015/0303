               brought in a wallet he found at Todd Hall. The wallet had ID
               showing the owner to be Sergio Salazar. Before I could even
               contact Sergio he came in, said he had ran into Stellan who
               told him his wallet was here at the WSU PD. I visually
               identified Sergio as being who he said he was due to the
               obvious resemblance to his ID. Sergio signed the Lost and Found
               sign in sheet and his wallet was released to him. It still
               contained the 36.00 US currancy that it had when he lost it.
               Sergio was way more concerned with all his ID and debit cards
               which were still in the wallet. Happy ending. I certify and

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1054 SYNOPSIS: Jennifer N. Thompson
               (090696) reported being called a "snitch". No crime detected.
               No Student Conduct. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 030315 at approximately 1639 hours I was
               dispatched to a Harassment at Goldsworthy Hall. I responded and
               met with Jennifer N. Thompson (090696) at her room. She allowed
               me in to the room where she had her RA, Cody E. Mannick
               (040994), her roommate, and an unidentified friend. Thompson
               recounted how last night at approximately 2330 hours she got a
               message that people were moving a hall banner over someone's
               door so that when the door opened they would walk into paper.
               She reportedly did not see who did it but learned it was Denae
               R. Rodriguez (110495). She informed Mannick who may have
               already known. Rodriguez confronted Thompson as a "snitch" and
               was upset that she told the RA. Later that night, Thompson
               claims she got a text from Rodriguez stating "Hey Snitch,
               thanks for the unfollow". Rodriguez later confirmed she sent
               the text. Mannick stated that the moving of the banner had not
               caused any damage and that she had met with the people in
               question. Thus, I determined I did not have a crime. I stated
               this and provided Thompson with the DV card in relation to
               protection/no contact orders. She stated she did not want any
               contact with Rodriguez. I informed her of how to approach this
               and later received an email. The email was addressed to me and
               Rodriguez's WSU address. With the subject heading of "No
               Contact", it stated "Denae, From now on, I do not wish to have
               any contact with you. This includes verbal contact, phone
               calls, text messages, Facebook, Instagram, or any other social
               media. Another form of contact included is third party contact.
               -Jenn" Thompson and Mannick requested I then speak with
               Rodriguez. I met with Rodriguez at her room and she let me
               enter. She did not dispute anything that happened but was upset
               the Police were called. I told her I agreed it was unfortunate
               that people felt we had to be called. She rolled her eyes a
               couple of times. I told her that currently I had not detected a
               crime but that Thompson did not want any contact with her, to
               include social media, or 3rd parties. I also told her that
               Thompson would be sending her an email that she did not need to
               respond to. I cleared. I later received an email from Thompson
               regarding a Tweet. It was from a Crissy Piland stating "Name
               calling=jail time in the dirty south". No one was tagged or
               explicitly named I do not have a crime. Case closed pending

               (011696) Forward MIP-Exhibiting NARRATIVE: On 030315 at
               approximately 2020 hours I was en route to a Lockout call when
               I observed 3 males walking to Hillside Cafe. I heard one of
               them yell something to the effect of "fucker" at a male in a
               blue t-shirt. It was approximately 30 degrees out. At first, I
               thought it seemed confrontational but them felt they knew each
               other. The male in the blue shirt appeared to be under 21 and
               was walking with effort. I know that the predominant clientele
               at Hillside to be under the age of 21. I continued to the
               lockout, completed the call, and returned to Hillside
               approximately 8 minutes later. I contacted a staff member, Dana
               R. Simmons (110792), and asked if there had just been 3 drunk
               males in the convenience store. She profoundly said there had
               been and that she could smell the alcohol coming off them from
               behind the counter. She said they had just left. I located 3
               males on the west side of Community Duncan Dunn and one I
               recognized as the male with the blue shirt from earlier. He was
               identified as Ian L. Schirato (011696). As I approached them I
               asked if Schirato had gotten caught on fire as I had seen
               Andrew J. Stirling (072596) wiping embers off of him. Schirato
               appeared dazed and breathing with an open mouth. They denied
               having come from Hillside. Stirling was smoking and breathing
               out towards me. As he did I could smell the odor intoxicants on
               his breath and he appeared to be under the age of 21. I asked
               him to stop smoking and he declined. I then told him to stop
               and he did so. Schirato began to walk away and I instructed him
               to sit down. I had to repeat many things to Schirato during out
               interaction. I had them sit down during our interaction as they
               appeared to be contemplating fleeing. I checked Stirling's eyes
               and observed a lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes. He then
               admitted to drinking "not much" beer. He then said I could
               check his backpack but then in the next sentence said I could
               not. He declined to provide a breath sample. He was instructed
               to sit down. He had to be told to sit down again. I spoke
               briefly with the 3rd male who was not identified due to a brief
               radio issue of Intern Dominguez's who provided a breath sample
               of .000 and was free to go. I then spoke with Schirato and

               asked him what his first name was and he gave me his first and
               last. I said I was going to check his eyes and he walked
               towards me and held his head down. Once he raised it, he had
               difficulty holding his head still. I observed a lack of smooth
               pursuit in each eye. I could smell the odor of intoxicants on
               his breath. He had slurred speech. I told him to sit down and
               had to repeat that as well. Stirling felt it was unfair that I
               had "rolled up" on them. I took his obstinate demeanor as a
               manifestation of his alcohol consumption. I informed both of
               them that they would be under arrest for MIP and that I would
               be forwarding charges to the prosecutor. The prosecutor would
               then be contact them at their local address. They would also be
               referred to Student Conduct. I told them to go inside and
               Stirling debated this with me. He finally began walking inside
               and mumbling words at me. The only distinguishable words were
               "fuck". I cleared. Nothing follows. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 3rd day of

               of MJ < 40gm 2. NARRATIVE: On 030315 around 2055 hrs I was
               dispatched to a report of the odor of marijuana coming from
               room 1121 of Orton Hall. Upon my arrival I contacted the
               complainant, identified as Jenafer L Doolittle (070988), who
               told me the following. Doolittle explained she had been called
               about the odor of marijuana coming from room 1121. She went on
               to tell me she thought it was being masked by some sort of
               spray and the odor was now dissipating, but added the odor was
               coming from the room. I asked if hall staff had any other
               problems with the resident and was told nothing that had been
               reported to law enforcement. After speaking with Doolittle I
               walked down the hallway towards room 1121 and noticed the the
               odor of the spray that I had been told about. I did not notice
               any odor of marijuana in the hallway. As I approached room 1121
               I noticed the odor getting stronger, but could not detect the
               odor of marijuana coming from within the room. Based upon my
               training and experience I know people who smoke marijuana try
               to conceal the odor with various types of air freshner or
               sprays. I knocked on the door, which was answered by the
               resident of the room, later identified as Jennifer L Mccutchen
               (102285). I asked McCutchen if she knew why I was there and
               initially told me she didn't. She was told it was due to the
               odor at which point she told me she had a small amount left in
               her room. I asked her if I could come into her room to speak
               with her and was told that would be fine. Once inside of her
               room we spoke for a brief period at which point she told me she
               usually keeps her marijuana in her car and smokes it there, but
               added her vehicle was in the shop being repaired. We discussed
               this at which point I asked to see her ID. She handed my her
               Washington State Drivers License which showed she was 29 years
               of age. At this point we discussed the use of marijuana in the
               residence hall. She told me usually doesn't, but did admit to
               have smoked earlier in the night. Prior to leaving I asked her
               if she would be willing to turn over her remaining marijuana
               and she asked me if she could give it to a friend. I told her
               that would be fine if they were of legal age and spoke to her
               about hall staff possibly wanting to talk to her. She told me
               that would be fine and prior to leaving I spoke with Doolittle
               to explain what I had learned. We discussed the issues with
               this case after which I cleared. Nothing further. I certify and

               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Austin J. Bozeman 04/03/94
               Cited/Released Poss. of Marijuana 5Z0305870 2. NARRATIVE: On
               March 3rd, 2015 at approximately 2334 hours I was driving
               northbound on Merman Drive and noticed a car with its parking
               lights on at the end of Merman Drive next to the entrance to
               the Magpie Forest. Based on my experience, the end of Merman
               Drive is a common area for drug use. As I pulled up to the Ford
               Mustang the driver, later identified as Austin Jacob Bozeman
               04/03/94, stepped out of the car and shut the car door. I told
               Bozeman that he was sitting in what was known as a drug area
               and asked what he was doing. Bozeman said he was singing in the
               car. I looked into the driver's side window and could clearly
               see a metal grinder that is commonly used for marijuana. I told
               Bozeman that he was being detained and handcuffed him. I had
               Bozeman lean up against his car and I walked to the passenger
               side of the car. I could see a large glass bong with burnt
               marijuana in the bowl sitting on the passenger side floor
               board. The car smelled strongly of burnt marijuana. I read
               Bozeman his Miranda Rights and asked him if he was willing to
               speak with me Bozeman said no he did not want to speak to me. I
               told Bozeman that since he is 20 years old I would be applying
               for a search warrant. About this time Ofc. Boyd arrived on
               scene. I placed Bozeman in the backseat of Ofc. Boyd's patrol
               car. I applied for and was granted a search warrant for
               Bozeman's car. I read Bozeman a copy of the warrant as he sat
               in Ofc. Boyd's patrol car. Once the search warrant was read, I
               started the search. During the search I located the following
               items: -1 metal grinder containing marijuana -1 vaporizer pen
               that smelled of marijuana -1 glass bong with burnt marijuana in
               the bowl -1 Rx bottle containing fresh marijuana (1.17 grams
               NET) After I found the grinder I had Ofc. Boyd inform Bozeman
               he was under arrest for possession of marijuana less than 40
               grams. After the completion of the search I locked Bozeman's
               car and transported him to the Pullman Holding Facility. Once
               at the holding facility Bozeman was fingerprinted and
               photographed. I issued Bozeman a Sector citation for RCW
               69.50.4014 Possession of Marijuana less than 40 grams. I
               explained the citation to Bozeman and provided him with his
               copy. Bozeman was released from custody and I cleared. Once
               back at the station the seized items were logged into evidence.
               The marijuana NIC tested presumptive positive for marijuana.
