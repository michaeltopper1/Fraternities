               lock out at the Chinook Village Apartments. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 03-21-15 at
               approximately 1923 hours Ofc. Olmstead and I were dispatched to
               a lock out at Chinook Village Apartments #U97, located at 540
               SE Forest Way. Ofc. Olmstead and I arrived, and we contacted
               Hayden J. Wise (DOB 06-20-94), who was locked out of his
               apartment. We verified Wise lived there, and when we went to
               unlock the door, we discovered the lock had been plugged. I
               called the Apartment Coordinator of the Columbia Apartments,
               Michelle Y. Burns (DOB 11-19-90), on the telephone. I told
               Burns we were unable to reach the Chinook Village Apartment
               Coordinator, and we needed to know if Wise was allowed in his
               apartment. Burns arrived on scene and said there was no reason
               the lock should have been plugged. Burns said she would unplug
               the lock and let Wise in. Ofc. Olmstead and I cleared the
               scene. No further action. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 21st day of March,
               2015, in Pullman, Washington.

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Edwards/330 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1316 SYNOPSIS: Report of a suspicious
               circumstance at Palouse Ridge Golf Course. Unable to locate
               anything suspicious. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 03-21-15 at about 2258 hours I was dispatched to
               the report of a suspicious circumstance at Palouse Ridge Golf
               Course. The RP advised he was an employee leaving for the night
               and that there were two people on the patio area of the club
               house. The RP advised that he asked the male and female to
               leave, but they didn't. He also said their was a white car in
               the parking lot and he did not know who it belonged to. The RP
               advised he was worried about these people were "poking" the
               area. He did not have a description of the subjects and said he
               had left 3 minutes before calling. I responded to the area and
               saw a white car parked in the lot. As I approached the car I
               could see two people inside. I walked up to the passenger side
               of the car and saw a male and female inside. I asked what they
               were up to and they said they were just talking. I asked if
               they had been up on the patio and they said they had gone up
               there to see if the restaurant was open to eat and when they
               saw it was closed they returned to their car. I asked if an
               employee had asked them to leave and they said nobody had
               contacted them. They both seemed cooperative and told me they
               would leave. I did not identify either of them, they then left
               the area. I walked around the area, checking the patio area and
               all clubhouse doors. I did not find anybody and the building
               was secure. I asked Whitcom if the RP could provide any better
               description of the people he talked to. When Whitcom called the
               RP back he did not answer. I had already left the area when he
               returned their call and provided a clothing description, which
               did not match the people I spoke to in the car. Unable to
               locate. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 22nd day of March, 2015, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Coropral
