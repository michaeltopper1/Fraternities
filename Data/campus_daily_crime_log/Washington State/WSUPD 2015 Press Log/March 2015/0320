    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: KDS/326 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1308 SYNOPSIS: RP stated her credit card
               was used on fraudulent charges at a Kroger outside the United
               States. Requested a report for the credit card company. No
               suspects or leads. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 032015 at approximately 1518 hours, I was
               dispatched to contact Hijung Lee regarding a fraud. Upon
               contact, Lee told me the following. On 032015 her South Korean
               credit card was used at a Kroger three times. She stated the
               charges were $505.95, $536.00 and $3.00. I asked her if she
               knew where the transactions took place and all she could tell
               me was that they were outside the United States. Lee stated she
               has her credit card with her and that she has no idea how it
               was compromised. I asked her if her credit card company knew
               about the fraudulent charges and she told me they did. She
               stated she was not going to be charged by her credit card
               company. Lee told me she had already cut it up and threw it
               away. I provided her with the case number and ended the call.
               No suspects or leads. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 20th day of March,

    Narrative: RVWD: dd/329 OFC: DBT/321 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1309 SYNOPSIS: I responded to a male
               sleeping on the grass by the blue heart. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 03-20-15 at
               approximately 1631 hours Cpl. Daniels and I observed a male
               sleeping on the grass by the blue heart, located at 1615 NE
               Wilson Rd. As we arrived on scene, dispatch advised someone was
               calling in to report the male was having a seizure by the blue
               heart. As Cpl. Daniels and I walked up to the male, he was
               laying in the grass curled up in a ball in the fetal position
               with the hood of his sweatshirt over his head. The male's
               clothes appeared to be very dirty. I shook the male and asked
               him what he was doing. The male told me he was just relaxing
               and reading the bible. I asked the male for his license and he
               was identified as Jared D. Roberts (DOB 06-07-91), by his Idaho
               identification card. As I was running Roberts name through
               Dispatch for wants, Roberts was telling Cpl. Daniels he may
               have a warrant. Dispatch advised Roberts had a non-extraditable
               misdemeanor warrant out of Kennewick for failure to appear,
               MIP. As we were speaking with Roberts I noticed he was unable
               to sit still, and he kept playing with the hood on his
               sweatshirt. He appeared to be tweaking. Cpl. Daniels asked
               Roberts if he was on any drugs. Roberts said he was not. Cpl.
               Daniels asked Roberts if he has taken drugs in the past, and he
               said "once in a awhile". Roberts said he usually smokes weed
               and has taken meth in the past. We asked Roberts how he got to
               Pullman, and he told us he walked from Spokane. We asked
               Roberts if he knew anyone in Pullman that could pick him up.
               Roberts told us his mom is a custodian at WSU. Ofc. Olmstead
               arrived as a backup officer. Roberts kept referring to himself
               as being an "angel of God" and continued to fidget. I frisked
               Roberts for weapons, and he did not have any. Cpl. Daniels
               tried calling Robert's mom, Cynthia M. Martin (DOB 04-07-60),
               on the phone but was unable to reach her. Roberts told us he
               was going to walk to Lewiston, and he walked away. Roberts was
               able to answer all of our questions, and he did not appear to
               be a danger to himself or others so we let him go. Martin
               called back and Cpl. Daniels told her what was going on with
               Roberts. Martin said Roberts has been diagnosed with mental
               illnesses in the past and has drug use history. Martin said she
               would try to find Roberts and give him a ride. Cpl. Daniels,
               Ofc. Olmstead, and I cleared the scene. My Vievu camera was
               activated, and the video has been downloaded into the permanent
               digital evidence folder. No further investigation. I certify
