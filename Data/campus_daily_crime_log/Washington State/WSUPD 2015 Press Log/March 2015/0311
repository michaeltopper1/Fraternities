               South I could smell the odor of marijuana in the hallway.
               Smelling at the door crack of room 417 I could smell the odor
               of marijuana emanating from the room. Standing and listening at
               the door for a few seconds I did not hear any movement or
               voices coming from within room. Knocked on the door several
               times with no one answering the door. I contacted Griffin and
               she told me she did not hear any activity in the room either.

               dealt with the odor of marijuana coming from this room. On

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1210 SYNOPSIS: Report of two individuals
               arguing near the Food Court exit of the CUB. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: Arriving on scene CUB
               Facility Manager, Cullen Addison, points to two individual
               standing outside against the CUB just to the right of the Food
               Court exit. The two appear to be calmly talking at this time. I
               asked Addison what he saw happen. Addison he did not observe
               anything. He said an unidentified person walked up to the CUB
               Front Desk and said two individuals were arguing by the Food
               Court exit and it appeared the male was leading the female out
               the exit by his hand on her neck. I contacted the two
               individuals and asked them what was going on. The male, Yifei
               Liu, stated it was their private business. I explained to the
               two of them because of their actions in, and exiting, the Food
               Court it was my business to make sure they were ok, and no one
               was being forced to do anything against their will. The female,
               Beiyu Jin, said everything was ok. Both of these individuals
               are international students and communication was not easy. I
               stepped a few feet away from them and asked Liu to come talk
               with me. About this time Officer Stewart arrived on scene and I
               asked him to talk with Jin. I told Liu the reason I was talking
               to him is because someone observed them arguing and then with
               his hand on the back of Jin's neck lead her outside. This
               person believed you may have been forcing Jin to go outside.
               Liu said they were arguing about an exam they have to night,
               and he may have had his hand on the back of Jin's neck but he
               was not forcing her. Liu did state they were boyfriend and
               girlfriend. I briefly explained the domestic violence laws of
               Washington to Liu. Liu indicated he understood and stated again
               that he didn't force Jin to do anything. Officer Stewart told
               me Jin just kept telling him everything was ok and nothing
               happen. Jin seemed to have a little more difficulty
               communicating in English than Liu did. At one point in their
               conversation I observed Officer Stewart point towards Liu and
               ask her if he was her boyfriend. Jin smiled and answered yes,
               and at the same time she appeared to blush. At this time I
               asked Officer Stewart to retrieve two Domestic Violence packets
               to give to Liu and Jin. While Officer Stewart was doing this I
               talked with Jin and informed her about someone believing Liu
               forced her outside with his hand on the back of her neck. Jin
               immediately denied she was forced. I then attempted to explain
               the Washington Domestic Violence law to Jin. When Officer
               Stewart arrived back Jin and Liu were each given a Domestic

               dispatched to the odor of marijuana coming from Scott Hall
               #103. I responded to the area and contact the R/P who was hall
               staff. They stated while on rounds the detected the odor of
               marijuana coming from 103 so they called the police. Officer
               Boyd and I went to the room. Prior to knocking the resident
               Athena Colbert came out of 101. She asked if she could help us.
               I asked if she was the resident of the room and she said she
               was. I told her why we were there and she denied smoking or
               having marijuana in her room. I asked if she would be willing
               to open the door of the room so I could check to see if the
               odor was still present. She said she would and open the door. I
               couldn't smell the odor coming from the room, but Boyd said he
               could. I asked her for her identification. She went to the desk
               and got her wallet. When she returned I could smell the odor
               but it was faint. We then told her we could smell the odor of
               marijuana coming from the room. After several more questions
               she finally admitted to smoking marijuana, but still denied
               having anything in her room. She made up a story about smoking
               an e-cig and that was probably the odor. I told her since she
               had been smoking marijuana in her room I would be sending the
               report to Student Conduct. She said she understood. I counseled
               her on marijuana usage on campus then cleared. After the
               contact I realized I had not turned on my body camera, but
