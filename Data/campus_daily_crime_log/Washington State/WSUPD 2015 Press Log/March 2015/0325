               at approximately 1950 hours I was dispatched to the report of a
               WSU vehicle (WA/19422E) with a door ajar in the Yellow Parking
               lot across from Bailey-Brayton Field. I responded and found all
               doors locked but the front passenger door was wide open. I did
               not find any signs of forced entry or damage. I locked the door
               and left my card with the vehicle. I later emailed Motor Pool
               to find out who rented the vehicle. Case pending. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               25th day of March, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1384 SYNOPSIS: Robert A. Watrous (DOB
               05-22-94) was cited and released for DWLS. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Robert A. Watrous / 05-22-94 Cited and
               Released DWLS 3rd C-9054 2. NARRATIVE: On 03-25-15 at
               approximately 2106 hours Cpl. Daniels and I were on patrol when
               I observed a red, 2007 Chevrolet Cobalt (WA Lic. 177ZRQ)
               heading southbound on Stadium Way. Cpl. Daniels and I noticed
               the vehicle's driver side headlight was out. I activated my
               emergency lights, and I stopped the vehicle for the above
               described violation on N. Fairway near Beasley Coliseum. I
               activated my Vievu camera and contacted the driver of the
               vehicle who was identified as Robert A. Watrous (DOB 05-22-94)
               by his WA driver's license. I told Watrous I pulled him over
               because his driver's side head lamp was out. I went back to my
               patrol vehicle, and I asked Dispatch to run Watrous for a
               records check. Dispatch advised Watrous' WA driver's license
               was suspended in the third degree for three FTA traffic
               tickets. I went back and contacted Watrous, and I explained to
               him I would be issuing him a criminal citation for driving
               while license suspended. I issued Watrous criminal citation #C-
               9054 for driving while license suspended in the third degree. I
               provided Watrous with his copy of the citation and explained
               the instructions on the citation. Watrous' girlfriend came and
               drove the vehicle away because she is the registered owner of
               the vehicle. My Vievu video was downloaded into the permanent
               digital evidence file. No further action at this time. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 25th day of March, 2015, in Pullman,
