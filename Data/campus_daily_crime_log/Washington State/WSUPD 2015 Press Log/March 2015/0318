    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC:MTK/336 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #:15-W1290 SYNOPSIS: Report of a suspicious
               email received by a former student. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 03/18/15 at approximately 0922
               hours I was dispatched to a fraud report. I called the
               reporting party, Heather Brackett, and asked what happened.
               Brackett explained that on 03/16/15 she received an email from
               walmart.com thanking her for her online order. Brackett said
               she did not place any orders from walmart.com, but mentioned
               that the billing information showed her name and old address
               when she was in Pullman going to school (Brackett now lives in
               California). Brackett told me she already contacted her bank
               and it did not appear any purchases were made against her
               "credit". Brackett also contacted credit reporting companies
               and warned them about possible fraud with her information.
               Brackett said the payment for the order was with a Visa and she
               said she only has a Visa bank card and not a credit card.
               Brackett forwarded me the email message from walmart.com. I
               noticed a payment method at the bottom of the page was a Vise
               with the last 4 numbers being 5171. I called the current
               resident of McEachern 237 (the hall director) and she advised
               me she did not make any purchases from walmart.com recently. It
               appears that there was an error with the billing address and at
               this time there is no crime. I asked Brackett to contact me if
               she notices any fraudulent charges with her accounts. I
               attached the email to the case, nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               18th day of March, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               had been provided a name of Sonja and a phone number, but
               didn't have a phone. I was able to contact Sonja who was the on
