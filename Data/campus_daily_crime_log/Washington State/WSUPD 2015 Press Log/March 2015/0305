    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Whitman / 323 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1105 SYNOPSIS: Responded to a report of
               a suicide attempt at Stephenson East. Subject was taken in to
               protective custody and released to Doctors at Pullman Regional
               Hospital. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 03/06/15 at about 2200 hours I was dispatched to a suicide
               attempt at Stephenson East room 505. The reporting party,
               Genevieve R. Yates (052095), said a male she was communicating
               with on social media sent her a photo of crushed up sleeping
               pills and said he was going to take them. Yates received a
               photo of the crushed up pills via "snapchat". The male was
               identified as, Zachary M. Chlipala (122695). Officer Petlovany,
               Officer Boyd, WSU Police intern Elwell, and I responded to
               Stephenson East. I knocked on the door to room 505 and Chlipala
               came to the door. He said we could come in to his room and talk
               to him. Officer Petlovany, Elwell and I entered and Chlipala
               asked if we would close the door. I asked him if he knew why we
               were there, He said he did. Chlipala said he had posted online
               that he wanted to kill himself and he was looking for support.
               I asked if he would be willing to talk to someone tonight and
               he said he would. He said he had a counselor on campus and he
               had been taking medication but stopped taking it about a week
               ago. Officer Petlovany asked about the crushed up pills and
               Chlipala got them, they were in a "tic tac" container. He said
               they were doxylamine succinate, and he still had some in pill
               form. Officer Petlovany asked if there was anything else that
               would be of concern in his present state of mind. Chlipala said
               he had several knives in the room. Chlipala allowed us to
               collect all of his knives in the room, two pair of scissors and
               some pills, both prescription and over the counter. He also
               said he uses the knives to cut himself, and said he cuts
               himself on the lower leg. I asked if he has had thoughts of
               suicide in the past and he said he had. Chlipala said he has
               been taken medication and seeing a counselor for several years
               because of his depression and anxiety. Officer Petlovany asked
               why he stopped taking the medication. Chlipala said he did not
               feel like they were helping him. Chlipala agreed to go to
               Pullman Regional Hospital and talk to someone. I explained to
               Chlipala that since he was going into the back of my vehicle I
               was going to search him. I found no knives or other weapons on
               Chlipala. I transported Chlipala to Pullman Regional Hospital.
               When we arrived at the hospital I explained to Chlipala I was
               placing him in protective custody. I explained that he would
               not be allowed to leave the hospital until he was evaluated by

               a mental health professional. I talked to the ER doctor and
               nurses and explained what Chlipala had told me and showed them
               the pills we collected from his room. I filled out the Release
               of Adult Protective Custody form and released Chlipala to the
               ER doctor at PRH. I processed and placed all items collected
               into the property room, locker 12. Nothing further. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.
               Dated this 6th day of March, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.
