               about 1930 hours I was on patrol at the CUB Senior Ballroom for
               the SEB "Swayze" concert. While there Officer Olmstead and I
               were approached by janitorial staff who said there was a female
               passed out in the janitor closet on the 2nd floor (room 202). I
               went to the janitor closet and tried to open the door, but felt
               there was something blocking it. I opened the door just enough
               to look inside and could see the head of a female on the
               ground. I tried waking her, without success. I forced my way
               into the room and found a female laying on her side, still
               unconscious. I was able to wake her to find out what was going
               on. I could see her eyes were bloodshot and watery and her body
               was limp. I asked her what was going on and when she spoke I
               could smell the odor of alcohol but was unable to understand
               what she was saying because of her slurred speech. I notified
               Whitcom of the situation and requested medics respond. While
               waiting for the medics to arrive I attempted to ask the female
               simple questions. I asked what her name was and could not
               understand what she said. I asked her what the date was and she
               said "September 12 March 1st". I asked her what day of the week
               it was and she said "Friday" and told me that it was 7 in the
               morning. When asked where she was she told me the "Swayze
               concert". I asked her where in the building she was and she
               said the "senior ballroom". When I told her that she was in a
               custodial closet she said "that's fine, go ahead of me." I
               asked the female how much she had to drink and she told me she
               could remember how much or what she was drinking. She stated
               that she had not taken any drugs. The female had her WSU Cougar
               Card with her that identified her as Ceridwen Faye Walsh. Once
               the medics arrived they asked Walsh if she had a friend she
               could call to come get her. She tried to call a friend but they
               did not answer. The medics advised that they did not think she
               needed to go the hospital. About this time I asked Walsh if she
               would provide a voluntary breath sample on a PBT. She refused
               and asked me why I was "making" her do that. I told her that I
               was not making her do anything and explained that it was
               voluntary. She again said no. I then told Walsh that she was
               under arrest for MIP exhibiting and that she was being audio
               and video recorded. I placed her in handcuffs, double locked,
               and escorted her outside. While waiting for a transport unit I

               read Walsh her Constitutional Rights. She stated she understood
               her right and did not want to talk to me. I did not ask her
               anymore questions. Officer Welter arrived and transported Walsh
               to PPD holding facility. Once the concert was over I went to
               PPD to process Walsh for MIP Exhibiting. While I was processing
               her she asked several times why she was there and what she was
               in trouble for. Each time I explained to her why she was
               arrested. I was able to fingerprint and photograph Walsh. I
               explained the criminal citation to her and gave her a copy. I
               told her a friend had called saying she would come pick her up
               and advised she could wait in the lobby for her friend. I told
               Walsh she was free to go and returned her property to her. A
               copy of the criminal citation was uploaded to Spillman Files.
               Refer to student conduct. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 31st day of March,

               from Mike's Bar to Orton Hall. The males stated the signal then
               stopped shortly thereafter. Ofc. Cornish explained that he
