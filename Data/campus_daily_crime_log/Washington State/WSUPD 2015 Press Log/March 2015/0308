               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1161 SYNOPSIS: Drew M. Nelson came to
               the WSU Police Department reporting he lost his cell phone
               sometime between 1900 and 2230 hours on 03-07-15. He is unsure
               where he lost the phone. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR#
               1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 03-08-15, at approximately 1423 hours, Drew
               M. Nelson (02-16-95) came to the WSU Police Department to
               report he lost his cell phone sometime between the hours of
               1900 and 2230 hours on 03-07-15. Nelson said he is unsure where
               he lost the phone. Nelson said he last remembered using his
               cell phone in his room in Orton Hall just before going to
               "Apartment Land" to party. He said he went to a party at Campus
               Commons North, apartment D-312 and got "Really Drunk". He said
               he left the apartment sometime around 2040 hours and began
               walking. It was at this point he realized he did not have his
               phone. He was trying to get back to Orton Hall, but he said he
               was disoriented due to his intoxication level. He said he
               walked toward some hills and crossed some streams before
               finally making it back to Orton Hall. I asked him what type of
               phone he had and he said he thinks it is a Nokia phone, but he
               did not know what model it is. He said he paid approximately
               $70.00 for the phone in December of 2014. He did not know the
               serial number of the phone, but said he would contact his
               parents to see if they had the information. He said he has
               never used the phone on the WSU Wireless Network. I gave Nelson
               a business card with his case number on it. I asked him to call
               me if he was able to locate the phone. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and

               malicious mischief at the WSU water tower located on the north
               side of the Palouse Ridge Golf Course. Dispatch advised there
               were five (5) males throwing rocks at the water tower. The
               males were last seen on North Fairway Rd. heading towards the
               tennis courts. The complainant, James C. Billings (DOB 05-11-
               89), was not able to provide further description of the males.

               with "WSU" lettering. Ofc. Olmstead and I responded to the area
               but were unable to locate the males. Ofc. Olmstead and I
               checked the water tower, but did not identify any damage. Based
               on the information in this case, the original report of

               and explained the reason for the stop. George provided his
               Hawaii Driver's License and Idaho vehicle registration. George
               stated he just recently bought his car and he was still working
               on getting it insured. I looked at the registration which
               stated the car had been registered in Idaho in January of 2015.
               I returned to my patrol car and ran George through dispatch.
               Dispatch stated that George was suspended in the 3rd degree
               through Washington and clear through Hawaii. I returned to
               George and asked to speak with him outside of his car. George
               exited and I asked George about his license. George said there
               was nothing wrong with his license. I told George that dispatch
               stated he had been suspended through Washington and that he was
               under arrest for driving on a suspended license. George was
               handcuffed (D/L) and advised he was being audio and video
               recorded. I read George his Miranda Rights off my department
               issued card. George stated he understood his rights. I placed
               George in the backseat of my patrol car as I filled out a
               Sector citation. Once complete I issued George Sector citation
               5Z0305873 for DWLS 3rd degree. I explained the citation to
               George and provided him with his copy. I told George he would
               need to call a friend to move his car and if he was found
               driving again he would be taken to jail. George stated he
               understood. George was released from custody and I cleared. END
               OF REPORT I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 9th day of March, 2015, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer
