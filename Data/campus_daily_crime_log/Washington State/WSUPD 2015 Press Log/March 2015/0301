               dispatched to a report of malicious mischief at the Northside
               Residence Hall parking lot, located at 1590 NE Cougar Way. I
               called the complainant, Kristen M. Ozaki (DOB 02-02-95), on the
               phone to find out what happened. Ozaki told me 02-28-15 at
               about 1700 hours she parked her green in color, Subaru Legacy
               (ID Lic. #8BAA099) in the Northside Residence Hall parking lot.
               Ozaki told me she was parked facing Cougar Way between the
               driveway and construction site. Ozaki said when she went to her
               vehicle in the morning on 03-01-15 at about 0950 hours she saw
               it had been damaged. Ozaki told me the plastic "UB" and part of
               the "S" on Subaru had been broken off the back of her vehicle.
               Ozaki told me she thought it had been damaged with a traffic
               cone, because there had been a traffic cone laying behind her
               vehicle when she discovered the damage. Ozaki does not know who
               may have caused the damage to her vehicle. Ozaki estimated the
               damage of the vehicle to be $500.00. Ofc. Olmstead and I met
               with Ozaki, and she showed us the damage on her vehicle. I took
               photographs of the damaged vehicle, and I have attached them to

               investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury

               report of a harassment at Goldsworthy Hall. A photograph
               ridiculing two female residents was posted in the hallway.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 03-01-
               15 at approximately 2028 hours Ofc. Olmstead and I were
               dispatched to a report of a harassment at Goldsworthy Hall,
               located 1455 SE Stadium Way. Ofc. Olmstead and I arrived and
               contacted the complainant, Kylie E. Marston (DOB 09-10-95).
               Marston is the fifth floor Resident Advisor of Goldsworthy
               Hall. Marston stated that an offensive poster was posted on the
               wall near room #523. Marston said the poster was put up on 03-
               01-15 between approximately 1800 hours and 1934 hours. Marston
               took down the poster and noticed that there were several males
               in the hallway laughing. The poster had photographs of two
               fifth floor, female residents on it and was titled "The Wall of
               Shame". The photographs on the poster had been removed from a
               bulletin board in the hallway. The bulletin board had
               photographs of all the fifth floor residents on it and was
               maintained by hall staff. I took photographs of the poster and
               bulletin board, and they have been downloaded into Spillman.
               Marston told us the two females in the photographs were Jocelyn
               Camacho (DOB 01-10-96) and Angelina V. Bezhenar (DOB 02-17-96).
               Camacho and Bezhenar are roommates and reside in Goldsworthy
               Hall room #523. Ofc. Olmstead contacted Camacho and Bezhenar
               and asked if they would speak with us. I showed Camacho and
               Bezhenar the poster with their photographs on it, which had
               been on the wall outside of their door. Both of them began to
               laugh and giggle. I asked Camacho and Bezhenar if they were
               offended by the poster, and both of them said no. Camacho and
               Bezhenar both thought it was just a prank. Camacho and Bezhenar
               were not concerned about the poster and did not request any
               further police assistance or investigation. Ofc. Olmstead and I
               cleared the scene. No crime occurred. Request case be forwarded
               to Title 9 Coordinator. No further action at this time. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of

               dispatch advised that an off duty Pullman Police officer
               witnessed suspicious behavior. He saw a male, later identified
               as Austin M. Reibman (100395), at the Sunset Mart filling a
               small water bottle with gas. Reibman then got in a vehicle that
               was not parked at the pumps and the vehicle drove off. The
               officer followed the vehicle which drove up Stadium Way and
               stopped at another vehicle standing in the far right lane of
               Stadium Way near Wegner Hall. Reibman put the gas from the
               water bottle into the standing vehicle (WA/AMF1255). I arrived
               as Reibman was exiting his vehicle because it still would not
               start. The vehicle started for a moment but stopped running. He
               attempted to let the vehicle roll back to the driveway between
               Wegner and Gannon but it did not have enough momentum. He had
               no phone and could not remember any of his friends numbers. He
               lived in Goldsworty Hall and thought a friend may be able to
               help. Reibman tried to start the vehicle one more time it
               started long enough to back it into the driveway and off
               Stadium Way. He ran to Goldsworthy and found a friend who had a
               gas can in his truck. Reibman retrieved the gas can, put gas in
               his vehicle and was able to drive away. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 2nd day of March, 2015, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer
