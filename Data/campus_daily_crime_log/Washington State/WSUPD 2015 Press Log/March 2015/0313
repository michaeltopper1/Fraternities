               juvenile WSU student. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               2. NARRATIVE: On March 13, 2015 at about 0850 hours I was
               dispatched to a welfare check on a juvenile WSU student. The
               complainant, Cynthia K. Miller (09/17/69), is the juvenile's
               mother. She told Whitcom that her daughter has not been going
               to medical appointments and she has not heard from her since
               September. The juvenile is identified as Alanna M. Spiller
               (05/12/98). This is the fifth welfare check by this complainant
               on the juvenile since October 2014. The complainant last
               requested a welfare check exactly one month ago on February 13,
               2015. Lt. Larsen contacted the mother by telephone and spoke
               with her in February 2015. I called A. Spiller and left a
               message for her on this date at about 0902 hours. After
               checking her class schedule I noticed she had a class until
               0900 hours. I went to her room, Stevens 309 at about 0930
               hours. I knocked on the door several times but there was no
               answer. The status indicator on her door showed she was "In
               Class". I emailed A. Spiller on March 13, 2015 at about 0954
               hours. The email has been added to the file section of
               Spillman. At about 1050 hours I went to Fulmer 226 to find A.
               Spiller. She was scheduled to have a class in that room at 1110
               hours. Nobody showed up to the class. I then went back to her
               room, Stevens 309 at about 1115 hours. I was not able to make
               contact with her at Stevens Hall. I left my business with a
               note written on it for her to call me. I called A. Spiller at
               about 1131 hours. I left a voicemail for A. Spiller to call me.
               At about 1448 hours I called A. Spiller. I left a voicemail for
               A. Spiller to call me. I received a telephone call from A.
               Spiller at about 1505 hours. She is well. A. Spiller said her
               mother can call her anytime she wants. A. Spiller said she is
               not leaving campus during spring break (next week) as she has
               no money and no where to go visit. I had a pleasant
               conversation with her. At about 1510 hours I called C. Spiller.
               I told her I made contact with her daughter. Specifically that
               the daughter called me at 1505 hours. I also passed on the
               message from A. Spiller that she could call her daughter. C.
               Spiller told me that I was fed a line of bull from the
               daughter. C. Spiller thanked me and then ended the call. No
               further investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 13th day of March,

               DEPARTMENT CASE #:15-W1256 SYNOPSIS: Box with feces inside sent
               to an employee. Investigation constipated due to lack of leads.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               03/13/15 at approximately 1300 hours Chief Gardner and Sgt.
               Macy presented a box to me with a business card sticking out of
               it. Chief Gardner asked if I could "dump" my assets into
               investigating the "matter". Not wanting to "waste" anytime, I
               took the box, which did not feel like a "heavy load", from
               Chief Gardner and noticed it had been re-taped. I asked if it
               was safe to open and Chief Gardner said that if I "do do" that,
               I should put on gloves. I donned a pair of gloves, removed the
               business card (belonging to Dawn Barnard), and cut the tape. I
               thought it best at this time to "log" all of my activity. I saw
               the box was sent from Max Power and was sent to Diane Barnard.
               I removed the tape and upon doing so I could smell the odor of
               animal excrement, based upon my training and experience. I
               asked Chief Gardner if there was egesta inside the box and he
               said there was. This increased my curiosity, so I sat on a
               "stool" and continued with my investigation into the matter. I
               opened the box and saw a white cardboard type bucket (similar
               to a KFC dinner bucket) with a label on top that read "I
               (picture of a pile of dung) You". There was also a website of
               www.ipoopyou.com written. There was red tape on two sides of
               the bucket. I noticed one side had been opened previous to my
               tampering. I opened the bucket and saw that inside was a
               plastic container with a business sized card on top with a
               personal greeting of "shit happens". I saw the plastic
               container had brown matter inside. I read the label and noticed
               that there was a warning saying that animal waste was inside.
               Being ever vigilant in my investigations, I opened the plastic
               container to confirm the contents. After a brief sniff, I
               confirmed the brown matter was most likely that of a bovine,
               based upon my training and experience. I took photos of the
               items and then "discharged" them into the trash. Having first
               determined what the contents were, my "number two" priority was
               to contact the recipient, Barnard. I called Barnard's number,
               but received no answer. Knowing it was my "duty" to complete
               the investigation I called again and spoke with Barnard.
               Barnard explained that the package was dropped off by Fed Ex at
               approximately 0900 hours on 03/13/15. Barnard said after
               opening the package she began to research the website and
               sender, determining both were linked. I asked Barnard if she
               had any suspects in the case. Barnard said she did not, but

               would not be surprised if it came from someone within the IT
               department. I explained to Barnard that it would be difficult
               to find who did it, and to find an applicable RCW violation. I
               explained to Barnard that the "bottom" line is I will do my
               best to get a lead. I sent Tom Ambrosi (IT securities) an email
               in hopes of checking WSU network access to the website
               ipoopyou.com. Ambrosi said he would look into it and get back
               to me on Monday. If I receive any information to follow from IT
               I will continue to pursue this investigation, otherwise the
               case can be closed as all leads "evacuated". Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 14th day of March, 2015, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer

               seen on a cell phone. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               2. NARRATIVE: On March 13, 2015 at about 1343 hours I was
               dispatched to Kimbrough Hall for a suspicious text on a cell
               phone. I responded to the building and contacted the
               complainant, Kelly Jo Kegerreis (04/05/67). Kegerris told me a
               cell phone was turned into the School of Music office. She saw
               a suspicious text that read "10 g sack to sell." Kegerris said
               as an EMT she is required to report this. School of Music
               personnel had already notified the owner of the phone's
               whereabouts. The owner was going to pick it up sometime today.
               I gave Kegerris my business card and told her the owner can
               contact me if they feel the need to but don't have too. I did
               not look at the text on the phone. I did not turn the phone on
               or activate the screen. The phone remained with Kegerris. No
               further investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 13th day of March,
               2015, in Pullman, Washington.
