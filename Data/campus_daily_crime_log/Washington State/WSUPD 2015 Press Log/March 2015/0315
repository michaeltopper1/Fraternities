               Pengcheng Xia 07/18/91 Cited/Released NVOL without ID 5Z0401211
               2. NARRATIVE: On 03/15/15 at approximately 2338 hours I was
               driving southbound on North Fairway Road Near the Grey 1
               parking lot when a black VW sedan tuned left from North Fairway
               Lane onto North Fairway Road. As the sedan turned it was
               accelerating at a high rate of speed. The sedan appeared to be
               traveling much faster than the posted 20 MPH zone. I activated
               my in car radar (vehicle 17) and obtained a reading of 35 MPH
               as it passed me. I turned around to catch up to the car which
               appeared to still be accelerating. I caught up to the sedan
               near the Student Rec Center and I initiated a traffic stop. The
               sedan pulled into the SRC parking lot. I contacted the driver,
               Pengcheng Xia 07/18/91, identified myself, informed Xia I was
               recording, and asked Xia why he was going 15 MPH over the speed
               limit. Xia said he was going to pick up a friend of his that
               was walking home and was cold. I asked Xia for his driver's
               license and Xia said he had forgot it at home. I asked Xia what
               kind of driver's license he had and Xia said it was a Chinese
               driver's license. I asked Xia if he had any other forms of
               identification with him and Xia said no. I returned to my
               patrol car and ran Xia through dispatch. There was no return
               for Xia. I filled out a Sector citation for RCW 46.20.005 no
               valid driver's license without ID. Once completed I returned to
               Xia and told him that he had technically had been arrested but
               I would not be handcuffing him. I explained the citation to Xia
               and provided him with his copy. I told Xia that he could not
               drive until he had his driver's license with him. Xia said he
               understood. END OF REPORT I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 16th day of March,
               2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               5Z0401212 2. NARRATIVE: On 03/16/15 at approximately 0033 hours
               I was parked near the intersection of Garden Ave and Merman
               Drive monitoring traffic when I noticed a Nissan Altima heading
               westbound on Valley Road approaching Merman Drive. I watched as
               the Nissan slowed to turn right onto Merman Drive. The Nissan
               turned right but never used their turn signal. As the Nissan
               neared Garden Ave I could see the female driver's face being
               illuminated by the light of a cell phone. The driver was
               looking down at the phone and not looking at the roadway. I
               pulled behind the Nissan and initiated a traffic stop at the
               intersection of Merman Drive and Terre View. I contacted the
               driver, Jennah Nicolette Smith 03/20/95, identified myself,
               informed Smith I was recording and explained the reason for the
               stop. Smith said she had been on the phone because one of her
               good friends was having a really bad day and she was going to
               call her as soon as she got home. I asked Smith for her
               driver's license and Smith said she did not have it with her. I
               asked Smith if she had any other forms of identification with
               her and she said no. Smith provided her vehicle registration
               but said her proof of insurance was inside her apartment. I
               returned to my patrol car and ran Smith through dispatch.
               Dispatch stated that Smith's return stated "Clear - Invalid
               Documents." Smith's license was not valid. I filled out a
               Sector citation of RCW 46.20.005 no valid driver's license
               without identification. Once complete I returned to Smith and
               told her she had been technically arrested but I would not be
               handcuffing her. I explained the citation to Smith and provided
               her with her copy. I told Smith that she should not drive until
               she cleared up her license. Smith stated she understood. END OF
