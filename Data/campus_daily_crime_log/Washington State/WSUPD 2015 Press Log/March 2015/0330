               she observed an overweight Asian American male walking toward

               being overweight and wearing sweat pants and a light colored
               tee shirt with a backpack. She described the gun as being

               a wheel lock removed from a vehicle in the gray 2 parking lot
               near Stephenson South. I contacted the reporting party, later
               identified as Jasmine A Leach (10-12-95) and was told the
               following. Leach explained she had received a few parking
               ticket and as a result received a wheel lock. She had gone
               online to pay for the her fines, and had a confirmation number
               which had been emailed to her. She now wanted to get the lock
               removed. I asked her if she would be near her phone and I would
               have to check on this issue. She told me she would and after
               speaking with her contacted Parking Services. I later spoke
               with Ian Ortlieb who told me he would have to check the system
               and get back to me on the status of the payment. A short time
               later Ortlieb called me back and told me the payment had been
               authorized and he would be sending a parking officer to remove
               the wheel lock. I thanked him and contacted Leach and explained
               what I had been told. She thanked me and told me she would meet
               the parking employee at her vehicle. Nothing further. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1482 SYNOPSIS: NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Seth A. Whittington 02/12/93 Warned Eluding 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 03/30/15 at approximately 2220 hours I was
               driving southbound on Orchard Drive near the SRC when I noticed
               a dirt bike style motorcycle heading northbound on Orchard
               approaching me. The motorcycle appeared to be traveling faster
               than the posted 25 MPH zone so I activated my in car (vehicle
               4) moving radar. I obtained a reading of 33 MPH. As soon as the
               motorcyclist recognized my patrol car, he quickly slowed down.
               As the motorcyclist passed me I turned around to initiate a
               traffic stop. Due to the narrow street my turn took longer than
               usual. By the time I got turned around the motorcycle had
               already turned left onto Valley Road. I turned onto Valley and
               did not see the motorcycle. Based on the time it took me to
               turn around the motorcycle should only have been approximately
               100 yard in front of me. Since the motorcycle was nowhere to be
               seen it was my belief that the motorcycle had speed off at a
               very high rate of speed or had ducked into a drive way. I drove
               up Cove Way which was the only street that the motorcycle could
               have turned on in that short amount of time. I found the
               motorcycle parked on the street parked in front of 1233 NE Cove
               Way. The motorcycle was parked and a helmet was lying on the
               ground next to it. I walked up to the motorcycle and touched
               the exhaust. The exhaust was still hot to the touch. After
               researching the license plate I found the motorcycle to be
               registered to Seth Alan Whittington 02/12/93. I found a phone
               number for Whittington and called him and left a message asking
               him to come talk to me. About 5 minutes later I saw Whittington
               walking up Cove Way towards me. I spoke with Whittington for
               about 5 minutes about his choices. Whittington admitted to
               seeing my patrol car and had the thought that if he found
               somewhere to park he could not get a ticket if he was not on
               his motorcycle. Whittington said it was stupid. I explained the
               crime of eluding and the consequences of it. Whittington stated
               he understood and had not thought of all the implications of
               his actions. I told Whittington that I would be referring him
               to student conduct and we would leave it at that. Whittington
               stated he understood. During my contact with Whittington he was
               respectful and forthcoming with the truth. END OF REPORT I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 31st day of March, 2015, in Pullman,

               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 03-31-15 at about 0148 hours I
               was dispatched to the report of a hit and run collision that
               had occurred sometime in the last couple of hours. The RP,
               Machado M. Mijiga, was requesting phone contact regarding his
               car being struck while it was parked in the Stimson Hall
               parking lot. I called Mijiga and he told me that he had noticed
               earlier that a car parked crooked in the stall next to his, so
               much so that he went to investigation whether they hit his car
               while parking. Mijiga said that he noticed white or silver
               paint transfer on the rear driver's side bumper that was not
               previously there. He said he took pictures of the car, a silver
               Toyota Highlander, WA/AMD5124, and also noticed that there was
               not a note left on his window. He told me that the car did not
               have the correct permit to park in the Stimson lot, so he
               watched from his room to see if the driver was going to leave a
               note on his car or not. Mijiga said he was watching the cars
               but turned for just a moment, and when he turned back around
               the car was gone. He could not verify whether there was a male
               or female driver. He said he went back down to the cars to see
               if the driver left a note, which they didn't, so he called to
               report the incident. Mijiga showed me pictures on his cell
               phone that he took of both cars parked as well as the license
               plate and parking permit (BL1 0672) of the offender vehicle. I
               asked Mijiga to send the pictures to me, which he did. Unkown
               at this time if there is damage to the Highlander. I returned
               to the station to identify a potential driver of the
               Highlander. I was able to determine that Alicia (Lee) C. West
               (08-30-88) was possibly the subject driving the Highlander at
               the time of the collision. West is an employee in the WSU Math
               Department, located in Neill Hall. Her office is located in
               Neill 103 and office phone number is 509-335-3926. Case sent to
               dayshift for followup. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 31st day of March,
