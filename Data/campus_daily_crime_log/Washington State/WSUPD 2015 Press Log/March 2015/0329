               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1465 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched to
               Goldsworthy Hall for a report of the odor of marijuana.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Shayde Olsen / 06-30-
               1996 Warned Possession of Marijuana 2. NARRATIVE: On 03-29-2015
               at about 2327 hrs I was dispatched to a report of the odor of
               burning marijuana originating from Goldsworthy Hall #221,
               located at 1455 SE Stadium Way. Officer Westerman and I arrived
               on scene and contacted several hall staff members in the
               hallway. I knocked on the door, and it was answered by Shayde
               Olsen (DOB 06-30-1996). Olsen is the only resident assigned to
               this room and is 18 years old. Olsen was the only occupant
               inside the room, and I could detect the odor of marijuana
               originating from inside. Olsen admitted to smoking marijuana
               inside the room prior to my arrival and stated that she had
               been smoking a joint. Upon further investigation, I determined
               that Olsen was in possession of a joint that contained green
               vegetable material (GVM). The GVM appeared to be marijuana and
               smelled like fresh marijuana. Olsen was also in possession of a
               pipe with burnt residue and stated that she had used the pipe
               to smoke marijuana in the past. Olsen was cooperative, and I
               explained to her that I would not be taking any enforcement
               action. Olsen agreed to voluntarily dispose of the joint in the
               nearby restroom toilet and the pipe in the dumpster outside the
               building, which she did. Officer Westerman and I cleared the
               scene. My Vievu camera was activated during this incident, and
               the video has been downloaded into the permanent digital
               evidence file. No further action at this time. Olmstead/339 I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this __30__ day of ___March___, 2015, in
