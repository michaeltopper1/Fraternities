               11-17-1986) reported that his vehicle had been damaged in the
               parking lot at Steptoe Apartments. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 03-14-2015 at about 1450 hrs I
               was dispatched to a report of a hit and run vehicle collision
               at the Steptoe Apartments, located at 1630 NE Valley Road. I
               arrived on scene and contacted the complainant, Xiangyu Yin
               (DOB 11-17-1986). Yin resides at Steptoe Apartments #D301. Yin
               stated that on 03-14-2015 at about 1200 hrs he parked his
               silver, 2011 Volkswagon Golf (WA Lic. AEE6604) in the parking
               lot located on the north side of the "D" building at the
               Steptoe Apartments. Later that same day at about 1445 hrs, Yin
               returned to his vehicle and discovered that it had been
               damaged. Yin showed me his vehicle, and I saw that the driver
               side had been dented and scratched. I observed horizontal
               scratch and rub marks on the rear, driver side door and
               extending into the rear, driver side quarter panel. The nature
               of the damage was consistent with being struck by another
               vehicle. I did not identify any paint transfer. Yin did not
               have any idea who might have struck his vehicle. The damage was
               estimated to be $500.00. I photographed the damage, and the
               photographs were downloaded into Spillman and attached to this
               case. No suspects or leads were identified. No further action
               at this time. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
