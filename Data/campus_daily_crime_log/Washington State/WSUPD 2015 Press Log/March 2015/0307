               approximately 0007 hours Ofc. Olmstead and I were dispatched to
               non-injury vehicle collision on Spokane St. near Sloan Hall.
               Ofc. Olmstead and I arrived on scene. We contacted a male and a
               female standing on the sidewalk. They pointed at a gray, 1991
               Toyota Camry (WA Lic. AML0368) and told us the vehicle had
               collided with three (3) other parked and unoccupied vehicles on
               Spokane St. Ofc. Olmstead saw that the front passenger side
               corner of the vehicle was damaged. We asked where the driver of
               the vehicle was. The female pointed at a male walking towards
               us on the sidewalk, who was wearing a white shirt. I asked the
               male in the white shirt if he was the driver of the vehicle,
               and he said "yes I am". He was later identified by Washington
               Driver's License as Brendan E. Lauck (DOB 11-01-94). Lauck was
               20 years of age. Lauck said he wanted to speak to his lawyer
               before speaking with us. Ofc. Olmstead asked Lauck why he
               wanted to speak to a lawyer, and Lauck said "I want to call my
               lawyer before I talk to any cops". Ofc. Olmstead told him he
               was involved in a collision and explained that we needed to
               figure out what was going on. Ofc. Olmstead asked Lauck if he
               was hurt, and he said no. Lauck had no visible injuries on his
               body. Lauck then stated, "everyone's totally fine, no one was
               in the car, I was the only person involved in the collision".
               Lauck looked through his backpack for his cell phone, but he

               could not find it. I told Lauck I was audio and video
               recording. Lauck continued to say he wanted to speak with a
               lawyer before answering any more questions. Ofc. Olmstead asked
               Lauck what was going on and why was he so freaked out about
               wanting to speak with an attorney. Ofc. Olmstead asked Lauck if
               he had been drinking. Lauck responded he wanted to speak with
               his lawyer before answering any other questions. Ofc. Olmstead
               asked Lauck if he was concerned about drinking, and he said "no
               sir". Ofc. Olmstead told Lauck he was concerned because Lauck
               had hit three parked cars. Lauck said, "I did hit three parked
               cars, but I would like to talk to my lawyer before answering
               any other questions". Lauck was insistent that he wanted to
               speak with a lawyer before answering any further questions.
               Ofc. Olmstead explained to Lauck that he thought it was strange
               for him to be requesting an attorney for simply being involved
               in a vehicle collision. Ofc. Olmstead explained to Lauck that
               we were not trying to get him in trouble, we just wanted to
               document the collision and make sure the owners of the damaged
               vehicles were taken care of. Lauck stated, "that would be fine,
               I'll admit that I hit their cars". Ofc. Olmstead asked Lauck if
               he would be willing to take some field sobriety tests, and he
               said "no sir". Sgt. Jacobson and Ofc. Whitman arrived as backup
               officers. I requested that they interview the witnesses and
               document the collision scene. For more information see Ofc.
               Whitman's supplemental narrative. I asked Lauck for his vehicle
               registration and proof of insurance. I accompanied Lauck to his
               vehicle, and he provided me with his registration and proof of
               insurance. Lauck dropped his car keys when he was exiting his
               vehicle. Lauck also found his phone inside his vehicle, he
               originally thought it was inside of his backpack. Lauck was
               also having trouble putting his wallet in his back pocket. He
               missed his pocket multiple times before he was able to put it
               back in and appeared to be having trouble with his
               coordination. Throughout my contact with Lauck, I noticed he
               was swaying back and forth. Lauck's speech was slow and
               deliberate, and his responses to simple questions were delayed
               and slow. Lauck's eyes were also bloodshot and watery. Lauck's
               statements were repetitive. We asked Lauck if he wanted to sit
               in our vehicle in order to stay warm, but Lauck said he was
               fine. We suggested to Lauck he sit or stand over by the stairs.
               Lauck said he would do this because he is familiar with this
               area of campus and hangs out around there all the time. As I
               was speaking with Sgt. Jacobson and Ofc. Olmstead, Lauck began
               to walk away. Ofc. Olmstead was watching Lauck and saw him lose
               his balance and fall into the bicycle rack on the sidewalk.
               Lauck was not following our instructions, would not stay in one
               location, and kept wandering around the area. This was
               interfering with our ability to conduct our investigation. Ofc.
               Olmstead and I became worried Lauck might attempt to leave the
               area. Based on these reasons, Ofc. Olmstead and I handcuffed
               Lauck (double locked). We told Lauck he was not under arrest,
               but he was detained while we conducted our investigation. I
               conducted a pat-down frisk for weapons without incident, and I
               placed Lauck in the back of my patrol vehicle. I detected the
               odor of intoxicants coming from Lauck. I later asked Lauck,

               while he was in the back of my patrol vehicle, if he hit his
               head when he collided with the other vehicles, and he said no.
               I asked if he had any medical conditions, and he said no. Sgt.
               Jacobson told Ofc. Olmstead and I the witnesses clearly
               identified Lauck as the driver of the vehicle. I took Lauck out
               of the back of my patrol car, and I told him he was under
               arrest for DUI. Lauck started to cry. I searched him incident
               to arrest, finding no items of evidentiary value or weapons. I
               reminded Lauck he was still being audio and video recorded. I
               read Lauck his Constitutional Rights from my department issued
               Miranda Warning card. I asked Lauck if he understood his
               rights, and he said "yes sir". I asked Lauck, having these
               rights in mind, did he wish to speak with me now. Lauck said,
               "I wish to talk to my lawyer". I placed Lauck in the back of my
               patrol vehicle, and Ofc. Olmstead and I transported Lauck to
               Pullman PD for the BAC. Ofc. Whitman facilitated the
               tow/impound with Myers Autobody. Upon arrival to Pullman PD, I
               checked the Datamaster and found it in proper working order,
               with the RFI antenna attached, the mouth tube was warm to the
               touch, and a temperature display within acceptable ranges.
               Times recorded were taken directly off of the BAC Datamaster,
               due to daylight savings time change. I read Lauck his
               Constitutional Rights at 0119 hours. Lauck said he understood
               his rights and signed the first signature block, but refused to
               sign the second one because he did not wish to speak with me.
               At about 0124 hours I directed Lauck to the interview room. I
               showed Lauck the numbers of the attorneys posted on the wall in
               the room and explained to him the ones he could call. Lauck was
               left inside of the room. Lauck was not speaking with anyone on
               the phone, so at about 0135 hours I dialed Mark Monson's phone
               number for him and left the room. Lauck exited the interview
               room at 0150 hours. Lauck stated that he had contacted an
               attorney, Mark Monson. I read Lauck his Implied Consent Warning
               for Breath at 0154 hours. Lauck signed that it was read to him.
               I asked Lauck if he would submit to a breath test, and he said
               yes. I checked Lauck's mouth at 0155 hours, finding no foreign
               substance. Lauck had to use the restroom, so I did another
               mouth check at 0203 hours when he returned, finding no foreign
               substance. Lauck provided a breath sample of .158 at 0225 hours
               and a sample of .161 at 0228 hours. The breath test was
               administered in accordance to the methods approved by the
               Washington State Toxicologist pursuant to the Washington
               Administrative Code. Lauck was fingerprinted and photographed.
               I issued Lauck criminal citation #9053 for DUI. I provided
               Lauck with a copy of the driver's hearing request, notice of
               hearing/conditions of release, tow/impound form, and the
               citation. I explained all the forms to Lauck, and returned all
               of his property to him. Lauck was released from custody. I
               later downloaded the video footage from my Vievu camera to the
               permanent digital evidence folder. I later faxed the DUI report
               to the Washington Department of Licensing. I completed a Sector
               PTCR. No further action at this time. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               8th day of March, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Matthew Joji Go 09/27/95 Charges
               Forwarded MIP Exhibiting 2. NARRATIVE: On 03/08/15 at
               approximately 0004 hours I was driving southbound on Library
               Road approaching Avery Hall when I noticed a male walking
               southbound toward Avery. The male, later identified as Matthew
               Joji Go 09/27/95 was having difficulty walking. Go was
               stumbling forwards as he walked causing him almost to fall
               over. Go was not making much progress forward due to his
               stumbling. As I neared Go, he turned around to look at my
               patrol car that was behind him. When Go turned around I noticed
               Go appeared to be under the age of 21. I drove a few feet past
               Go and came to a stop. I exited the car and asked Go if he had
               a second to talk. Go stopped and I told him to take his hands
               out of his pockets. Go did not take his hands out so I told him
               to do so again. I asked Go when he was walking to and Go said
               Stimson Hall. I asked Go for his ID and he felt around his
               pockets. Go said it was in his jacket. Go was not wearing a
               jacket. I asked Go where his jacket was and Go seemed to be
               confused. Go again told me it was in his coat and pointed
               towards the Greek Row area. I asked Go how old he was and Go
               said he was 18 years old. I asked Go for his name and Go
               provided it verbally. Go provided me with a date of birth of
               09/25/95 which makes him 19 years old. I asked Go if I could
               look at his eyes and he said I could. I performed an HGN test
               on Go. I told Go to stand with his heels and toes together and
               follow the tip of my pen with his eyes only. Go stated he
               understood. During the test I observed equal tracking, equal
               pupil size, lack of smooth pursuit, distinct and sustained
               nystagmus at maximum deviation, and onset of nystagmus prior to
               45 degrees. During the test Go was swaying severely forwards
               and backwards. I asked Go how much he had to drink. Go said
               about four mixed drinks. I asked Go to blow into my hand and as
               he did I could clearly smell the strong odor of intoxicants
               coming from his breath. I asked Go if he was willing to provide
               a PBT sample and Go said no. Go's name was ran through dispatch
               and there was no return. I asked to confirm Go's information.
               Go provided the same name but when it came to his date of birth
               Go began to struggle. Go told me his birthday was September
               95th, 1995. I told Go that there was not a 95th day of
               September. Go said, "are you sure about that?" I told Go I was
               sure. After a few more tries Go was able to tell me the date of

               birth of 09/27/95. The new date of birth was ran and I obtained
               a valid return for Go. I told Go that he was under arrest for
               MIP and handcuffed (D/L) him. I told Go that he was being audio
               and video recorded. Go said he wanted to go to the hospital. I
               asked Go why he wanted to go to the hospital. Go stated, "my
               stomach, I feel I need to go to the hospital. My stomach I feel
               like I'm really intoxicated." I again asked Go if he wanted
               medics to respond and he said yes. I read Go his Miranda Rights
               off my department issued card. Go stated he understood his
               rights but wanted a lawyer. I told Go that I did not have any
               more questions for him so I would not be providing him with a
               lawyer. Go was searched incident to arrest and no weapons or
               illegal items were found. I did not ask Go any questions
               however Go continued to ask me questions. Go asked several
               questions but most of them did not make sense. Go asked a
               question that I interpreted as Go asking why was he being
               charged with MIP if he needed to go to the hospital. I told Go
               that going to the hospital does not mean I cannot charge him.
               Go said, "oh." I had Go lean up against my patrol car while we
               waited for medics to arrive. At one point Go said, "why are you
               fucking me over with this?" I told Go I was not fucking him
               over but rather he made a choice to drink underage tonight and
               his choice has consequences. Go became emotional and began to
               cry. I explained how my charges were going to be forwarded to
               the prosecutor and how they would contact him two times. Once
               medics arrived I unhandcuffed Go and told him that he was free
               to go. I walked approximately 15 feet away from Go so he did
               not feel as if he was still be detained. Go talked to the
               medics for a few minutes. One medic came over to me and told me
               that Go was afraid that if he took a step away from the medics
               he would be arrested. I walked over to go and told him he was
               free to go he was not being detained in any manner. Go asked if
               he was going to be arrested if he walked over there. I told him
               no. Go kept asking if this was going to be on his record. I
               explained two more times how the court process works however Go
               kept asking. Go asked if he could force me to take him home. I
               told Go that he could not force me but I would give him a ride
               if he wanted. Go said he did want a ride and no longer needed
               medical attention. I drove Go to Stimson Hall and dropped Go
               off. Go again asked if this was going to go onto his record. I
               told Go that I had answered all of his questions numerous times
               and was not longer going to answer them again. I told Go to go
               to his room and got into my patrol car. Go began to yell that
               he was going to call 911 as I drove away. Go did not call 911
               as he had threatened. Charges of MIP Exhibiting will be
               forwarded to the prosecutor on Go. END OF REPORT I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               8th day of March, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1153 SYNOPSIS: Williams arrested, cited,
               and released for MIP Exhibiting. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Siena C. Williams 03/27/96 Cited/Released MIP
               Exhibiting 2. NARRATIVE: On 03/08/15 at approximately 0106
               hours I had just turned onto Cougar Way from Stadium Way when I
               noticed a female, later identified as Siena Christel Williams
               03/27/96, on the ground next to a parked car in the Streit
               Perham turn around. Williams appeared as if she had just fallen
               down. A second female, later identified as Ida S. Basha
               09/29/96, was trying to help Williams up. I pulled into the
               turn around to check on Williams wellbeing. As I pulled up to
               the two I asked if they were ok. Basha said they were fine and
               just going inside. Williams was having difficulty standing up
               even with Basha's help and appeared to be very intoxicated.
               Both Williams and Basha appeared to be well under the age of
               21. I exited my car as Basha was trying to get Williams towards
               the building before I could talk to them. Williams stood up and
               started stumbling towards the door. I asked Basha what
               Williams' name was and Basha said it was Siena. I called to
               Siena who was walking away from me. After calling after
               Williams a few times she stopped. I told Williams that she was
               being detained and not free to go. I noticed Williams had
               several large scrapes down her knees and legs. I asked Williams
               if she was ok and she said she was. Williams said she fell
               because of a large crack in the pavement. I asked Williams if
               she had her ID with her and Williams said, "do you want my
               military ID because my dad can call you and tell you what's up.
               He'll tell you I'm fine." I asked Williams how her father would
               know if she was fine or not. Williams said she had just called
               him and told him she was coming outside. I asked Williams if
               her father lived in Pullman and Williams said no he lives in
               Oklahoma. I was not sure why Williams was talking about her
               father. Williams was not making a lot of sense. Williams
               provided me with a military ID. About this time Sgt. Griffin
               arrived on scene. I asked Williams how much she had to drink
               tonight. Williams said, "not a lot." I asked Williams how much
               was not a lot and Williams said 3 to 5 shots. I asked Williams
               if I could look at her eyes. I told Williams to stand with her
               heels and toes together while keeping her arms at her sides.
               Williams turned to face me but she was stumbling back and
               forth. Basha put her hands on Williams back to steady her. I
               asked Basha to stand to the side of Williams so Williams was
               unsupported. I told Williams to follow the tip of my pen with

               her eyes only and keep her head still. As soon as Williams
               looked at the pen she lost her balance and started to stumble
               backwards. Williams stumbled around for about four seconds
               before she regained her balance. During the test Williams was
               severely swaying in all directions making it almost impossible
               to observe her eyes. During the test I was able to observe
               equal tracking, equal pupil size, and lack of smooth pursuit. I
               stopped the test early in fear that Williams was going to fall
               over. I asked Williams to blow into my hand and as she did I
               could clearly smell the odor of intoxicants coming from her
               breath. I asked Williams if she had more than three to five
               shots. Williams said, "if someone ruffied my drink then that's
               what it is." I asked Williams why she thought someone would
               ruffie her drink. Williams replied, "because there are so many
               guys that think I'm attractive." I asked Williams if she had
               any reason to believe she was drugged. Williams said, "because
               I'm really attractive." I told Williams that being attractive
               is not a reason why she would believe she was drugged. Williams
               stated, "I mean I'm in women's studies and if guys think I'm
               really attractive that's the only reason. I mean if guys don't
               think I'm attractive then you can take me to jail." Williams
               was clearly so intoxicated that she was not making sense. I
               asked Williams a series of questions to determine her mental
               status. Williams was able to answer most of my questions
               correctly. I ran Williams name through dispatch and they stated
               Williams had been contacted on 09/02/14 for smoking marijuana
               in her dorm room. I told Williams that she was under arrest for
               MIP Exhibiting and handcuffed (D/L) her. I told Williams that
               she was being audio and video recorded. I read Williams her
               Miranda Rights off my department issued card. Williams stated
               she understood her rights. Williams was searched incident to
               arrest and no weapons or illegal items on her. I filled out a
               Sector citation for MIP Exhibiting and issued it to Williams. I
               explained the citation and provided Williams with her copy.
               Williams was turned over to Basha who was sober. Williams and
               Basha walked into Streit Perham. END OF REPORT I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
