               approximately 2048 hours Officer Olmstead and I were on patrol
               when I observed a white, 2011 Toyota Tundra (WA Lic. C87399B)
               heading southbound on Stadium Way. Ofc. Olmstead and I noticed
               the vehicle's driver side headlight was out. I activated my
               emergency lights, and I stopped the vehicle for the above
               described violation on Stadium Way near Troy Lane. I activated
               my Vievu camera and contacted the driver of the vehicle, who
               was identified as Brianna N. Moore-Green (DOB 11-17-94) by her
               WA driver's license. I told Moore-Green I was recording, and I
               pulled her over because her driver's side headlight was out. I
               went back to my patrol vehicle, and I asked Dispatch to run
               Moore-Green for a records check. Dispatch advised Moore-Green's
               WA driver's license status was suspended in the third degree.
               Ofc. Petlovany arrived on scene as a backup officer. I went
               back and contacted Moore-Green and asked her to step out of the
               vehicle. I told Moore-Green she was under arrest for driving
               while license suspended in the third degree. I handcuffed
               Moore-Green (double locked). I reminded Moore-Green she was
               still being audio and video recorded. I searched Moore-Green
               incident to arrest, and I placed her in the back of my patrol
               vehicle all without incident. I read Moore-Green her
               Constitutional Rights from my department issued Miranda Warning
               card. I issued Moore-Green Sector criminal citation #5Z0228105
               for driving while license suspended in the third degree. I
               provided Moore-Green with her copy of the citation and
               explained the instructions on the citation. Moore-Green was
               released. Moore-Green's passenger had a valid driver's license,
               so she drove the vehicle away. My Vievu video has been
               downloaded into the permanent digital evidence file, and my
               Sector citation has been attached to Spillman. No further

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1427 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched to the
               odor of marijuana coming from a room in Stephenson East. I
               obtained a search warrant for the room, and charges will be
               forwarded to the Whitman County Prosecuting Attorney's Office.

               NARRATIVE: On 03-27-15 at approximately 2104 hours, I was
               advised of a report of the odor of marijuana emitting from room
               #1211 in Stephenson East, located at 1265 SE Stadium Way. I
               called the Hall Director on the phone, Joshua B. Mcphatter (DOB
               06-24-89), who stated that he had smelled the odor of marijuana
               coming from room #1211 in Stephenson East, at approximately
               2110 hours today. I asked Mcphatter on a scale of 1-10 how
               positive he was the odor was coming from room #1211, with 10
               being absolutely positive. Mcphatter told me "9.5 to 10". I
               asked Mcphatter on a scale of 1-10 how positive he was that the
               odor coming from room #1211 was marijuana, with 10 being
               absolutely positive. Mcphatter told me "9". I asked Mcphatter
               if he ever attended a controlled marijuana burn class conducted
               by the police department, and he said yes. Mcphatter said he
               last attended a controlled burn class conducted by Cpl. Daniels
               in the Fall of 2014. I asked Mcphatter if he has reported other
               drug incidents at Washington State University, and what were
               the results. Mcphatter told me he has probably called about 12-
               15 other times and in about 90 percent of those incidents there
               have been drugs or paraphernalia found. I asked Mcphatter how
               old the residents of room #1211 are, and he told me 19 and 18
               years old. Mcphatter identified the residents of the room as
               Ryan A. Lindsay (DOB 11-04-95) and Jonathan J. Spores (DOB 04-
               23-96). Based on this information, I applied for and was
               granted search warrant #SW032715A through Whitman County
               District Court. The telephonic warrant was granted by Judge
               Robinson and authorized the search of the residence located at
               Stephenson East room #1211. On 03-27-15 at approximately 2252
               hours Cpl. Edwards, Ofc. Olmstead, Interns Toni York, Travis
               Bogard, and I arrived at Stephenson East, room #1211 to serve
               the search warrant. I activated my Vievu camera. After I
               knocked on room #1211, a male came to the door and another male
               was inside the room. I told both males to exit the room because
               I had a search warrant for their room. The males were later
               identified as Spores and Lindsay. Spores and Lindsay were the
               only occupants in the room and are both residents of the room.

               Both Spores and Lindsay were patted down for weapons and were
               seated in the hallway, with no further incident. Spores is 18
               years old, and Lindsay is 19 years old. I read the search
               warrant to Spores and Lindsay. I told Spores and Lindsay they
               were being audio and video recorded. I read Spores and Lindsay
               their Constitutional Rights from my department issued Miranda
               Warning card. I asked both of them if they understood their
               rights, and they both said "yes". I asked both of them if they
               would be willing to speak with me now, and they both said
               "yes". I asked Spores and Lindsay if they were smoking
               marijuana in their room. They told me they had not smoked in
               their room but had smoked in a vehicle in the parking lot
               earlier. I asked both of them if there was any marijuana in the
               room, and Spores said "yes". I asked Spores if he could tell us
               where the marijuana was located in the room, and he told me by
               his desk. I asked Spores and Lindsay who the marijuana belonged
               to, and they both told me it belonged to both of them. I asked
               if there was anything else in the room I should be aware of
               before searching, and Lindsay told me alcohol. Cpl. Edwards,
               Intern York, Intern Bogard, and I entered the room and began to
               search. Cpl. Edwards and Intern Bogard searched the right side
               of the room belonging to Lindsay. Intern York and I searched
               the left side of the room belonging to Spores. Ofc. Olmstead
               stayed out in the hallway with Spores and Lindsay. Intern York
               found one (1) glass jar containing green vegetable material
               (GVM), and one (1) red plastic bong with GVM residue. These
               items were found on the ground, next to the desk on the left
               side of the room. Intern York later found one (1) green plastic
               grinder with small amounts of GVM, and one (1) blow tube with
               GVM residue. There items were found in the top left drawer of
               Spores' desk. Based on my training and experience as a police
               officer, I have been exposed to burning, burnt, and fresh
               marijuana on numerous occasions. The GVM appeared to be
               marijuana and smelled like fresh marijuana. I photographed the
               bong, glass jar with GVM, grinder, and blow tube. The
               photographs were downloaded into Spillman. I seized the bong,
               glass jar with GVM, grinder, and blow tube. They were later
               logged into evidence. The GVM inside of the glass jar was
               weighed and the weight was 3.07 grams (weight does not include
               the glass jar). Intern York found an envelope (indicia of
               residence) addressed to Spores in Stephenson East #1211. The
               envelope was found on top of the desk on the left side of the
               room. Cpl. Edwards found an envelope (indicia of residence)
               addressed to Lindsay in Stephenson East #1211. The envelope was
               found in the desk drawer on the right side of the room. Both
               items of indicia were photographed and attached to Spillman.
               There were 19 cans of beer found in the room. Along with four
               (4) 750 mL bottles mostly full with hard liquor. I had Spores
               and Lindsay dump all of their alcohol down the janitors closet
               sink around the corner from their room. I told Spores and
               Lindsay that the case would be forwarded to the Whitman County
               Prosecuting Attorney's Office for review and possible criminal
               charges. I told Spores and Lindsay I would not being forwarding
               charges for MIP, because they were polite and cooperative
               during the investigation. I gave a copy of the search warrant

               My Vievu camera was activated, and the video has been

               called Mcphatter and advised him of the results of the
               investigation. I completed a Return of Search Warrant, which
               included a disc with the audio recording of the telephonic
               search warrant application. The audio recording was also saved
               to the permanent digital evidence file on the computer. The
               Return of Search Warrant was placed into an envelope and
               delivered to Whitman County District Court. No further

               Barringer (072496) Forward MIP 2. NARRATIVE: On 032715 at
               approximately 2230 hours I was driving westbound on NE Colorado
               St near Thatuna St when I observed Chase D. Barringer (072496)
               tripping and stumbling as he walked on the south sidewalk
               towards campus. I drove around the block and got out on foot. I
               located Barringer at the corner of Thatuna St and NE Colorado.
               He was talking to 2 women and I asked if they knew him, they
               did not. I asked if I could speak with him separately and he
               said "of course". He told me he was 18 and I could smell the
               odor of intoxicants on his breath. I asked for his WADL and he
               struggled with his wallet to produce it. I then asked to look
               at his eyes and he said "of course". He had difficulty keeping
               his head still. I observed a lack of smooth pursuit in both
               eyes. He admitted to drinking beer. He refused to provide a
               breath sample. He stated he was under the influence of alcohol
               and that he was not going to lie to me. He then said I could
               suspend his license for 90 days because he did not provide a
               sample. As he moved around I began smelling the odor of
               marijuana and asked if he had any. He said he did not. I
               continued to smell it and he said he would check his pockets
               again. When he did so he found a vial of marijuana. He then
               informed me and showed valid proof that he was a medicinal
               marijuana patient. He however had brought it onto campus. I
               then informed him he was under arrest for MIP. I told him
               charges would be forwarded to the prosecutor. I stated we were
               being audio/visually recorded and that he had the right to an
               attorney. I verified he was able to go back home to the ATO
               house and told him to go home. Charges to be forwarded. Nothing
               follows. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 27th day of March, 2015, in Pullman,

               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1430 SYNOPSIS: Conducted a
               traffic stop for speed over the legal limit. The driver was
               under 21 and admitted to consuming alcohol. I conducted field
               sobriety test and determined the driver was not impaired. I
               warned the driver for MIP/MIC. Forward to student conduct.

               N./081795 Warned MIP/MIC 2. NARRATIVE: On 03/27/15 at about
               2231 I observed a vehicle driving on Orchard Dr towards Stadium
               Way at a high rate of speed. I activated my radar and the
               display showed a speed of 36 mph for the vehicle. The speed
               limit on Orchard Dr is 25 mph. I turned on the vehicle
               (WA/ARG5529) as it turned onto North Fairway Ln and then onto
               North Fairway Rd. I activated my lights and the vehicle pulled
               over on North Fairway Dr at the tennis courts. I contacted the
               driver, Tanner N. Fitzpatrick (081795). I told him the stop was
               being recorded and I asked for his driver's license, vehicle
               registration and proof of insurance. He said he left his
               driver's license at home and that he was on his way to the
               Student Recreation Center. He told me his name and date of
               birth. I could smell an odor of intoxication coming from him. I
               asked him how many drinks he had, he said he had one drink
               before leaving his apartment. I went back to my vehicle and ran
               his information through dispatch. I then returned to his
               vehicle and asked Fitzpatrick if he would step out of the
               vehicle and perform some voluntary field sobriety tests. He
               said he would and exited the vehicle. The first test I
               performed was the HGN. During the test Fitzpatrick was swaying
               but I did not see any other indicators during the test. I also
               had him perform the walk and turn and the one leg stand. I did
               not see enough indicators during these test to determine that
               Fitzpatrick was impaired. I asked him if he would provide a
               sample for the PBT. I explained it was voluntary like the other
               tests and that it did not replace the evidentiary breath test.
               Fitzpatrick said he would and provided a sample, the reading
               was .009. I explained to Fitzpatrick he was not under arrest
               for DUI or minor operating a motor vehicle after consuming
               alcohol. I told him I was going to warn him for minor consuming
               alcohol and I would be forwarding my report to student conduct.
               Fitzpatrick left his vehicle parked at the tennis courts and
               went across the street to the recreation center. Forward to
               student conduct. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1432 SYNOPSIS: Cougar Security reported
               a male and female arguing in front of Parking Services.
               Subjects were contacted and the dispute was determined to be
               verbal only. Incident forwarded to the title IX coordinator.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               03/27/15 at about 2337 hrs I heard Cougar Security advising
               Dispatch of a male and female arguing in front of WSU Parking
               Services. The male was reportedly pulling on the female's arm.
               I located the subjects walking along Cougar Way across from the
               Lower Soccer Field. I spoke to the female, later identified as
               Jordan G. Roberts (063096), who told me she and her boyfriend,
               later identified as Victor M. Mayorquin Jr. (042694), were
               arguing because she saw he was texting someone and thought it
               was another girl. She said they have some "trust issues" in
               their relationship. I asked if Mayorquin pulled/pushed/grabbed
               her by the arm and Roberts initially said he had not grabbed
               her and that it had only been a verbal argument. I spoke to
               Officer Petlovany who told me Cougar Security advised him they
               saw Roberts sitting down looking at the phone and Mayorquin
               pulling on her arm. I spoke to the Cougar Security units and
               asked if it looked like Mayorquin was trying to hurt Roberts
               when he was pulling on her or if it looked like he was trying
               to get her to leave. They said it was hard to tell but it was
               possible that Mayorquin was simply trying to get Roberts to
               leave with him. I asked Roberts again what happened when she
               was sitting down and she then said Mayorquin had grabbed her
               arm and pulled on her but that it was not anything serious. She
               said he was angry because she did not believe him. She said she
               did not feel in danger at all. I went to speak with Officer
               Whitman and I could hear Mayorquin telling Officer Whitman that
               he was pulling on Roberts' arm because he was trying to get her
               to leave because he did not want to be arguing with her in
               public. Based on what was said by Mayorquin and Roberts it did
               not appear any assault occurred that required a mandatory
               arrest. It was clear Roberts did not feel she had been
               assaulted and did not want anything to be done. Both Majorquin
               and Roberts were clearly intoxicated. I told Mayoorquin that he
               needed to go to wherever he was staying for the night and wait
               to talk to Roberts until they were both sober. Mayorquin's
               phone was returned to him and he left. I provided Roberts with
               a Domestic Violence Information packet and provided her with a
               courtesy transport to her dorm, Regents Hall. I also told her
               they should wait until they are sober to talk over their

               report of a male trespassing on the third floor of Wilmer Hall.
               Officers responded to the area and were unable to locate
               subject. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 03-28-15 at approximately 0018 hours Ofc. Olmstead and I
               were dispatched to the report of a male trespassing on the
               third floor of Wilmer Hall, located at 725 NE Thatuna St.
               Dispatch advised the complainant, Jessica R. Pruneda (DOB 06-
               21-86), said the male had left the building 10-15 minutes ago.
               Ofc. Petlovany and Ofc. Whitman tried to locate the male
               subject who was last seen walking towards Valhalla and searched
               the surrounding area. Dispatch described the subject as a
               white, male approximately 6 feet tall and about 19-20 years
               old. We were also told the male had brown curly hair with a
               diamond stud in his right cheek. The subject was wearing a grey
               Hawaiian shirt and red dress pants. Ofc. Olmstead and I arrived
               on scene, and we contacted Pruneda, the Resident Advisor on
               duty. Pruneda told us she contacted the male sitting outside of
               room #305 of Davis Hall. Pruneda said the male was hitting his
               head against the wall. Pruneda said when she questioned the
               male about being in the hall, the male stated he was waiting
               for his girlfriend. Pruneda said the male would not tell her
               his girlfriend's name. The male told Pruneda another resident
               let him in. Pruneda said the male had slurred speech and
               appeared to be intoxicated. Pruneda said she explained the hall
               rules to him, and how all guests shall be accompanied by a
               resident whenever in the building. Pruneda said the male
               eventually left the building, and she was just walking around
               to make sure he did not come back. Ofc. Olmstead and I cleared
               the scene. The subject was not located. No further action. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of

               Scott-Coman Hall. Gabriella N. Baretti (080796) and Lily E.
               Conahan (050496) were assisting/carrying Julianna K. Falk
               (032696) up the stairs. There walking was not stable and they
               were having difficulty. Once they made it to flat ground they
               separated and walked towards Coman Hall. As they turned, I got
               a better look at their faces and they appeared to be under 21.
               I said "Ladies, can you come here and talk to me?". Interns
               Lafave and Roberts were nearby and I had Baretti and Conahan
               provide their names and DOB's to them. Conahan provided the
               name of Chelsea A. Andrews (052296) and Baretti gave the name
               Taylor G. Cutrer (050296). The interns ran the names and did
               not get returns. Ofc. Whitman had arrived on scene and he
               rechecked the names. Conahan gave him the name of Chelsea M.
               Andrews (052296) and he got a valid return. Baretti gave the
               name of Taylor G. Cutrer (050196). He did not get a return. I
               first spoke with Falk who was red faced and she provided me
               with id. I checked her eyes and observed a lack of smooth
               pursuit in both eyes. I could smell the odor of intoxicants on
               her breath. She admitted to drinking and said she drank
               Burnett's which I later learned was a vodka. She provided a
               breath sample for my PBT of .233. I then spoke with Conahan who
               told me her name was Chelsea Andrews. I could smell the odor of
               intoxicants on her breath. I checked her eyes and observed a
               lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes. She admitted to drinking
               white wine. She told me she was a WWU student. Conahan provided
               me with a breath sample of .227. I then spoke with Baretti who
               told me her name was Taylor. I could smell the odor of
               intoxicants on her breath. I checked her eyes and observed a
               lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes. She said she drank wine.
               She told me her birthday was in May. It is in August. I was
               then told the returns did not come back. I asked Baretti if she
               was lying to me and she said she was not. She then provided a
               breath sample of .143. I then explained to the group that I

               would not be arresting them as they had been cooperative. I
               would just send information to Student Conduct. Baretti then
               began giving various birth dates and Falk stated "just tell the
               truth". I then asked what Baretti's full legal name was. She
               said "Gabby". She said her name was Gabby Chocano. I confirmed
               that the first name she had given was "Taylor" and that she had
               lied. She confirmed she had. We then went through several
               iterations of Gabrela M. Chocano and Gabrela M Chocano-Torres.
               We got no returns. I asked for the last 4 of her SSN and she
               stated it was 3187. It was 2565. I had her write down her name
               as it appears on her driver's license. She wrote Gabrela M.
               Chocano-Torres. The girls were all visiting Falk from out of
               town. I released Falk and Conahan to go find Baretti's id in
               the room with her permission. Baretti then said Conahan should
               not be free to go as she had lied to me too. She gave me a
               different name. I summoned Conahan back. She maintained her
               name was Chelsea several times. She finally said "Goddamn" and
               asked me to turn away while she pulled an id from her shirt. I
               did so and she provided me with a WWU id with her real name.
               Conahan said she had given a friend's name. Conahan got a
               positive return with her new information. I then placed Conahan
               under arrest for False and Misleading Statements. I told her
               she was being audio/visually recorded. I read her her rights.
               She was placed in handcuffs and sat down on the bench at the
               entrance to Coman Hall. I then spoke with Baretti who had been
               sobbing for a while. Baretti then stated that someone had taken
               naked pictures of her and that they had tried to rape her. This
               occurred in Nebraska and she said she had already testified in
               the matter. Conahan asked me to pull her skirt down as the wind
               was blowing and I did so. Falk then came back and brought her
               id which served absolutely no purpose as we already had seen
               it. Falk agreed to let me come up to her room with Baretti to
               find her identification. I released Conahan and we all went up
               to Falks room on the 3rd floor. At Falk's room I asked if I
               could come in and she said I could. Baretti then found her WADL
               that had the name of Maria G. Chocano (080796). She also handed
               me a paper legally changing her name to Gabrella N. Baretti
               (080796). I then explained I would be forwarding charges of
               False and Misleading Statements and MIP. I told her she was
               under arrest and that she was being audio/visually recorded. I
               told her she had the right to an attorney. She continued
               talking so I read her her full Miranda rights. Baretti
               continued to cry and I asked if she needed to speak with
               anyone. She declined. I told her she was free to go. I went to
               leave but Conahan wanted to talk about the process going
               forward. I cleared. Nothing follows. Charges to be forwarded. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 28th day of March, 2015, in Pullman,

               hours I was backing up Officer Petlovany as he was contacting
               three females outside of Coman Hall. Three people were walking
               past us heading towards the entrance of Coman Hall. A female in
               that group was being helped along, she appeared very
               intoxicated and was having trouble maintaining her balance. I
               asked her to stop and talked to me. I then asked her to move
               about ten feet away from the group that Officer Petlovany was
               talking to. She almost fell as we moved away from the other
               group. I asked if she had identification I could look at and
               she said "I do but its not 21". She gave me her name and date
               of birth, Jessica M. Beitner (121295). Her speech was slurred
               and she continued to have difficulties standing. I asked
               Beitner to breath into my hand she did and I could smell the
               odor of intoxicants coming from her breath. I asked Beitner if
               she would take an eye test so I could determine her level of
               intoxication. She said she would. I began the HGN and could see
               a lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes. During the test she was
               swaying so severely that I stopped the test because I was
               afraid she would fall. I explained to Beitner I was going to
               forward charges to the prosecutor for minor in public
               exhibiting the effects of alcohol, and would also being
               forwarding my report to student conduct. I asked Beitner if she
               would provide a voluntary breath sample for the PBT. She
               provided the sample to my ALCO Sensor FST (SN#102461) and it
               recorded a reading of .250. I performed the PBT in accordance
               with state toxicologist recommendations and I have been trained
               in using the ALCO Sensor FST PBT. I asked Beitner where she was
               and she said at "my dorm". I asked who the President of the
               United States is and she said George Washington. I asked her
               again and she said George Washington. Due to the high PBT
               reading and her difficulty answering my questions I asked
               dispatch to have medics sent to my location. Pullman Fire
               Department arrived and evaluated Beitner. They released her to
               a sober friend that lived in her dorm. Forward report to
               student conduct. Forward charges to prosecutor. I certify and

               hours Ofc. Olmstead and I were dispatched to a report of the
               odor of marijuana originating from Davis Hall #264, located at
               725 NE Thatuna St. Ofc. Olmstead and I arrived on scene and
               contacted several hall staff members in the hallway. I
               approached the door to room #264. I knocked on the door, and it
               was answered by Hannah M. Ruiz (DOB 10-09-95). I was unable to
               smell the odor of marijuana coming from Ruiz's room. Ruiz is
               the only resident of the room and is 19 years old. Ruiz had a
               friend in the room who was visiting from out of town, Jalen C.
               Lewis (DOB 09-27-96). Ruiz admitted to smoking marijuana
               outside on Greek Row earlier. I observed that Ruiz's eyes
               appeared to be bloodshot and glazed. Upon further
               investigation, Ofc. Olmstead and I determined that Ruiz was in
               possession of a small amount of green vegetable material (GVM)
               in two small cylinder containers. Ofc. Olmstead observed the
               GVM, which appeared to be marijuana and smelled like fresh
               marijuana. Ruiz was cooperative, and we explained to her that
               we would not be taking any enforcement action. Ruiz agreed to
               voluntarily dispose of the GVM in the nearby restroom toilet,
               which she did. Ofc. Olmstead and I cleared the scene. No
               further action. My Vievu camera was activated, and the video
               has been downloaded into the permanent digital evidence folder.
