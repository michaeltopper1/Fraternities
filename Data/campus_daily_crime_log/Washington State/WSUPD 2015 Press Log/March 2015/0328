               information passed on to WCSO Sergeant Chapman. NAME/DOB ACTION

               hrs Dispatch advised WSCO was en route to a one vehicle roll
               over collision that was reported by a third party. The third
               party advised they provided three college aged females who were
               involved in the collision with a ride to Stephenson Hall but
               did not have their names. I was able to locate the local
               responsible party for the vehicle, Taylor R. Neal (011996), and
               contacted her on the phone. She advised she was still with the
               other two females who were involved, later identified as Kristi
               A. Kelton (070496) and Teryn E. M. Nicolet (100496), at
               Stephenson South 515. I responded to Stephenson South 515 and
               contacted Nicolet, Kelton, and Neal. I could see Neal had a
               small bump/abrasion on her right temple. She advised she was ok
               and did not need any medical attention. Kelton and Nicolet
               advised they were uninjured. They told me they left Pullman at
               about 1745 or 1800 hrs and did not have any particular
               destination. They were just driving out somewhere to watch the
               sunset. Kelton was driving, Nicolet was in the front passenger
               seat, and Neal was sitting in the rear behind Nicolet. All
               three were wearing their seatbelts. Kelton said she thought she
               was going about 30 MPH around a corner when she lost control of
               the vehicle and it slid into a ditch, rolling over. Neal had
               already been in contact with her parents about the collision
               and they advised they wanted Auto Body Super Center to tow the
               vehicle. I passed all of the information regarding the tow
               preference and driver/passenger information on to WCSO Sergeant
               Chapman, who was on scene with the vehicle. I photographed
               Neal's injury and provided her with my business card and both
               WSU and WCSO case numbers. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               hours I was dispatched to a drugs call at Waller Hall room 101.
               Upon arrival I met with RED Christina Gilmore who stated room
               101 smelled strongly of marijuana. When I reached room 101 the
               odor of burnt marijuana was overpowering. I knocked on the door
               and Nathan James Hanson 07/07/96 answered. I explained the
               reason why I was called to his room and told Hanson that as
               long as he was willing to turn over all his marijuana and
               smoking devices I would only be sending this case to student
               conduct. Hanson stated he was willing to turn over his
               marijuana. Hanson retrieved two glass jars containing loose
               marijuana and two prerolled joints. Hanson had approximately
               three grams of marijuana. Hanson and I walked out to the
               dumpster where Hanson destroyed his illegal items. I explained
               the student conduct process to Hanson and told him he was free
               to go. END OF REPORT I certify and declare under penalty of

               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Catalina A. Torres 09/04/94
               Cited/Released DUI 5Z0446694 2. NARRATIVE: On March 29th, 2015
               at approximately 00017 hours I was driving eastbound on Valley
               Road near the Emerald Downs Apartments when I noticed a red
               Honda Accord traveling westbound on Valley Road approaching me.
               The Honda appeared to be traveling at a high rate of speed for
               the posted 25 MPH zone. I activated my in car radar (vehicle 4)
               and obtained a reading of 39 MPH. As soon as the Honda passed
               me I turned around to catch it. The Honda turned left onto
               Brandi Way and accelerated at a high rate of speed up the hill.
               It appeared as if the Honda was attempting to get away from me
               as I turned around. I caught up to the Honda at the top of
               Brandi Way and the Honda appeared visually to be traveling
               between 35 and 40 MPH in the 25 MPH zone. I activated my
               emergency lights and siren and the Honda quickly pulled into
               the Grove Apartments and came to a stop. I contacted the
               driver, Catalina Andrea Torres 09/04/94, identified myself,
               informed the driver I was recording, and asked why she was
               trying to get away from me. I told Torres that she had come
               over the hill very fast. Torres said, "sorry Sir." I asked for
               Torres driver's license, proof of insurance, and vehicle
               registration. Torres provided her military ID and stated she
               did not have her driver's license with her. Torres' ID
               identified her as 20 years old. I asked Torres how much she had
               to drink tonight. Torres said none. I told Torres that she did
               not sound too confident in her answer and asked her if she was
               willing to be a little more honest with me. Torres said she had
               one drink. I asked Torres if I could check her eyes and she
               stated yes. I preformed an HGN test on Torres as she sat in the
               vehicle. I told Torres to follow the tip of my finger with her
               eyes only and do not move her head. During the HGN test I
               observed equal pupil size, equal tracking, lack of smooth
               pursuit, and distinct and sustained nystagmus. About this time
               Ofc. Whitman arrived on scene. I asked Torres if she was
               willing to do some voluntary standardized field sobriety tests.
               Torres stated she would. The tests were conducted on the
               driveway into the grove which has a moderate grade to it. The
               drive way was paved and clear of debris. Torres was wearing a
               black loose fitting dress and high heels. I asked Torres if she
               would like to take her heels off for the test and Torres did
               so. Torres completed the entire tests barefoot. The sidewalk

               was lit by street lights, patrol car spot light, and personal
               flashlight. I explained to Torres that I would be evaluating
               her on how well she followed my instructions as well as how
               well she performed the tests. The first test I administered was
               the HGN test. I instructed Torres to stand with her heels and
               toes together and keep her arms at her sides. I told Torres to
               remain in that position while I administered the test. Torres
               stated she understood. I told Torres to follow the tip of my
               pen with her eyes only and not to move her head. I held my pen
               approximately 12-15 inches away from Torres's head. During the
               test I observed, equal pupil size, equal tracking, lack of
               smooth pursuit, and distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum
               deviation in both eyes. As Torres stood before me I could
               clearly smell the odor of intoxicants coming from her breath.
               The next test I administered was the walk and turn. I told
               Torres to place her left foot on an imaginary line before her.
               I then instructed Torres to place her right foot heel to toe in
               front of her left foot and keep her arms at her side. Torres
               got into the starting position as instructed. I told Torres to
               remain in that position as I gave further instructions. I told
               Torres, when I tell you to begin, don't begin until I tell you,
               you will take a series of nine heel to toe steps down the line,
               with your arms at your side, looking down at your feet, and
               counting your steps out loud. Once you reach your ninth step
               leave your lead foot planted and with your rear foot take a
               series of small steps until you are facing where you came from
               and again take nine return heel to toe steps. I demonstrated
               the test for Torres. I reminded Torres to keep her arms at her
               side, count her steps out loud, look down at her feet, and do
               not stop the test until she had completed it. I asked Torres if
               she understood and Torres said she did. I told Torres to begin.
               Instruction Phase: While demonstrating the test Torres lost her
               balance and stepped out of the starting position. Torres stood
               with her feet at shoulder length apart for the remainder of my
               demonstration. First Nine Steps: Torres took a total of 10
               steps without any errors. When Torres reached her 10th step she
               turned towards me and said, "complete." Torres did not attempt
               to do a turn or take her return 9 steps. The next test I
               administered was the One Leg Stand. I instructed Torres to
               stand with her heels and toes together and keep her arms at her
               side. I told Torres to remain in that position while I gave her
               further instructions. I told Torres, when I tell you to begin,
               don't begin until I tell you, you will raise either leg of your
               choice and raise it six inches off the ground. You must point
               your toe so the sole of your shoe is parallel with the ground.
               While pointing your toe, keep your arms at your side, leg
               straight, look down at your foot and count out loud, one
               thousand one, one thousand two, one thousand three, and so on
               until I tell you to stop. I demonstrated the test as I
               explained it. I asked Torres if she understood and she stated
               yes. I told Torres to begin whenever she was ready. Torres
               raised her right leg and began the test. Torres only raised her
               foot about two inches and started the test. As soon as Torres
               raised her foot her arms shot out from her sides for balance.
               Torres also was not looking down at her foot during the test. I

               had reminded Torres to look down but she did not do so. Torres
               counted, " 1001, 1002, 1003, 1004, 1005, 1006, 1007, 1008,
               1009, 10,000, 10, 1001, 1002, 1003, 1004, 1005, 1006, 1007,
               1008, 1009, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004." I told Torres that
               the last test I had for her was the PBT. I explained what the
               PBT was, that it was voluntary, and it did not replace the
               evidentiary breath test. I found my PBT (Alco-Sensor FST
               #16805) in working condition. Torres provided a PBT sample of
               .109. I told Torres that she was under arrest for DUI and
               handcuffed (D/L) her. I advised Torres of her right to counsel
               and told her she was being audio and video recorded. I walked
               Torres over to my patrol car where she was searched incident to
               arrest. Nothing of evidentiary value was found. I placed Torres
               in the back seat of my patrol car. I told Torres that the
               vehicle was going to be towed and wanted to know if there was
               anything in the car she wanted out of it. Torres stated she
               would like her cell phone, wallet, and shoes. Ofc. Whitman
               stayed with the vehicle and I transported Torres to Pullman
               Police Department for BAC. Upon arrival I checked the
               Datamaster and found it working properly, with the RFI antenna
               attached, the mouth tube warm to the touch, and a temperature
               within ranges. At 0044 hours I checked Torres's mouth finding
               no foreign substances. I read Torres her Constitutional Rights
               at 0043 hours. Torres stated she understood her rights and
               signed she understood her rights and decided not to exercise
               her rights. I read 0046 the Implied Consent Warning for Breath
               and Torres signed that it had been read to her at 0046 hours.
               Torres stated she was willing to provide a breath sample.
               Torres provided a breath sample of .092 at 0104 hours and
               another sample of .089 at 0107 hours. The breath test was
               administered in accordance to the methods approved by the
               Washington State Toxicologist pursuant to the Washington
               Administrative Code. I provided Torres a copy of the following
               documents: Driver's Hearing Request, Notice of
               Hearing/Conditions of Release, tow and impound form, and the
               breath test document. Torres was issued Sector Citation
               5Z0446694 for RCW 46.61.502 DUI. I explained the citation and
               provided her with her copy. Torres was finger printed and
               photographed. Torres' vehicle was impounded by Auto Body Super
               Center for 12 hours. My VieVu camera footage was uploaded to
               the department's computer. END OF REPORT I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               hours dispatch advised Cougar Security was reporting a
               intoxicated male vomiting in the Crimson Lot across from Wilmer
               Davis, located at 725 NE Thatuna St. Ofc. Olmstead and I
               arrived on scene. I contacted the male in the back seat of a
               vehicle parked in the Crimson Lot. There was vomit on the
               ground and on the rear passenger side of the vehicle. I asked
               the male to open the door so I could speak with him. The male
               identified himself as Nicholas S. Ensroth (DOB 02-05-96) by his
               Oregon Driver's License. As soon as Ensroth opened the door, he
               said "sir we're okay". Ensroth said they were just waiting for
               some friends. I asked Ensroth if he needed medics, and he said
               no. Ensroth told me that he attends school at Gonzaga. I asked
               Ensroth who was driving the vehicle, and he told me their sober
               friend was driving. Ensroth had slurred speech and I could
               smell the odor of intoxicants coming from his breath. Ensroth
               told me he was underage, but he was not driving. I told Ensroth
               I could still arrest him for MIP for being in the vehicle if I
               wanted. I told since he had a sober driver I would not be
               arresting him for MIP. Ofc. Olmstead spoke with one of

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1455 SYNOPSIS: Chorlton and Hegland
               arrested, cited, and released for MIP Exhibiting. NAME/DOB

               04/01/96 Cited/Released MIP Exhibiting 5Z0446692 NARRATIVE: On
               03/29/15 at approximately 0137 hours, Cougar Security Unit
               Matthew Pauley (CS11) advised dispatch that there were two
               males who appeared to be heavily intoxicated next to the WSU
               Parking Services Building on Colorado St. While en route CS11
               stated that one male was vomiting into the bushes. As I turned
               onto Cougar Way from Stadium Way, CS11 stated the two were now
               walking eastbound towards the Soccer Field. As I neared the
               Soccer Field I saw CS11 turn on his flashlight and illuminate
               two males on the sidewalk next to the Soccer Field. As I was
               nearing the two, I noticed both had removed their shirts. Both
               males were stumbling side to side severely as they walked. Both
               males appeared to be under the age of 21. As I started to come
               to a stop, the two attempted to put their shirts back on. Both
               were having difficulty getting them back on. I found it very
               odd for the two to have taken their shirts off since it was
               approximately 40 degrees outside. I parked a few feet away from
               the two and exited my patrol car. Ofc. Whitman also arrived on
               scene at the same time. I walked up to the two and asked if
               they had a second to talk. Both males stopped. Both males were
               later identified as Deven James Chorlton 03/19/96 and Tanner
               Glenn Hegland 04/01/96. I told the two what I had observed and
               what CS11 had reported to me. Chorlton stated they were not
               vomiting. Hegland appeared as if he was going to say it was him
               that was vomiting but then stopped talking. Both Chorlton and
               Hegland looked very familiar to me and I asked them where I
               knew them from. Both said they did not know. About that time I
               remembered that I had served a drug search warrant on their
               dorm room about two months earlier. I asked both if they had
               their ID's with them and both provided their WADL's. Chorlton
               was identified as 19 years old and Hegland was identified as 18
               years old. I first interviewed Chorlton. I asked Chorlton how
               much he had to drink tonight. Chorlton said he had a couple. I
               asked how much that was and Chorlton said three drinks with his
               last drink being about one to two hours ago. I asked Chorlton
               if I could look at his eyes and Chorlton said I could. I told
               Chorlton to stand with his heels and toes together and have his
               arms at his sides. I told Chorlton to follow the tip of my pen
               with his eyes only and keep his head still. As soon as I moved

               my pen Chorlton moved his head to follow the pen. I told
               Chorlton again to keep his head still. Chorlton told me his
               left eye was different than his right eye. I asked what was
               different and Chorlton said his left eye points to the right a
               little bit. I told Chorlton just to try his best. I attempted
               the HGN test but Chorlton was looking past my shoulder and not
               following the pen. I attempted several passes but it was clear
               that Chorlton was purposefully not following my instructions so
               I stopped the test. Chorlton's eyes were watery and bloodshot
               As Chorlton stood before me I could clearly smell the strong
               odor of intoxicants coming from Chorlton's breath. I next
               interviewed Hegland. I asked Hegland how much he had to drink.
               Hegland said about the same amount as Chorlton. I asked Hegland
               if I could look at his eyes and Hegland said I could. I told
               Hegland to stand with his heels and toes together while keeping
               his arms at his sides. I told Hegland to follow the tip of my
               pen with his eyes only and keep his head still. As soon as I
               moved my pen Hegland moved his head to follow the pen. I again
               told Hegland to keep his head still. During the test Hegland
               was swaying back and forth and after a few passes, Hegland lost
               his balance and stumbled backwards. I stopped the test at point
               so Hegland would not fall over and hurt himself. During my few
               passes I observed, equal tracking, equal pupil size, and lack
               of smooth pursuit. Hegland's eyes were bloodshot and watery. I
               could clearly smell the very strong odor of intoxicants coming
               from Hegland's breath as he stood before me. I told Hegland and
               Chorlton that they were both under arrest for MIP Exhibiting. I
               handcuffed (D/L) Hegland as Ofc. Whitman handcuffed (D/L)
               Chorlton. I advised both that they were being audio and video
               recorded. I read both their Miranda Rights off my department
               issued card. Chorlton and Hegland both stated they they
               understood their rights. Both were search incident to arrest
               and nothing of evidentiary value was found. I transported
               Chorlton and Hegland to the Pullman Holding Facility where both
               were fingerprinted and photographed. I issued Chorlton and
               Hegland Sector citations for RCW 66.44.270.2B MIP Exhibiting. I
               explained the citation to each person and provided them with
               their copies. I offered to provide both a ride home but Hegland
               refused. Both were released from custody and I cleared. END OF

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Whitman / 323 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1457 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched to a
               harassment call at Rogers Hall. Someone drew a swastika,
               penis's and several words on a room door in dry erase marker. I
               photographed the door and interviewed several people. No
               suspects or leads at this time. Investigation continues.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               03/29/15 at about 0224 hours I was dispatched to a harassment
               call at Rogers Hall on the ninth floor. The RA was reporting
               that someone had drawn a Nazi symbol on a room door on the
               ninth floor. I responded and was met in the lobby of Rogers
               Hall by the RA, Feliz Xue (042296). We went to the ninth floor
               to room 941. The resident of room 941, Vitor L. Orisini Silva
               (082985), was waiting outside of the room. He said that he
               heard voice laughing outside of his door around 0145 hours but
               did not look outside to see who was there. Later, after 0200
               hours, he exited his room to go to the bathroom to brush his
               teeth and notice someone had drawn on his door. Orisini Silva's
               roommate was not at the room when this incident occurred and
               did not return while I was there. There was a small white board
               on his door with a dry erase marker attached to it. There were
               also paper decorations on the door. Around the decorations and
               on one decoration someone had written on the door with the
               black dry erase marker. There was a swastika, two penis's and
               the words drawn on the door. I asked the RA if they had reports
               of any similar incident at Rogers Hall. He said someone had
               drawn penis's on sticky notes and put them on the walls of the
               tenth floor. Among the words written on the door was the name
               Dan written several times. I asked the RA if there was anyone
               named Dan on the floor. The room across the hall from Orisini
               Silva's was room 939 and the name on the door said Dan. The RA
               said Daniel A. Gwiazdon (070895) was the resident of room 939,
               and they had seen him earlier because he opened his door while
               they were investigating the graffiti. The RA said they only
               talked to Gwaizdon briefly because he had been asleep and only
               opened his door to see what was going on. Orisini Silva said he
               had not had any problems with Gwiazdon. I photographed the
               graffiti and gave the RA the case number. I knocked on
               Gwiazdon's door and he did not answer the door. The RA said
               some of his friends were down the hall in the lounge. I went to
               talk to them. In the ninth floor lounge I talked to Alexander
               P. Bjornstad (052495), Ethan A. Wisdom (120195), and Conor M.
               Wray (031496). They said they had been with Gwiazdon earlier
               but left when he wanted to go to sleep. They did not believe he

               would have drawn on Orisini Silva's door. They also said
               Gwiazdon had recently moved to room 939 because he had problems
               with his roommate and other people on the tenth floor of Rogers
               Hall where he used to live. I asked them if they knew who his
               old roommate was, they said his name was Evan, later identified
               as Evan M. Gates (041595), and described where his room was on
               the tenth floor. They also said Gates friends that Gwiazdon did
               not get along with were "AJ" and Andy. The RA said they had
               seen Gates and some of his friends still awake about an hour
               earlier so I decided to attempt to contact them. I went up to
               the tenth floor and was about to knock on his door when Aditya
               A. Joglekar (112096) came out of room 1033. I asked if he was
               "AJ", he said he was. I asked him if he knew anything about the
               graffiti and he said he did not. I then knocked on Gates's room
               and he came to the door. I talked to him and he said he did not
               know anything about the graffiti and said he had not had any
               problems with Gwiazdon since he moved out. I did not interview
               anyone else at that time, and cleared the scene. No suspects or
               leads at this time, investigation continues. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               29th day of March, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.
