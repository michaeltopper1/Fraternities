               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1114 03/06/15 SYNOPSIS: Welfare check on
               a WSU employee. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On March 6, 2015 at about 1328 hours I was
               dispatched to a welfare check. I contacted the complainant,
               Bonnie Wilmoth, WSU Human Resources at her office. Wilmoth told
               me WSU Human Resources was just advised of a female employee
               who may have tried to commit suicide at work yesterday by
               attempting to jump off of a 4th floor balcony. Wilmoth said
               other employees "tackled" the female and prevented her from
               jumping. The coworkers then called the female's husband who
               came and picked her up from work. There were no reports to 911
               of such an incident yesterday, Thursday, March 5, 2015. Wilmoth
               said HRS was not notified of the alleged incident until this
               afternoon. WSU HRS would like a welfare check done on the
               employee as she did not show up for work today and has not
               contacted her department. Wilmoth identified the employee as
               Nancy Kumpula-McWhirter. Kumpula-McWhirter is employed by WSU
               as a Associate in Research; Veterinary Microbiology &
               Pathology. According to the WSU web site she has an office in
               Bustad 374. It is unknown where the incident may have taken
               place. Wilmoth did not have any information on location. I
               asked Colfax Police Department for an agency assist as Kumpula-
               McWhirter's address is in Colfax, WA. Colfax Police went to the
               address but were unable to make contact with anyone. I tried to
               call the phone number listed in Spillman for Kumpula-McWhirter.
               The phone rang a couple of times and then went to a fast busy
               signal. I was not able to leave a message. At about 1500 hours
               I called Wilmoth's work number and left her a message regarding
               the attempts made trying to check the welfare of Kumpula-
               McWhirter. No further investigation at this time. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               6th day of March, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               hrs I was backing Sergeant Griffin on a traffic stop on Campus
               St. at Veterans Way when I noticed a male, later identified as
               Benjamin B. Schoedel (022895), who was walking along Campus St.
               eastbound. Schoedel caught my attention because he appeared to
               be under the age of 21 and was having difficulty walking,
               stumbling side to side. Schoedel stumbled up to the doors to
               the Hillside Dining Center and tried to get into the building
               but was unable to do so. He then ran eastbound to the end of
               Wilmer Hall and it appeared he was going to try and get in the
               building again. I contacted Schoedel on the stairs to the east
               entrance of Wilmer Hall. Schoedel was swaying as he stood so I
               asked him to come down the stairs because I did not want him to
               fall down the stairs. He came down the stairs and nearly fell
               off a platform at the base of the stairs. I directed him to sit
               on the stairs so he would not fall over and he said, "I'm
               fucked up", referring to his high level of intoxication.
               Schoedel was highly intoxicated and I could smell a strong odor
               of intoxicants on his breath as I spoke with him. Schoedel told
               me he lived at "sig eps" meaning the Sigma Phi Epsilon
               fraternity. I asked how much he had to drink and he said he had
               been drinking a type of rum and had several glasses. I asked
               how old he was and he initially said 21. I asked for his name,
               which he provided. When I asked for his date of birth he
               repeatedly gave me his name or would say 2015. He eventually
               gave me his date of birth, 022895, which I confirmed through
               Dispatch. The information provided indicated Schoedel was under
               21. I asked Schoedel if there was someone he could call to come
               get him and he started to fumble with his phone to try and call
               someone but it was clear he was not going to be able to do
               that. I advised him he was under arrest for MIP Exhibiting and
               placed him in handcuffs (double locked). I advised him he was
               being audio and video recorded and read him his constitutional
               rights from a pre-printed card. He verbally waived his rights.
               I asked if he would submit to a breath test and he said no. I
               completed criminal citation #5Z0173312 for MIP exhibiting for
               Schoedel. I provided Schoedel with a courtesy transport to his
               fraternity where I explained his citation to him, he received
               his copy, and was released. I escorted Schoedel to the entrance
               of his fraternity and made sure there was someone there who

               contacted them at the crosswalk near Bohler Gym. I told them I
               needed to speak with and they complied. I explained why they
               could not be in the roadway and was rather surprised they had
               not scene me as I they had ridden by me on Thatuna. Each
               appeared to have watery eyes and appeared to be under 21. They
               admitted to consuming alcohol and I observed a a lack of smooth
               pursuit in each of their eyes. They admitted to consuming
               alcohol. I told them they had been cooperative and did not feel
               they were significantly intoxicated. I told them I would only
               be giving them a warning. They each provided a breath sample
               with my promise of not recording the resulting numbers in my
               written report but knowing it would be on video. Both provided
               a positive result. They were free to go. I cleared. I certify

               03/07/15 at about 0041 hrs Dispatch advised hall staff at
               Gannon Hall was reporting the odor of marijuana coming from
               room 104. I responded and upon arrival could not detect an odor
               of marijuana coming from room 104. I knocked on the door
               several times but received no answer. I could hear movement and
               shuffling coming from room 106. As I was preparing to leave
               hall staff advised the odor could have been coming from room
               106 too as they were having difficulty narrowing it down before
               my arrival. I smelled the crack of the door at room 106 and
               could smell a strong odor of burnt incense with a very slight
               odor of marijuana. I knocked on the door and a male, later
               identified as Wisam S. Nakour, answered the door. I asked who
               else was in the room and Wisam said his cousin, Mulham A.
               Nakour, who was just visiting. I could see what I recognized to
               be a marijuana grinder on the desk in the room. I told Wisam I
               was there because the odor of marijuana was reported and it was
               determined to be coming from his room. He denied having
               marijuana. I pointed out the grinder I could see on the desk
               and asked what was in it. He opened it and said nothing. I
               asked to see it and he handed it to me. I opened the grinder
               and observed trace amounts of marijuana inside. I told Wisam he
               had two options, he could retrieve all his illegal items and we
               would go outside and destroy them. The other option was I could
               seize his room as evidence and he and Mulham would be free to
               go but could not remain in the room. I told him I would apply
               for a search warrant, which the judge may or may not grant. I
               told him if the search warrant was granted I would search his
               room and any items found would be dealt with through student
               conduct as well as the court. Wisam chose to retrieve his
               marijuana and produced one small bud of marijuana. I handed him
               back the grinder and escorted him outside where he disposed of
               the items. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 07 day of March,

               03/07/15 at about 0050 hours I contacted three individual who
               were walking near the construction site on Cougar Way. They
               were walking three abreast and the male closest to the center
               of the roadway was staggering a little bit. I asked if they saw
               the sign advising them to cross the street since the sidewalk
               was fenced off due to construction. They said they did not. I
               asked if they had been drinking and they said they had not. I
               asked if they would do an eye test so I could see if they had
               been drinking. They said they would. I began the HGN on
               Nordquist I saw four of the six clues during the test. I asked
               them again if they had been drinking and they said they had
               not. I told Nordquist that due the clues I saw during the HGN I
               could tell he had been drinking. Nordquist and the other two
               then admitted to drinking alcohol earlier, and they admitted
               they were under 21. I asked if I could see their identification
               and they provided them or gave me their name and date of birth.
               I did HGN on Heath, and Demarco they both showed signs of
               intoxication. While Demarco was performing the test he was also
               swaying from side to side. They had no previous contact for
               alcohol offenses so I said I would be giving them a warning. I
               asked if the would provide a sample to the PBT to see what
               level they were at and they said they would. Nordquist PBT
               reading was .105, Heath PBT reading was .085 and Demarco PBT
               reading was .151. I explained again I was only warning them,
               and told them they were free to go. Nothing further. I certify

               1. Aldawsari, Abdullah S. A./062181 Forwarded DWLS 3rd 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 03/07/15 at about 0109 I I observed a vehicle
               traveling east on North Fairway Dr. I activated my Speed
               Measuring Device in moving mode. The SMD emitted a steady high
               pitched audio tone. I saw no other obstructions between my
               location and the vehicle when I obtained the reading. The SMD
               displayed a speed of 27 mph for the vehicle. At the time of the
               reading, the vehicle was alone. The posted speed limit on North
               Fairway Dr is 20 MPH. I turned and activated my emergency
               lights. The vehicle pulled over to the side of the road, and I
               contacted the driver. I informed the driver the stop was being
               recorded and asked for his license, registration and proof of
               insurance. The driver, Abdullah S A Aldawsari (062181), said he
               left his wallet at home. He said he had a driver's license from
               Saudi Arabia and a Ohio identification card. I wrote down his
               name and date of birth and returned to my vehicle. I asked
               dispatch to run Aldawsari through Ohio. Dispatch advised
               Aldawsari was suspended in Ohio and was not licensed in
               Washington. I went back up and asked Aldawsari to step out the
               vehicle. Aldawsari handed me his Ohio identification that he
               found in his jacket pocket. I took the ID and he stepped out of
               his vehicle. I told Aldawsari he was under arrest for driving
               while his license was suspended. I handcuffed him (DL), and
               Officer Boyd informed him he was being recorded and read him
               Miranda warnings. Aldawsari asked Officer Boyd to read them
               again and he did. I placed Aldawsari in the back of my vehicle.
               As I began to write Aldawsari a citation for DWLS 3rd Officer
               Boyd was helping Aldawsari find a friend that could come and
               pick him up and drive the vehicle. Aldawsari was able to
               contact a friend and that friend agreed to come and drive the
               vehicle. Aldawsari then told Officer Boyd he and his wife were
               flying back to Saudi Arabia in a week for the birth of their
               twins. He said he would not be returning to the area until
               August. Aldawsari was very cooperative with me during the
               entire traffic stop. At this point I voided the citation and
               explained to Aldawsari that instead of citing him, I was going

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1135 SYNOPSIS: Report of a subject
               passed out in the lounge on the 1st floor of Coman Hall.
               Subject was released to a sober friend. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 03/07/15 at about 0157 hrs
               Dispatch advised of a report from hall staff at Coman Hall that
               they found a male subject unconscious in the 1st floor lounge.
               I responded and upon my arrival found a male, later identified
               as Blane R. Behrent (051995), unconscious on the couch in the
               1st floor lounge of Coman Hall. I attempted to wake Behrent by
               performing a sternum rub and he roused briefly before going to
               sleep again. I removed Behrent's wallet from his back pocket to
               retrieve his driver's license so I could identify him. I
               attempted to wake Behrent again and was eventually successful
               at getting him to wake up and sit up on the couch. He told me
               he was visiting a friend and initially said the friend, Hunter
               R.A. Wish (072695), lived in Coman Hall. I had Behrent call
               Wish and I spoke to him briefly. Wish said he would come and
               get Behrent. Pullman Ambulance arrived on scene and evaluated
               Behrent. It was determined he was not in need of medical
               attention and they cleared. I had Behrent call Wish again to
               see where he was. It was then that I found out Wish actually
               lived in some apartments nearby. I warned Behrent he could be
               arrested for trespassing because he was in a building
               uninvited. I waited with Behrent at the entrance to Coman Hall
               for Wish to arrive. Behrent was released to Wish. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 07 day of March, 2015, in Pullman,

    Narrative: RVWD:MJG/309 / OFC: Whitman / 323 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY
               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1136 SYNOPSIS: Report of a female
               who was assaulted on Cougar Way near the Regents parking lot.
               The suspect left in a red Volvo. Unable to locate suspect, no
               leads. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               03/07/15 at about 0227 hours dispatch advised someone was
               harassing a female on Cougar Way near the Regents parking lot.
               The reporting party said the suspect left in a red Volvo headed
               towards Stadium Way and the SRC. I searched North Fairway Dr to
               the SRC and Orchard Ln as well and was unable to locate the
               suspect vehicle. Sergeant Griffin and Officer Boyd continued to
               search the are for the vehicle. Dispatch advised the reporting
               party and the victim were at the Perham Hall Lobby, and the
               reporting party was becoming agitated and disconnected the
               call. I went to the Perham Hall Lobby and talked to the victim.
               She said the reporting party had just left. I asked her if she
               would mind staying in the lobby while I went and attempted to
               talk to the reporting party, she said she would. I went outside
               and saw a male at the crosswalk on Stadium Way. I asked if he
               would talk to me, he said he would. I explained we had officers
               in the area looking for the suspect vehicle. I asked him what
               happened. The male became very belligerent, saying that we were
               not doing our jobs. Saying that the female was assaulted and we
               were doing nothing to protector her. I attempted to calm him
               down and talk to him and he continued to be belligerent and not
               answer my questions. The male walked away. I went back to the
               Perham Hall Lobby and talked to the victim, Fatou S. Bojang
               (072897). I asked her what happened. She said she was walking
               on the sidewalk on Cougar Way near the Regents parking lot when
               a male approached her. She said the male said he knew her, she
               said she did not recognize him. He then grabbed her right arm
               above the elbow. Fatou said the reporting party and the suspect
               then began to argue and the suspect went to a red vehicle and
               left. She described the suspect as an African American male
               about 5'10" wearing a red sweatshirt and a baseball hat. She
               said he had braces on his teeth. I asked if he was driving the
               vehicle and she said someone was in the drivers seat of the
               vehicle while the assault occurred and the suspect was a
               passenger when the vehicle left. There were no marks on her
               arm. I explained I would be writing up my of the assault and
               asked her to contact me if she saw the suspect or thought of
               anything else that would help identify him. I gave her my card
               with the case number for the incident. A Pullman Police Officer
               advised he had contact with a red Volvo last month. I will
