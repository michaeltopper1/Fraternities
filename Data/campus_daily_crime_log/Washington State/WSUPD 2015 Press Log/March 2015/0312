               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 031215
               at approximately 1218 hours, I was dispatched to contact Sarah
               A. Robbins regarding a hit and run collision. Upon contact,
               Robbins told me the following. At approximately 0850 hours, she
               parked her 2011 Subaru Impreza in the 2nd tier from NE N.
               Fairway Road of the yellow parking lot near Beasley Coliseum.
               At approximately 1145 hours, she returned to her vehicle and
               noticed there was damage to her rear driver's side door that
               spanned to the driver's door. Robbins stated there was white
               paint transfer scratches and marks in the door, but there
               didn't appear to be any dents. She emailed me some pictures of
               the damage to her vehicle. She stated that when she parked
               there, she didn't park next to any white vehicles. Robbins has
               no idea who may have caused the damage to her car. I checked
               the pictures and estimated the damage at approximately
               $1200.00. I provided her with the case number and downloaded
               the pictures to spillman. No suspects or leads. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of

               Unknown NARRATIVE: On March 12, 2015 at about 1304 hours I was
               dispatched to a hit and run collision that occurred earlier in
               the week. The complainant, Kjell E. Hansen (09/16/77) wanted
               telephone contact. I called Hansen and spoke with him about the
               incident. Hansen told me he just needed a case number for
               insurance purposes. His insurance company wouldn't process the
               claim without a police report. I did not see the damage to his
               vehicle. I have documented only as I was told by him on the
               telephone. No police were called to the scene at the time of
               the incident. Hansen said his vehicle was parked in the CUE
               parking garage near the top level on Monday, March 9, 2015 at
               about 1000 hours. When he returned at about 1100 hours an
               unknown passerby told him an unknown female driver had struck
               his parked Subaru. Hansen found an note left on his vehicle. He
               said it read "Bumped your car 360-281-9075." Hansen said there
               was some damage to the driver's side rear bumper. He did not
               call the number. Hansen gave the number to his insurance
               company and let them handle the claim. I provided Hansen with
               the case number. No further investigation. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               windows rolled up at ADBF. Owner contacted. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On March 12, 2105 at
               about 1545 hours I was dispatched to a dog in a vehicle at
               ADBF. I responded to the parking lot and located the yellow lab
               in a vehicle. The windows were rolled up and the vehicle was
               parked in direct sun. The outside temperature was 61 degrees
               Fahrenheit according to my temperature gauge on my patrol
               vehicle. The dog was barking and seemed visibly upset. He was
               panting moderately. His tongue was sticking out of his mouth
               about an inch. I could see saliva dripping off of the end of
               the tongue. The owner soon appeared on scene. I identified him
               as Randall A Dickinson (03/25/92). I educated Dickinson on
               leaving a dog in a car. He claimed that he had been gone for
               only 5 minutes. The dog and owner drove away after our
               conversation. The dog did not need medical attention. I also
               made contact with the complainant who was on scene. She claims
               that the dog was left for about 20 to 25 minutes. No further
               investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 12th day of March, 2015, in
               Pullman, Washington. _______________________________________

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: ENW/328 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1235 SYNOPSIS: Request to investigate a
               possible harassment. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 031215 around 1600 hrs Cpl Daniels asked me to
               look into a possible harassment case at the request of Zami
               Wilson of Human Resource Services. The incident in question had
               occurred earlier in the day in the Political Science Office
               between Kelly B Demand (090994) and Bonnie J Kemper (122853).
               After speaking with Daniels I contacted Zami Wilson and was
               told the following. Wilson explained she had been made aware of
               an incident which had occurred in the Political Science Office
               in Johnson Tower between Kemper and Demand. According to
               Wilson, Kemper had come into a meeting in the morning and had
               made a comment along the lines of "a lot of people are going to
               go down and maybe some innocent ones." Wilson went on to tell
               me this comment was made in front of several people, to include
               Demand, Teresa F Woolverton (080959), and Michael D Goldsby
               (040170). According to Wilson, Demand took this comment as a
               possible threat when combined with an incident which occurred
               later in the morning where Kemper was speaking with Demand in
               the office of the Political Science Department. During this
               conversation Kemper's voice was raised to the point where
               Woolverton and exited her office to see what was going on in
               addition to a custodian entering the office to tell Kemper she
               could be heard down the hallway. Kemper responded to the
               custodian and said something along the lines of "I don't give a
               fuck." Shortly after this Kemper collected her things and left
               work for the remainder of the day. I thanked Wilson for the
               information and told her I would look into this and let her
               know what I learned. After concluding my call with Wilson I
               contacted Demand and spoke with her regarding this incident and
               was told the following. Demand explained there has been some
               confusion and tension in the office over Kemper's retirement
               and her taking over. This tension has come about over Kemper
               trying to train Demand on what her duties are and lead to a
               conversation with her direct supervisor, Dr. Preston, on
               031115. During a meeting prior to 0800 hrs with Woolerton, and
               Michael D Goldsby (040170) Kemper walked in and grabbed a cup
               of coffee before Woolerton made a comment about her appearing
               cocky. Kemper responded to the comment by saying something to
               the extent of "a lot of people are going to go down and maybe
               some innocent ones too." Demand took note of the comment and
               believed it to have possibly been a threat directed at her.
               Following the meeting Goldsby had left and Kemper and Demand

               were in the break room area at which point Kemper began yelling
               at her. Demand explained this caused enough of an issue that a
               custodian came in and told Kemper she could be heard down the
               hall. Kemper responded to the custodian by saying she "didn't
               give a fuck." Shortly after this Kemper collected her
               belongings and left the office for the day. Demand and I
               continued to speak about this incident during which time she
               told me she felt very uncomfortable in the situation and
               believes the comment may have been a threat. We spoke about
               different options for her safety to include contacting the
               police if she felt things were escalating to that point again
               in the future. We concluded our conversation a short time later
               at which point I spoke with Goldsby regarding the meeting and
               was told the following. Goldsy explained he had only been there
               for a short period of time before heading to a class along with
               his teaching assistant. While he was there he told me he did
               see Kemper come into the room. He went on to tell me
               Woolverton, Demand, and he were in the room. As Bonnie entered
               the room he told me he heard her comment, similar to what
               Demand had told me earlier. He went on to say he didn't take it
               as a threat and believed Kemper was irritated prior to making
               the comment. When asked about the comment he went on to tell me
               he took it as an off handed comment, but not a threat. Shortly
               after this he left along with his teaching assistant for a
               class. When he returned around 0800 Kemper was gone and he
               heard about the incident which had occurred following prior to
               her leaving for the day, but added he had no direct knowledge
               of the incident itself. I thanked him for his time before
               contacting Woolerton who told me the following. Woolerton
               explained Kemper had arrived around 0745 hrs and appeared like
               something was wrong. She went on to tell me she had made a
               comment to her along the lines of "feeling a little cocky
               today?" Kemper then responded with the comment Demand and
               Goldsby had described to me. Around 0900 hrs Woolerton told me
               she heard yelling from the main office, which was where Kemper
               and Demand were. She went on to tell me she had been in her
               office at this point and as she exited her office she heard
               Kemper saying "I don't give a fuck!" Following the comment
               Kemper left for the day. I asked her about the comment made
               earlier and she told me after thinking about it she didn't feel
               comfortable. She went on to tell me she has had issues with
               Kemper previously, but has dealt with her directly and doesn't
               let Kemper push her around. Woolerton also added she has the
               ability to leave the area and go to her office to defuse the
               situation, where Demand does not have that ability. I thanked
               her for her time after which I spoke with Kemper regarding this
               case. Kemper explained she had been upset prior to coming into
               work over the meeting with Dr. Preston on 031115. She continued
               and explained she was frustrated and confused over what they
               wanted from her. When I asked what she meant by this she
               explained the following. Kemper is planning on retiring in May
               and Demand is going to be taking over her duties. As a result
               she was asked to train Demand on her job, then some time later
               told she wasn't allowed to train Demand, before being told to
               again train her but in a different way. She continued and

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
               explained this has caused a certain amount of frustration. When
               Kemper arrived at the office around 0745 hrs she told me
               Woolerton made a comment about her feeling cocky. In response
               to the comment she told me she made a snide remark, but did not
               immediately tell me what it was. When I asked her about it
               again she told me that she probably said something along those
               lines. I asked her what happened from there and she told me the
               frustration continued and her and Demand were having a
               conversation where she had a raised voice. She described Demand
               as trying to get her to calm down and tell her everything would
               be ok before the custodian entered and made a comment about her
               voice being raised. When I asked her what her response was she
               admitted to saying what Demand and Woolerton had previously
               told me. Shortly following this she told me she realized she
               shouldn't be at the office and went home for the day after
               notifying her supervisor. Around this point I asked Kemper, who
               was crying at this point what else was going on and if she was
               all right. She told me she felt bad about how she had acted and
               went on to tell me she was under a tremendous amount of stress.
               She went on to explain she was having issues involving her 18
               year old daughter along with trying to plan her upcoming
               wedding, in addition to the issues at work. She admitted she
               has not been dealing with these issues well and and needs some
               help, but doesn't know where to get it. At hearing this I asked
               her if she had considered seeing someone for help. She told me
               she had thought about it, but did not know where to even begin
               to look for help. As we continued to speak Kemper began to cry
               again and I asked her again if she was all right. We spoke for
               some time about her seeking counseling and the resources
               available to her as an employee. This seemed to make her feel
               better at which point told me she feels bad about how she has
               handled things and her upcoming meeting with Wilson on 031315.
               We continued to discuss these issues after which I again
               reminded her of the resources available to her and told her.
               She thanked me for speaking with her and we concluded our
               conversation a short time later. Following my conversation with
               Kemper I emailed Wilson regarding what I had learned before
               clearing this call. Nothing further. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               12th day of March, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               POLICE DEPARTMENT ** COLLISION REPORT ** CASE #: 15-W1237
               SYNOPSIS: Report of a two car non injury backing collision in
               the Student Recreation Center parking lot. Both parties
               exchanged information. DRIVER 1: Okocha, Michelle E (071693)

               WITNESS(ES): NARRATIVE: On 031215 around 1722 hrs I was
               dispatched to a report of a two car non injury collision in the
               Student Recreation Center (SRC) parking lot. Upon my arrival I
               contacted a female, later identified as Taylor B Murphy
               (061695), who told me the following. Murphy explained she had
               pulled into the SRC parking lot and was looking for a parking
               spot. She went on to tell me she was behind a black in color
               Volkswagon Jetta (Ca. 7CUB317) when it began to back up and
               struck the front bumper of her vehicle (Wa. AFX6005). As we
               continued to speak I asked her where the vehicles were parked
               and she pointed to both vehicles. I looked at the damage to
               Murphy's vehicle, which appeared to be paint transfer but no
               significant body damage. I estimated the damage to be around
               $70.00 and asked where the other driver was. Murphy explained
               the other driver, later identified as Michelle E Okocha
               (071693) had gone inside the SRC to teach a class. I asked her
               to get Okocha and upon her return obtained her information and
               asked her what had happened. Okocha's version of the event was
               similar to Murphy's. She added after pulling into the lot and
               finding a parking spot she had checked her rear view mirror
               before proceeding to back up. Okocha explained before she began
               to back up she had not seen Murphy's vehicle before Murphy had
               hit the horn and startled her. Shortly after this her vehicle
               had rolled into the front end of Murphy's vehicle. After
               speaking with both Murphy and Okocha I instructed both parties
               to exchange information. Both parties were provided with my
               business card and case number for reference. I asked both
               individuals if they had any questions before clearing, which
               they did not. Upon my return to the WSU Police Department I
               downloaded the photos taken of both vehicles to the case file
               and completed the necessary paperwork. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 12th day of March, 2014 in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer

               of the ETRL. I was asked to contact the reporting party, later
               identified as Soumik Banerjee (022880), who told me the
               following. Banerjee explained he had been in a seminar in room
               101 of the ETRL earlier and had his Dell Laptop computer and
               brown leather bag with him. Following the seminar he left and
               upon his return to his residence he realized he did not have
               his laptop or bag with him. Banerjee asked if I could check the
               room for the computer and I told him I could do that. Upon my
               arrival I found a bag similar to the one described by Banerjee
               and upon powering up the laptop found the screen locked with
               his name. I contacted Banerjee and told him I believe I had
               found his property and arranged to meet him at his residence.
               Banerjee, who was identified by his Washington State Drivers
               License, identified the items I had located as belonging to

               and contacted the two residents of the room. They collected and

               NARRATIVE: On 03/12/15 at about 2123 hours I was dispatched to
               a drugs call at Goldsworthy Hall room 432. The RED could smell
               the odor of marijuana coming from the room. I asked dispatch if
               there was recent history at that room related to drugs.
               Dispatch advised there was a drugs call at Goldsworthy room 432
               on 03/07/15 (case # 15-W1128). I read that case and Officer
               Tiengo and Officer Olmstead had been called to the room for an
               odor of marijuana. They smelled a faint odor and no one
               answered the door when they knocked. I called the RED and asked
               her if they had contacted the residents of room 432 for the
               odor of marijuana before. She said they had and referred to the
               call on 03/07. I asked her how sure she was it was an odor of
               marijuana coming from the room. She said 7 on a scale from 1 to
               10. Sergeant Griffin and I responded to Goldsworthy Hall and
               contacted the RED. She pointed out room 432. I smelled the area
               around the door jam. I could smell a faint odor of marijuana. I
               knocked on the door and Jason E. Lawton (101895) answered the
               door. I asked if he was the resident of the room and he said he
               was. There was another male in the room, his roommate Griffin
               T. Gish (121795). I asked Lawton if he knew why we were there.
               He said he had some smoking tobacco and thought that may be why
               we were there. I said it was because of the odor of marijuana
               coming from the room. He said he had smoked the last of his
               marijuana outside earlier and thought that may be what I was
               smelling. I asked how old they were, both said they were
               nineteen. I asked if either of them had a medical marijuana
               card, they both said they did not. I explained there were two
               options. Option one was they could collect all of the
               marijuana, drug paraphernalia and other drugs in the room and
               dispose of them. The second option would be that I could apply
               for a search warrant and if granted I would search their room.
               I explained I would also be forwarding my report to student
               conduct. Lawton said he would collect the items from his room
               and dispose of them. He retrieved a small plastic bottle with
               some marijuana residue in it and said that was it. Sergeant
               Griffin asked if there was any other drug paraphernalia in the

               his bed. He said he also had a pipe. I asked if there was
               anything else in the room. Lawton said he also had a marijuana
               grinder and one can of beer. Lawton collected in total 2 bongs,
               1 pipe, 1 can of beer, a marijuana grinder and a small plastic
               container with marijuana residue. Gish stated that he does not
               smoke marijuana and none of the items were his. I followed
               Lawton to the dumpster outside of Goldsworthy Hall and observed
               him destroy the items. When Lawton took apart the marijuana
               grinder there was marijuana inside of it. All items were
               destroyed. I again explained to Lawton that I would be sending
               my report to student conduct. I asked if he had any questions,
               he said he did not. Warned. Forward to student conduct. I
