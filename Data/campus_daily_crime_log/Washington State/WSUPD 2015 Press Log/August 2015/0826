               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 08-26-15 at approximately 0912
               hours I was dispatched to the report of suspicious telephone
               calls being received at the Academic Media Center at the
               Holland Library, located at 1400 NE Terrell Mall. Dispatch
               advised they have been receiving multiple phone calls from a
               406 area code asking about their code officers. I arrived on
               scene. I contacted the complainant, Matthew P. Kyllo (DOB 06-
               21-83), in the Academic Media Center at the Holland Library.
               Kyllo told me they have been receiving several phone calls from
               the same female who calls and asks about their "safety
               officers". He said whenever the female caller on the other end
               is put on hold, she usually hangs up before they take her off
               hold. I asked if the caller is rude and uses abusive or foul
               language towards them, and he said no. Kyllo told me the female
               sounds like a normal person. I asked when she started calling,
               and he said they received the first call on 08-19-15 around
               noon. He said the last call they received was on 08-26-15 at
               0855 hours. Kyllo mentioned she asked to be put in touch with
               someone that works at the university, but provided a name of
               someone that does not work here. When they told the female
               nobody by that name works at the university, she said she would
               call back later with another name. I asked Kyllo if they have
               told the female to stop calling, and he said no. Kyllo provided
               me with a piece of paper that had the number she was calling
               from: (425) 292-5010. I told Kyllo I would call the number to
               see what was going on. I cleared the scene. I called the phone
               number at about 0948 hours, but there was no answer. It went
               straight to a voicemail with a male's voice that said thanks
               for calling "AFS" and to leave the name of my company and phone
               number and they would call back. I left a voicemail asking for
               them to return my phone call. I searched the Internet to see if
               there were other scams listed from this number, but there were
               none. I looked up "AFS" and it looks like it returns to a
               website for exchange student programs. On their website they
               had something listed about "Duty Officers". I called Kyllo back
               and told him I left a voicemail for the number. I told him it's
               possible the person is just accidentally contacting the wrong
               department. I told him to please have the person clarify what

               also provided him with my phone number and told him they could

               reported coming from room 1225 Stephenson South. Two subjects
               contacted and warned for possession of marijuana. They
               voluntarily agreed to destroy their mutual drugs. Computer

               082615 at approximately 1555 hours, I was dispatched to a
               report of marijuana coming from room 1225. Upon arrival, I
               knocked on the door and contacted Dixon and Howard. I explained
               to both of them that I was recording and that we were there for
               the odor of marijuana coming from their room. I asked both to
               step into the hallway and they complied. I explained that there
               were two options in handling the situation. I explained option
               1 was that they could voluntarily go into their room and get
               all items of drugs, paraphernalia and any other illegal
               substances and they could destroy them. Following destruction,
               their names would be sent to WSU Student Standards and
               Accountability. Option 2 was that I would seize their room,
               apply for a search warrant, and if it was granted search their
               room. I explained that if any illegal items were located during
               a search, I would deal with them accordingly and they could
               face criminal charges and possibly arrest. Both Dixon and
               Howard agreed they wanted option 1. They both went in their
               room and gathered several items of paraphernalia including
               bongs, pipes, grinders, empty mason jars with marijuana residue
               and a small pill bottle with a small amount of GVM inside it. I
               escorted Dixon to the dumpster where he destroyed their items.
               I explained to Dixon that they were both being forwarded to
               student conduct for a violation of the student conduct code and
               that they would received something from student conduct office
               in the mail. Dixon told me he understood. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 26th day of August, 2015, in Pullman,

               a wallet, phone, and keys at the CUB. Due to his intoxication
               the information may not be accurate. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 0826215 at approximately 2151
               hours Intern York contacted me at the CUB and informed me of a
               highly intoxicated male. I located Reece G. Vallee (110993) on
               the main floor. I had met Vallee recently at an elevator alarm
               and recalled he was over 21. He was visibly intoxicated and had
               to concentrate to walk. He said he had lost his wallet maybe 30
               minutes before. We were at Cougfest and checked with staff to
               see if it had been turned in. We also checked the bathroom he
               had recently been in. I provided Vallee with his case number
               and my business card. He then said he may have also lost his
               keys, phone, and a backpack. He may have left it at the
               entrance to the ballroom, which we checked. I told him to email
               me on the following day so I could get more accurate
               information from him once he sobered up. Case pending. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 26th day of August, 2015, in Pullman,

               Exhibiting 2. NARRATIVE: On 08/26/15 at about 2358 hrs I was
               driving eastbound on Campus St. passing Community Duncan Dunn
               Hall when I noticed a male, later identified as Alex R. Bowlin
               (121396), who was walking in the alleyway between Community
               Duncan Dunn and Wilmer Davis Halls. He caught my attention
               because he appeared to be under the age of 21 and was
               staggering side to side as he walked. I stopped and contacted
               Bowlin on the sidewalk along Campus St. I asked where he was
               going and he said Hillside, pointing at the Hillside dining
               center. I asked how much he had to drink and he said, not a
               lot. Bowlin told me he was 18. When I asked for ID he said he
               did not have any ID. I noticed a bulge in his back pocket and
               asked him to take out his wallet. He did so and then provided
               me with his driver's license, which confirmed he was under 21.
               I asked if I could check his eyes and Bowlin agreed. I
               attempted to administer a horizontal gaze nystagmus test on him
               but Bowlin was not able to follow my directions and keep his
               head still during the test. Bowling swayed in a circular motion
               as he stood. Bowlin agreed to provide a breath sample on a PBT
               and provided a sample of .271. As I spoke with Bowlin I could
               smell the odor of intoxicants on his breath. I advised Bowlin I
               would be referring the incident to student conduct. I escorted
               Bowlin to his room in Honors Hall. Upon our arrival at his room
               I contacted one of his roommated, Jackson D. Mills (071797),
               who agreed to keep an eye on Bowlin for the night. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 27 day of August, 2015, in Pullman,

               hrs I was driving westbound on Campus St. from B St. when I
               noticed a male, later identified as Riley C. Haub-Mcelreath
               (022596), who was walking westbound along Campus St. toward
               Spokane St. Haub-Mcelreath caught my attention because he
               appeared to be under 21 and was staggering side to side as he
               walked. I contacted Haub-Mcelreath on the corner of Campus and
               Spokane Streets. I asked where he was going and he said "my
               house". I asked where that was and he said SAE meaning the
               Sigma Alpha Epsilon. I asked how old he was and he said 19. He
               provided me with his name and date of birth, which I confirmed
               through Dispatch. As I spoke with Haub-Mcelreath I could smell
               the odor of intoxicants on his breath. I asked if I could check
               his eyes and he agreed. I administered a horizontal gaze
               nystagmus test on him and observed he had bloodshot and watery
               eyes, a lack of smooth pursuit, and a distinct and sustained
               nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes. As I was waiting
               for a return for the information provided by Haub-Mcelreath I
               asked where he was drinking at and he said he was drinking at
               the SAE house. Haub-Mcelreath refused to provide a breath
               sample. After having Dispatch check Haub-Mcelreath's III I
               advised him I would be sending the incident to student conduct.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 27 day of August, 2015, in

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Boyd/335 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3741 SYNOPSIS: Pullman PD received a
               report of a vehicle prowl at Cougar Ridge. The suspects were
               located in the parking lot at Chief Joseph Village and observed
               by officers getting into a vehicle. Pullman PD handled the case
               and I assisted in locating owners of vehicles. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 08/27/15 at about 0210
               hrs I heard Pullman PD dispatched to a reported vehicle prowl
               in progress at Cougar Ridge. A short time later I heard PPD
               Officer McNannay say he could see the subjects entering the
               Chief Joseph Village parking lot. He observed one of the
               subjects enter an unlocked vehicle. They contacted and detained
               the subjects at Chief Joseph Village. I responded and was
               informed Pullman PD located three vehicles they believed may
               have been entered by the subjects in the Chief Joseph Village
               parking lot. I assisted in locating the owners for the
               vehicles. We were able to contact two of the owners, Teneah K.
               McDaniel and Miranda D. Edmonds. Edmonds and McDaniel each
               checked their vehicle's and found nothing to be missing. I
               attempted to contact the owner of a third vehicle, Neidi
               Carrillo, by phone but was unable to do so. There was an
               address listed for Carrillo of 1545 NE Merman Dr. #20B in the
               WSU computer system, which I provided to Officer McNanny so
               they could try to contact them at another time. Officer McNanny
               handled the case since he observed the offense occur. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 27 day of August, 2015, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer
