               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 08/20/15 at about 2119
               hours dispatch advised that a male was stuck in the Heald Hall
               elevator. I responded and found Hanjo A. Hellmann(011267),
               stuck on the fourth floor. Dispatch advised they had contacted
               Fac Ops and they called an elevator technician who gave a one
               hour estimated time to respond. I attempted to open the door,
               but was unable to open it. I told Hellmann it was going to be
               an hour. He called his family to let them know. I asked
               Hellmann if he was all right waiting or if he wanted me to call
               out the Pullman Fire Department to get him out. Hellmann
               sounded concerned about the long wait and asked me to contact
               Pullman Fire. I asked dispatch to call out Pullman Fire
               Department. Pullman Fire responded and arrived just as the
               elevator technician arrived. The technician was able to open
               the door. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 21st day of August,
               2015, in Pullman, Washington.
