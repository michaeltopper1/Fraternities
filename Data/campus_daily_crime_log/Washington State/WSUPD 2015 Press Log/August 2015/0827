               CASE #: 15-W3743 SYNOPSIS: On 08-27-15 at about 0918 I
               witnessed a two vehicle non-injury collision in the Yakama
               Village parking lot. It was a non-reportable collision and the
               driver of the victim vehicle he would buff out the scuff and
               did not want information from the other driver. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 08-27-15 at about 0918
               I was driving through the Yakama Village parking lot when I saw
               a grey compact car (Wa. ARZ9055) attempting to back out of a
               parking stall. There was a safelite van (Wa. B17308P) that was
               parked perpendicular to the parked vehicles working on a
               vehicles windshield that was making it difficult for the
               compact to maneuver. The compact vehicle pulled forward in an
               attempt to make the turn, but decided to back up to make it
               easier. When the vehicle back up this time the driver side rear
               bumper bumped into the drivers side of the van causing the van
               to rock side to side. I activated my emergency lights and
               advised whitcom I was out with a 2 vehicle non-injury accident.
               I contacted the driver of the van who wasn't identified because
               he wasn't driving, he looked at the van and said he could buff
               out the scrub mark on the van. I looked at the compact car and
               saw a white rub mark on the rear bumper. Neither damage reached
               the threshold to make this a reportable collision. I contacted
               the driver of the compact, Yazdaninasab, Leila who said she was
               in a hurry. I confirmed with the driver of the van that he did
               not want the insurance and driver information and I cleared.
               nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this _27th___ day of

               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 082715 at
               approximately 1028 hours, I was dispatched to the area of
               Wegner Hall regarding a trespassing complaint. While enroute,
               dispatch advised that Thomas D. Jacroux was the suspect and
               provided a physical description of Thomas. Upon arrival, I
               located Thomas on the first floor of Wegner Hall. I asked
               Thomas if he was trespassed from Wegner Hall and he told me
               that he was trespassed from the library in Wegner and all of
               the WSU Vet School buildings, but it didn't include Wegner
               Hall. He explained that he works in Wegner Hall room 119 and
               that he will be working there for another month or so. I asked
               dispatch to check the trespass order for Thomas and they
               advised the same provisions of the order. He was trespassed
               from all WSU Vet School buildings and the Wegner Hall Library.
               I advised Thomas that I had a duty to investigate the
               situation, and explained that I didn't have any further
               questions for him. I contacted the RP, Katherine D. Reardon and
               she told me that she saw Thomas on the sidewalk in front of
               Wegner Hall and that he wasn't supposed to be there. I
               explained the provisions of the trespass order didn't include
               all of Wegner Hall and that he legally had the right to be
               where he was. Reardon told me she would be in contact with the
               judge to get the orders changed and ended the call. I cleared
               shortly after. Case unfounded. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 27th day of

               on scene. The elevator technician was working on the elevator.
               A female in a nearby office said she was the one who had been
               stuck. She was later identified as Erica J. Crespi (DOB 10-04-
               70). Crespi told me she took the elevator down from the fifth
               floor to the third and once it got to the third it jerked to a
               halt and the doors did not open. She told me she was stuck for
               about 25 minutes. Crespi said another coworker called Dispatch
               from outside of the elevator. I asked her if she was injured at
               all when the elevator came to a jerky stop, and she said no. I

               newer Camaro parked on the second level. The complainant also
               said people have started to vandalize the vehicle. I arrived on
               scene. I saw a grey, 2014 Chevy Camaro (WA Lic. APY4470) parked
               on the second level of the CUE parking garage. There was a
               female standing near the vehicle who told me she works at the
               front gate of the garage, but said she was not the complainant.
               She identified herself as Kelly K. Bates (DOB 04-13-60). Bates
               said she thinks the vehicle has been left in the same spot
               during the last summer session, but she does not know for sure.
               She recalls seeing the vehicle in the same spot a couple weeks
               ago. The vehicle had collected a good amount of dust and dirt
               on the back that people decided to start writing with and
               drawing pictures. There were a couple phallic's drawn on the
               back of the vehicle. A few things were written as well: "I miss
               my owner, really bad" "I was here :)" "I wish my wife was this
               dirty" "I'm too rich to wash this" "I'ma steal this" "I'd adopt
               you" I took photographs of the vehicle, and they were later
               uploaded into Spillman. Bates said this vehicle does not have
               the proper parking pass for this garage. They were doing
               construction in the other garage and they were allowed to park
               their temporarily, but the time is up for that. The vehicle has
               yet to be ticketed. I cleared the scene. I called the owner of
               the Camaro, Anqi Tian (DOB 09-13-94), on the phone. I told Tian
               people were drawing/writing on his vehicle in the dust that had
               collected on it. I told him his vehicle also did not have the
               current parking pass for that garage and needed to be moved or
               he would get tickets from parking. He told me he was coming
               from China, but could have the vehicle moved by the morning. I
               called parking and told them I spoke with the owner and he
               would have his vehicle moved by the morning. Parking said they
               would give him until Saturday before they begin writing him
               parking tickets. No further action at this time. I certify and

               Banyan's employee, Megan Sanchagrin outside of the restaurant.
               She described the disorderly patron as being a white male,
               medium build, bald, 6 foot 3 inches tall, wearing a gray suit,
               and he spoke with an accent, perhaps French. The male was upset
               about how his steak was cooked or not cooked. He cursed at the
               staff and told them he refused to pay for the meal. After
               yelling at the server he demanded to speak to the manager. When
               he was told she is the manager he continued his tirade
               demanding that he speak with the owner who was not at the
               restaurant. The male also confronted the chef yelling and
               cursing at him. Banyan's staff told the man to leave the
               restaurant and they were calling the police. The male did leave
               the restaurant at this point. I was told by Banyan's staff that
               this person is no longer welcome in their business and they
               would like him trespassed. Sanchagrin told me the disorderly
               male was part of a group from WSU. The entire episode happened
               after the rest of his party left the area. I was shown WSU
               purchase order #K751657 signed by Sandy Watson. Watson is the
               Assistant to the Vice President for Research. Sanchagrin also
               told me that the male was served a drink at the bar before
               dinner and had a drink with dinner. She said he didn't appear
               to be drunk, just angry. I will follow up with Watson about the
               identity of the disorderly subject. It is unknown if he is a
               WSU employee. The investigation continues. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               28th day of August, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Sydney T.Q. Pham 06/14/97 Warned Poss.
               of Marijuana 2. NARRATIVE: On 08/27/15 at approximately 2302
               hours I was dispatched to a drugs call at Honors Hall room
               230D. Upon arrival I contacted the RED on duty who stated she
               was contacted by a student who lives in the 230 pod and was
               concerned about a roommate who had marijuana. We walked to the
               230 pod and I met with 5 of the 8 roommates. One of the
               roommates, not identified, stated that the person she shares a
               room with had marijuana in the room. The female who lives in
               room 230D took me to her room and showed me a shoe box that
               contained marijuana and smoking devices. The roommate stated it
               belonged to Sydney Thu-Quyen Pham 06/14/97. I was provided with
               Pham's phone number and I called her. Pham answered the phone
               and I asked if she could return to her room and Pham said she
               would be right back. While waiting for Pham I spoke with the
               roommates present about how to have a conversation about what
               was acceptable for their living arrangement. Once Pham arrived
               we walked to her room and I asked her if she had a medical
               marijuana card and she said no. I asked Pham why she had
               marijuana in her room. Pham said she doesn't smoke but she
               "accidentally" brought the marijuana just in case she decided
               to smoke sometime. I asked Pham to show me what she had and she
               opened the shoebox. Inside was a metal grinder, marijuana
               cookies, rolling papers, and approximately 30 grams of fresh
               marijuana. I told Pham that as long as she was willing to
               destroy her illegal items I would only be sending this case to
               Student Conduct. Pham agreed. Pham and I walked outside to the
               dumpster where she destroyed all of her illegal items. I
               explained the Student Conduct side of things and Pham stated
               she understood. At this point I cleared. END OF REPORT I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 28th day of August, 2015, in Pullman,

               approximately 2340 hours I was dispatched to a drugs call at
               Streit Hall. The reporting party stated there were three males
               sitting on a small wall outside of Streit Hall facing Cougar
               Way. Upon arrival Ofc. Jones and I located three males as
               described. As I walked up to the three I did not see anybody
               actively smoking. I contacted the three and told them what had
               been reported to me and asked if anybody had a medical
               marijuana card. None said they did.All three were later
               identified as Casey Coyle Harrington 12/06/96, Calvin John
               Saribay 12/22/96, and Jacob Henry Drayer 12/03/96. I asked what
               they had been smoking and Saribay said cigarettes. I asked how
               many cigarettes they had smoked and Saribay said two. I told
               Saribay that I found it odd that they all would share only two
               cigarettes as that is very uncommon. I asked several questions
               about the cigarettes and it seemed as if Saribay was making the
               answers up on the spot. When asked how much he paid for the
               pack of cigarettes Saribay said $14 dollars. A pack of
               cigarettes is much cheaper than $14 dollars. I asked if I could
               search each person and they all said I could. I found no
               marijuana or smoking devices on their persons. While searching
               each person I could smell the odor of burnt marijuana on their
               clothing. I also found it odd there was no cigarette pack on
               them. I told the three that I did not believe their story and
               explained that I would be referring them to Student Conduct. It
               is my believe that the three had completed smoking just prior
               to my arrival. I told the three they were free to go. I met
               with Anna A. Prykhodko 11/21/91 who is an RA for Streit Hall.
               Anna stated that her dorm room is just above where the males
               were smoking. Anna said he window was open and could smell the
               odor of burnt marijuana coming into her room so she looked
               outside and saw the three with nobody else around. Anna said
               she did not see smoke coming directly from the three but there
               was nobody else in the area. Anna then notified the RA's who
               were on duty at the time. I provided the RA's with the case
               number and cleared. END OF REPORT I certify and declare under

               Kane J. Dove 05/31/96 Warned Theft NARRATIVE: On 08/28/15 at
               approximately 0102 hours I was driving eastbound on Cougar Way
               when I noticed a group of four subjects walking eastbound next
               to Northside Hall. There were two females and two males in the
               group. I noticed one female carrying an orange parking folding
               sign and a male carrying a reflective road cone. Believing that
               the sign and road cone did not belong to them I contacted the
               group. As I pulled along side the group they quickly set the
               items down. I told the group to to stop and they did. The four
               were later identified as Aidan Moffatt Amant 11/21/96, Marlaina
               C. Hagen 09/20/96, Allison Lucille Ralston 06/11/97, and Kane
               J. Dove 05/31/96. I asked the group why they had stolen the
               road sign and cone and Dove said they were just being funny. I
               explained that it was actually theft and a crime. I told the
               group that the easiest way to get in trouble in Pullman is to
               draw attention to themselves such as walking down the street
               with a large bright orange road cone. I told the group as well
               that I would not ask them how much they had to drink but was
               pretty sure they had been drinking. The group did not say
               anything. I asked the group where they had taken the sign and
               road cone from and they said just a few feet behind them. I
               told the group to put the items back and they did. I found out
               only Amant was a WSU Student. Hagen and Ralston were visiting
               from Kent, WA and Dove was visiting from Australia. I told
               Amant that he would be referred to student conduct for the
               theft. I warned the rest and told them to make better choices.

               about 0134 hours WSU Police and Pullman Fire were dispatched to
               Perham Hall 231 for an intoxicated female. I responded to the
               room and was met by Hall Staff who told me they called because
               they thought they heard someone vomiting in the room when they
               passed by. I contacted the occupant of the room Spencer. He
               said I could come in. His girlfriend, Shayla L. Anderson
               (04/23/96) was lying in a bed on the east side of the room. She
               was awake, alert, conscious, and oriented. Anderson and Spencer
               both told me they were drinking at his fraternity. She consumed
               about five (5) shots in 30 minutes or so. Anderson vomited at
               the fraternity several times. Anderson is not a WSU student,
               she is just visiting. Pullman Fire personnel evaluated
               Anderson. She did not want further medical attention. No
               further investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3769 SYNOPSIS: Report of loud music
               coming from apartment E11 at Chief Joesph Village. Resident was

               Jones/010994 Warned Noise 2. NARRATIVE: On 08/28/15 at about
               0327 hrs Dispatch advised of a noise complaint at Chief Joseph
               Village. The complaint was regarding loud noise coming from the
               apartment below E13. Officer Westerman and I responded.
               Apartment E11 is directly below apartment E13. I could not hear
               any music upon our arrival but I could hear there were people
               awake inside the apartment. I knocked on the door to contact
               one of the residents. A female, later identified as Jamie T.
               Jones (010994), answered the door. As soon as the door opened
               there was a very strong odor of burnt marijuana coming from
               inside the apartment. I told Jones we were there because of a
               noise complaint. I explained the city noise ordnance to her and
               asked for her ID. Jones retrieved her Washington Driver's
               License, which indicated she was 21. I warned Jones about
               smoking marijuana in a university owned apartment and violating
               her lease agreement. Jones said they would not smoke in the
               apartment again. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 28 day of
               August, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.
