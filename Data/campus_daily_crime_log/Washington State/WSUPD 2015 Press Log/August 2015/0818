               several times for their assistance, but no one answered his
               calls. I responded to the Stephenson Complex and asked Whitcom
               to see if the City of Pullman's Animal Control Officer (409)
               could respond as well. Upon my arrival, I learned the bat was
               caught and was under a waste basket which was turned upside
               down on top of the bat. 409 arrived on scene and took
               possession of the bat. I cleared. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 18th day of

               Pullman PD requested an AOA for a two vehicle non-injury

               drivers side front WITNESS(ES): None NARRATIVE: On 08-18-15 I
               was dispatched to an AOA for Pullman PD. They were requesting a
               WSU Unit handle a non-injury collision in the Churchill Downs
               Parking Lot. I responded to the area and saw a light color
               Mazda and a Blue Chevy Colbalt sitting in the northeast corner
               of the parking lot. As I arrived I could see that there was
               damage to the drivers side front bumper and fender areas. I
               exited my patrol car and asked if the drivers, a Blake Jacobson
               and Nicole Clark were hurt and or needed and medical attention.
               They both said they were fine and there was no need for an
               ambulance. While I took photos of the scene the two exchanged
               information. It was obvious by the positions of the vehicles
               that Clark had cut the corner in the parking lot and struck
               Jacobson's vehicle. When I asked the two what happen Clark
               admitted to cutting the corner and striking Jacobson's vehicle.
               Since it was in a parking lot I told the two I would not be
               filling out a PTCR, but they could get a copy of the report by
               going through the university. The two had finished exchanging
               information, so I asked if there was anything else I could do
               for them. They said No so I cleared the scene. I later
               downloaded the photos into spillman. Nothing

               approaching NE Olsen Street. She was in the turn lane,
               preparing to make a left hand turn onto NE Olsen Street from
               North Grand Avenue. She said as she was approaching NE Olsen
               Street, a light blue Subaru Legacy (WA/103XUN) collided with
               her vehicle as it attempted to merge into the turn lane from
               the lane traveling straight ahead. The collision left very

               patrols of the area. I told Weddle we could, but suggested that
               I meet with Kaydee and see if there was a way to enter the
               vehicle and disconnect the battery to prevent the fob from
               working. Weddle said the car had a keypad entry and that Kaydee
               could meet me at the car. I met Kaydee and disconnected the
               negative terminal. Nothing further. I certify and declare under

               Possession of Marijuana 2. NARRATIVE: On 08/18/15 at
               approximately 2310 hours I was on foot patrol on SE Forest Way
               near the Blue Lot. I heard loud bass coming from the top tier
               of the lot. I walked to the sound and found the vehicle parked
               on the east end of the lot and saw that it was occupied by a
               male subject. I activated my VieVu camera. It appeared the male
               subject was entranced by his cell phone, as he did not see me
               walking around the vehicle. I walked up to the back passenger
               door and the subject in the driver's seat finally saw me. I
               pointed at my ear hinting to the person that the music was very
               loud. The male subject turned off the music and rolled down the
               window. As the window rolled down I could see smoke coming out
               of the car and could smell the odor of burning marijuana. I
               noticed the subject's eyes were very bloodshot. I told him that
               his music was very loud and he said he was just rocking out. I
               asked how old he was and he said he was 17. I asked if he had a
               medical marijuana card and he said no. I asked how much
               marijuana was in the car. The subject removed 2 prescription
               bottles of marijuana and a pipe from his left pocket and handed
               them out the window to me. I asked for his ID and he provided
               me with his WADL, identifying him as Devyn N. Christensen
               08/28/97. I explained to Christensen that I would be forwarding
               the case to the prosecutor's office and they would contact
               juvenile services. I told Christensen that I was not going to
               arrest him or take him to jail. I answered Christensen's
               questions. I gave Christensen his ID back and asked how much
               marijuana was in his room and he said, "A fair amount." I asked
               Christensen if we could go to his room and deal with it and he
               said yes. I asked Christensen if the marijuana was his and he
               said yes. We began to walk to his room at Olympia Hall. I told
               Christensen that I was asking for consent to search his room. I
               read Christensen his Ferrier Warnings, which he said he
               understood. Christensen then called his dad and spoke to him as
               we walked. When we got near the entrance I asked Christensen if
               he remembered the things I explained about the consent to
               search and he said he did. I asked him if having that in mind
               he was still ok if I searched his room and he said he was. We
               walked to his room, 216, and Christensen keyed in. We walked to
               his desk and Christensen brought out a safe and opened it.
               Christensen handed me two jars of marijuana. I told Christensen

               that it looked like it was close to 40 grams, which would be a
               felony. I told Christensen that did not change my plan of
               actions, but wanted him to know that it might be a higher
               charge. I thanked Christensen for his cooperation and I left. I
               returned to WSUPD with the items. I tested the marijuana with a
               NIK test kit and it showed a presumptive positive result for
               Cannabis Sativa. I logged the marijuana into custody. Charges
               forwarded. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 19th day of August, 2015, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer
