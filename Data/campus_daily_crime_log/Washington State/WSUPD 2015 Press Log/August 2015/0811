               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3398 SYNOPSIS: Report of a vehicle
               having driven over the lawn behind Streit/Perham Hall. Subject
               was contacted and warned. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR#
               1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 08-11-15 at approximately 0841 hours, I was
               advised Dennis Rovetto was requesting contact reference some
               possible property damage which occurred behind Streit/Perham. I
               contacted Dennis who stated Terry Boston had been looking at
               the lawn area behind Streit/Perham when he saw a Hummer pulling
               a trailer drive through the parking lot and then drive up and
               over the lawn to a house on Creston Lane. Dennis stated they
               didn't think there was much damage as the grass is extremely
               dry there, but he had concerns the new sprinkler line may have
               been compromised. He stated they checked the line and there
               didn't seem to be any damage, but they would keep an eye on it
               and let me know if any problems developed. Dennis requested I
               contact the renters of the house and council them about driving
               on WSU property. I cleared and went to 1000 NE Creston Lane
               which is the house described by Terry Boston. I contacted Alyyx
               Copeland and advised her why I was there. She stated her father
               had been there to help them move in and he had driven across
               the lawn. She apologized and stated she understood the concern
               and it would not happen again. I advised her I would contact
               her again if any damage was discovered. She stated she
               understood. She also stated they had noticed other tire tracks
               in the area prior and thought it would be ok. She stated she
               would make sure her roommates understand it was not allowed. I
               later called Dennis and left him a voicemail regarding what I
               had learned. I cleared. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 11th day of August,
               2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               approximately 1106 hours WSU Officers were toned out to a
               burglary alarm at Beasley Coliseum, located at 925 NE North
               Fairway Rd. Dispatch advised the alarm was coming from room
               #13, the wood shop on the lower level. Cpl. Daniels asked
               dispatch if they would call inside. Dispatch advised they spoke
               to an electrical maintenance employee who accidentally set it
               off. I arrived on scene. I contacted a male standing outside of
               the wood shop, who later identified himself as Zachary L.
               Yarbrough (DOB 01-22-80). Yarbrough told me he is an Engineer
               for Coffman Engineers, and he accidentally set off the alarm. A
               Beasley Coliseum employee was able to reset the alarm and let
               Yarbrough into the wood shop. I told Yarbrough if he happens to
               set it off in the future to notify dispatch and wait outside
               for law enforcement to arrive, he said he would. I cleared the
               scene. No further action. My Vievu camera was activated, and
               the video has been downloaded into the permanent digital
               evidence folder. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 11th day of August, 2015, in
