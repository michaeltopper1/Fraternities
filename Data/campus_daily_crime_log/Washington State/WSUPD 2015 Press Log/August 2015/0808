               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3368 SYNOPSIS: Franklin County Sheriff's
               Office wanted us to relay to Crystal M. Haigh (091195) that her
               father had been in a 1 vehicle rollover collision. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 080815 at
               approximately 1809 hours dispatch asked me to call regarding a
               Message Delivery case. I called and was informed that "Neil",
               the father of Crystal M. Haigh (091195), had been in a 1
               vehicle rollover collision in Franklin County. He had wanted
               her contacted as he was going to need a ride when he got out of
               jail. He was apparently arrested for DUI. He was being taken to
               the hospital to be cleared to be taken to jail. I was told
               there were no other cars involved and that he was presumed to
               be the only person involved. I had Ofc. Jones meet me at
               Haigh's apartment at Nez Perce Apartments. We knocked on Haig's
               door and I she answered. I asked if she was Crystal and she
               confirmed she was and then she asked if we were there because
               of her father. We confirmed we were and told her he was okay.
               We gave her what information we had. She was significantly
               upset. She said she had spoken with her father that day and
               thought he sounded intoxicated. He had recently been released
               from an in patient alcohol rehabilitation program. I provided
               Haigh with my card and the contact information for Sheriff's
               Office and Ofc. Jones provided his card with additional
               resources listed on it. We learned that her step mother was
               also unavailable as she was also in an in patient facility that
               Haigh did not know where it was. It appeared to me that Haigh
               could use some extra and immediate assistance so I offered to
               take her to the station and help her work through the problems
               presented. She took me up on the offer and we returned to the
               station. We were able to confirm that her father had gone to
               the hospital and then taken to the jail. We spoke to the tow
               company and learned that the vehicle had been burned to the
               point it was unrecognizable and that most if not all of the
               contents were destroyed. We made contact with the family
               insurance company and started the claims process. Haig was able
               to speak with both the office of the Dean of Students and the
               on-call Counseling Service. She was provided with a list of
               numbers and resources should she need them. I offered to have
               her hang out with me the rest of the evening if she wished as
               she had no one in town but she felt good enough at that point
               to just go home and sleep. I drove her back to her apartment
               and cleared. I will check in on her on my next shift. Nothing
               follows. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under

               Warned MIP NARRATIVE: On 08/09/15 at about 0007 hours I was on
               patrol and observed a vehicle westbound on Valley Rd with no
               tail lights on. I followed the vehicle and saw the brake lights
               on the vehicle working but no tail lights. I activated my
               emergency lights and the vehicle (WA/AAL9705) began to stop. As
               the vehicle was stopping I could see the occupants of the
               vehicle moving around a lot. I approached the vehicle and
               contacted the driver, Chandler S. Carlsen(031695). I informed
               Carlsen the stop was being recorded and asked for his license,
               registration and proof of insurance. I asked if he knew why I
               stopped him and he said he did not. I told him his taillights
               were not on and could see that his headlights were not on
               either, Carlsen reached down and turned the lights on. I could
               smell a strong odor of alcohol coming from the vehicle. I asked
               Carlsen how much he had to drink he said he had not been
               drinking. I asked where the odor was coming from and Carlsen
               said they had just dropped a friend at the bar who was
               drinking. I asked both passengers if they had been drinking and
               they said they had not been. I asked him if he would take an
               eye test, he said he would. I did a quick HGN and thought I saw
               a lack of smooth pursuit. I returned to my vehicle and ran
               Carlsen through dispatch. Officer Westerman arrived on scene
               and I went back and asked Carlsen to exit the vehicle. I asked
               Carlsen if he would take some voluntary field sobriety test and
               he said he would. He performed all of the test and I did not
               believe he was impaired. Carlsen also provided a breath sample
               for the PBT and the reading was .000. I asked Carlsen again
               about the odor of alcohol coming from the vehicle and Carlsen
               said he was driving for the group, implying the others had been
               drinking. I had Carlsen take a seat back in the vehicle, I
               could still smell a strong odor of alcohol coming from the
               vehicle. I asked the passengers, Brittany M. Wood (081794), who
               was in the front passenger seat and Nicole B. Pittelkau
               (091794), who was seated in the back seat behind the driver, if
               they had been drinking they said they had not. I asked them if
               they had identification I could look at. Wood handed me her
               driver's license and Pittelkau provided her name and date of

               then informed me there was box of beer covered by a sweatshirt
               behind the front passenger seat. I asked who the beer belonged
               to and they all said it belonged to their friend they had
               dropped off. I asked them if they would hand the beer out to me
               and they did. There was 5 coors light in the box. I asked if
               there was anymore alcohol in the vehicle, they said there was
               not. I went back to my vehicle and ran the two passengers and
               they were clear. I then went back to the vehicle. I explained I
               was warning all of them for minor in possession of alcohol and
               I would be forwarding my report to student conduct, as they
               were all students. I observed as they emptied the 5 beers into
               the grass on the side of the road and placed the trash in the
               trunk of their vehicle. Carlsen, Wood and Pittelkau warned for
               MIP, report forwarded to student conduct. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of

               Hawkins 06/25/90 Cited/Released DUI 5Z0872222 2. NARRATIVE: On
               August 9th, 2015 at approximately 0142 hours I was parked on
               Garden Ave monitoring traffic on Merman Drive when I noticed a
               brown Oldsmobile Cutlass heading southbound on Merman Drive.
               The vehicle appeared to be traveling faster than the posted 25
               MPH zone. I activated my handheld radar (Decatur Scout 2013)
               and obtained a reading of 32 MPH. The Cutlass came to a stop at
               the stop sign for the intersection of Merman Drive and Valley
               Road. The Cutlass turned left onto westbound Valley Road. When
               the Cutlass turned right, the driver did not use his turn
               signal. I pulled into traffic to attempt to catch up to the car
               and noticed that the Cutlass was accelerating at a high rate of
               speed on Valley Road. I sped up to 40 MPH and the Cutlass was
               still pulling away from me. I estimated the speed of the
               Cutlass to be between 40 and 50 MPH in the 25 MPH zone. While
               trying to catch up to the Cutlass I noticed the driver's
               movements were jerky however the driver never crossed the
               center line. I caught up to the Cutlass at Valley Road and
               Providence Court and initiated a traffic stop. I contacted the
               driver, James Earl Hawkins 06/25/90, identified myself,
               informed the driver I was recording, and explained the reason
               for the stop. I asked for Hawkins' driver's license, proof of
               insurance, and vehicle registration. While standing at the
               driver's side window I could smell the odor intoxicants coming
               from within the car. I asked Hawkins if he had anything to
               drink tonight and Hawkins replied, "No I probably had one or
               two beers that's it." I asked Hawkins if I could check his eyes
               and he stated yes. I preformed an HGN test on Hawkins as he sat
               in the vehicle. I told Hawkins to follow the tip of my finger
               with his eyes only and do not move his head. During the HGN
               test I observed equal pupil size, equal tracking, lack of
               smooth pursuit, and distinct and sustained nystagmus. Hawkins'
               eyes were bloodshot. I asked Hawkins to come talk to me outside
               of the car. Hawkins opened his car door and immediately dropped
               his cell phone onto the street. I asked Hawkins if he was
               willing to do some voluntary standardized field sobriety tests.
               Hawkins stated he would. The tests were conducted on a level
               and paved sidewalk on Valley Road. Hawkins was wearing a tee
               shirt, cotton shorts, and flip flops at the time of the tests.
               The sidewalk was lit by street lights, patrol car spot light,

               and personal flashlight. I explained to Hawkins that I would be
               evaluating him on how well he followed my instructions as well
               as how well he performed the tests. The first test I
               administered was the HGN test. I instructed Hawkins to stand
               with his heels and toes together and keep his arms at his
               sides. I told Hawkins to remain in that position while I
               administered the test. I told Hawkins to follow the tip of my
               pen with his eyes only and not to move his head. I held my pen
               approximately 12-15 inches away from Hawkins' head. Before I
               even started the test Hawkins lost his balance and stumbled
               backwards. Hawkins regained his balance but then a few seconds
               later again lost his balance and stumbled to his right. During
               the test I observed, equal pupil size, equal tracking, lack of
               smooth pursuit, and distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum
               deviation in both eyes. During the test Hawkins was swaying in
               all directions. As I stood before Hawkins, I could clearly
               smell the overpowering odor of intoxicants coming from his
               breath. The next test I administered was the walk and turn. I
               told Hawkins to place his left foot on an imaginary line before
               him. I then instructed Hawkins to place his right foot heel to
               toe in front of his left foot and keep his arms at his side.
               Hawkins put both feet about shoulder width apart but was
               standing at a 45 degree angle from the straight line. I told
               Hawkins to touch heel to toe but Hawkins was not understanding.
               I had to tell and show Hawkins several times how to touch heel
               to toe. Once I was able to get Hawkins into the starting
               position, Hawkins lost his balance twice and stumbled to the
               side. Hawkins also began to lean. Hawkins was leaning so much
               that his hand was almost touching the ground. It was clear that
               Hawkins was unable to balance while standing still. I told
               Hawkins to remain in the starting position as I gave further
               instructions. I told Hawkins, when I tell you to begin, don't
               begin until I tell you, you will take a series of nine heel to
               toe steps down the line, with your arms at your side, looking
               down at your feet, and counting your steps out loud. Once you
               reach your ninth step leave your lead foot planted and with
               your rear foot take a series of small steps until you are
               facing where you came from and again take nine return heel to
               toe steps. I demonstrated the test for Hawkins. I reminded
               Hawkins to keep his arms at his side, count his steps out loud,
               look down at his feet, and do not stop the test until he had
               completed it. I asked Hawkins if he understood and Hawkins said
               he did. I asked Hawkins if he would like me to demonstrate the
               test again and he said no. Instruction Phase: Hawkins started
               the test while I was still demonstrating. Hawkins could not
               keep his balance at all. First Nine Steps: Hawkins initially
               took 12 steps before coming to a stop. During those 12 steps
               Hawkins missed heel to toe on all of them. Hawkins was clearly
               unsteady on his feet and his movements were very jerky. Hawkins
               also counted his 4th step twice. When Hawkins reached his 12th
               step he stopped. After approximately 5 seconds of Hawkins
               standing still I asked Hawkins if he had completed the test.
               Hawkins said, "yeah I believe I did." Hawkins then started
               walking again and started counting from the number 4. Hawkins
               took 13 more steps and was incorrectly counting them. I told

               Hawking to go ahead and stop the test. Hawkins replied, "I'm
               going to do 15 sir." Hawkins took two more steps and said "17."
               Some of Hawkins' steps looked more like stumbles making it hard
               to accurately count his steps. Hawkins took approximately 27
               steps. I stopped the test because it was clear that Hawkins was
               not going to attempt a turn or return steps. The next test I
               administered was the One Leg Stand. I instructed Hawkins to
               stand with his heels and toes together and keep his arms at his
               side. I told Hawkins to remain in that position while I gave
               him further instructions. I told Hawkins, when I tell you to
               begin, don't begin until I tell you, you will raise either leg
               of your choice and raise it six inches off the ground. Hawkins
               interrupted me and told me that I must tell him which leg to
               raise. I told Hawkins he could choose. Hawkins again said I
               needed to tell him so I told Hawkins to raise his right leg. I
               continued the instructions by saying, you must point your toe
               so the sole of your shoe is parallel with the ground. While
               pointing your toe, keep your arms at your side, leg straight,
               look down at your foot and count out loud, one thousand one,
               one thousand two, one thousand three, and so on until I tell
               you to stop. I demonstrated the test as I explained it. I asked
               Hawkins if he understood and he stated yes. I asked Hawkins if
               he wanted me to demonstrate the test again and he said no. I
               told Hawkins to begin. Hawkins told me I did not tell him what
               leg to raise. I told him to raise his dominate leg. Hawkins
               said I needed to tell him which one. I told Hawkins to raise
               his left leg. Hawkins raised his left leg which was bent at the
               knee. Hawkins was not looking at his foot or counting out loud.
               It was clear that Hawkins did not understand the directions
               even though he told me he did. I stopped the test and re-
               demonstrated the test. I told Hawkins to begin and he raised
               his right leg. Hawkins counted to 1003 before he had to put his
               foot down. Hawkins raised his leg again and immediately put it
               down. Hawkins raised his foot and counted to 1004 before again
               putting his foot down. Hawkins raised his foot and less than a
               second had to put it down. Hawkins raised and dropped his foot
               several more times. During the test Hawkins put his foot down a
               total of 7 times. I told Hawkins that the last test I had for
               him was the PBT. I explained what the PBT was, that it was
               voluntary, and it did not replace the evidentiary breath test.
               I found my PBT (Alco-Sensor FST #16805) in working condition.
               Hawkins provided a PBT sample of .196. I told Hawkins that he
               was under arrest for DUI and handcuffed (D/L) him. I advised
               Hawkins that he was being audio and video recorded. Hawkins was
               read his Miranda Rights and Hawkins stated he understood his
               rights. Hawkins was searched incident to arrest and nothing of
               evidentiary value was found. I placed Hawkins in the back seat
               of my patrol car. I told Hawkins that his vehicle was going to
               be towed and wanted to know if there was anything in the car he
               wanted out of it. Hawkins asked for his cell phone and wallet.
               Ofc. Whitman stayed with the vehicle and I transported Hawkins
               to Pullman Police Department for BAC. At 0216 hours I checked
               Hawkins' mouth finding no foreign substances. I read Hawkins
               his Constitutional Rights at 0218 hours. Hawkins stated he
               understood his rights and signed he understood his rights and

               decided not to exercise his rights. I read Hawkins the Implied
               Consent Warning for Breath and Hawkins signed that it had been
               read to him at 0221 hours. Hawkins checked the yes box that he
               was willing to provide a breath sample. Hawkins provided a
               breath sample of .185(IR) .189(EC) at 0239 hours and another
               sample of .194(IR) .192(EC) at 0243 hours. The breath test was
               administered in accordance to the methods approved by the
               Washington State Toxicologist pursuant to the Washington
               Administrative Code. I provided Hawkins a copy of the following
               documents: Driver's Hearing Request, Notice of
               Hearing/Conditions of Release, tow and impound form, and the
               breath test document. Hawkins was issued Sector Citation
               5Z0872222 for RCW 46.61.502 DUI. I explained the citation and
               provided him with his copy. Hawkins was finger printed and
               photographed. Hawkins' vehicle was impounded by Myer's Towing
               for 12 hours. My VieVu camera footage was uploaded to the
               department's computer. END OF REPORT I certify and declare
