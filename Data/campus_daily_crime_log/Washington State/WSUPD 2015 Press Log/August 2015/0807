               & Reckless 5Z0872219 Endangerment 5Z0872220 2. NARRATIVE: On
               August 7th, 2015 at approximately 2228 hours I was driving
               northbound on Stadium Way approaching North Fairway when I
               noticed a white Chevrolet Tahoe stopped at the intersection of
               North Fairway and Stadium Way. The Tahoe was facing westbound
               on North Fairway. As I neared the intersection, the Tahoe
               accelerated quickly. The Tahoe was turning left onto southbound
               Stadium Way. As the Tahoe made its turn, the driver took a wide
               turn, skipping over the inside lane and crossed into the
               outside lane. The driver made no attempt to turn into the
               closest lane or signal the lane change. I noticed the Tahoe's
               movements appeared to be jerky. The Tahoe continued to
               accelerate quickly southbound on Stadium Way passing me. The
               Tahoe appeared to be traveling faster than the posted 20 MPH
               zone. I turned around to stop the Tahoe. Once turned around the
               Tahoe approached a radar sign on the sidewalk of Stadium Way
               near the Cougar Statue. The radar sign is designed to display
               the approaching vehicle's speed. If a vehicle is traveling 11
               MPH over the posted speed then the message, "TOO FAST" is
               displayed. As soon as the Tahoe reached the radar field, the
               message board displayed TOO FAST indicating that the Tahoe was
               exceeding the speed limit by a minimum of 11 MPH. As soon as
               the Tahoe passed the radar sign the driver quickly changed
               lanes and did not signal their turn. As I caught up to the car
               the Tahoe appeared visually to be traveling between 30 to 35
               MPH in the 20 MPH zone. I activated my emergency lights and the
               driver came to a stop at Stadium Way and Grimes Way. I
               contacted the driver, Anna Elaine Rubalcava 11/30/80,
               identified myself, informed the driver I was recording, and
               explained the reason for the stop. I asked for Rubalcava's
               driver's license, proof of insurance, and vehicle registration.
               As Rubalcava was looking for her documents I noticed two young
               boys in the third row seating. The boys were later determined
               to be 7 and 9 years old. While standing at the driver's side
               window I could smell the odor of intoxicants coming from within
               the car. I asked Rubalcava how much she had to drink and she
               said none. I asked Rubalcava if I could check her eyes and she

               stated yes. I preformed an HGN test on Rubalcava as she sat in
               the vehicle. I told Rubalcava to follow the tip of my finger
               with her eyes only and do not move her head. As soon as I moved
               my finger, Rubalcava moved her head to follow. I reminded
               Rubalcava to keep her head still. During the HGN test I
               observed equal pupil size, equal tracking, lack of smooth
               pursuit, and distinct and sustained nystagmus in both eyes.
               Rubalcava's eyes were bloodshot. I returned to my patrol car
               and ran Rubalcava through dispatch. Rubalcava's return was
               clear. About this time Ofc. Whitman arrived on scene. I asked
               Rubalcava to come speak with me on the sidewalk. Rubalcava
               exited her car and walked over to me. Rubalcava's walk was fine
               until she reached where I was standing. Rubalcava stumbled
               slightly when she stopped walking. I told Rubalcava that I did
               not believe that she had not been drinking and asked if she was
               willing to perform some voluntary field sobriety tests.
               Rubalcava said, "okay." The tests were conducted on a level and
               paved parking garage exit next to Stadium Way. Rubalcava was
               wearing a swimming suit cover up and flat slip on styled shoes
               at the time of the tests. The area was lit by street lights,
               patrol car spot lights, and personal flashlight. I explained to
               Rubalcava that I would be evaluating her on how well she
               followed my instructions as well as how well she performed the
               tests. The first test I administered was the HGN test. I
               instructed Rubalcava to stand with her heels and toes together
               and keep her arms at her sides. I told Rubalcava to remain in
               that position while I administered the test. Rubalcava stated
               she understood. I told Rubalcava to follow the tip of my pen
               with her eyes only and not to move her head. I held my pen
               approximately 12-15 inches away from Rubalcava's head. During
               the test I observed, equal pupil size, equal tracking, lack of
               smooth pursuit, and distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum
               deviation in both eyes. As the test went on Rubalcava began to
               sway forward and back. I could smell the odor of intoxicants
               coming from her breath as she stood before me. The next test I
               administered was the walk and turn. I told Rubalcava to place
               her left foot on an imaginary line before her. I then
               instructed Rubalcava to place her right foot heel to toe in
               front of her left foot and keep her arms at her side. Rubalcava
               got into the starting position as instructed. I told Rubalcava
               to remain in that position as I gave further instructions. I
               told Rubalcava, when I tell you to begin, don't begin until I
               tell you, you will take a series of nine heel to toe steps down
               the line, with your arms at your side, looking down at your
               feet, and counting your steps out loud. Once you reach your
               ninth step leave your lead foot planted and with your rear foot
               take a series of small steps until you are facing where you
               came from and again take nine return heel to toe steps. I
               demonstrated the test for Rubalcava. I reminded Rubalcava to
               keep her arms at her side, count her steps out loud, look down
               at her feet, and do not stop the test until she had completed
               it. I asked Rubalcava if she understood and Rubalcava said she
               did. I asked Rubalcava if she would like me to demonstrate the
               test again and she said no. Instruction Phase: It took several
               attempts to get Rubalcava into the starting position because

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
               she kept losing her balance. I had to tell Rubalcava several
               times how to position her feet heel to toe. While demonstrating
               the test, Rubalcava lost her balance and stepped out of the
               starting position. First Nine Steps: Rubalcava counted standing
               in the starting position as step one. Therefore the first step
               Rubalcava counted, "Two." On steps 3 through 9, Rubalcava did
               not touch heel to toe. It was as if Rubalcava was not even
               attempting to touch heel to toe. Rubalcava took a total of 9
               steps which would have been 10 steps Rubalcava counted out loud
               but Rubalcava did not count her last step out loud. Rubelcava's
               last step she stopped and stood there. After 10 seconds of
               waiting for Rubelcava to continue the test I asked Rubalcava if
               she was done. Rubelcava said she was. Rubelcava did not attempt
               her turn or return 9 steps. The next test I administered was
               the One Leg Stand. I instructed Rubalcava to stand with her
               heels and toes together and keep her arms at her side. I told
               Rubalcava to remain in that position while I gave her further
               instructions. I told Rubalcava, when I tell you to begin, don't
               begin until I tell you, you will raise either leg of your
               choice and raise it six inches off the ground. You must point
               your toe so the sole of your shoe is parallel with the ground.
               While pointing your toe, keep your arms at your side, leg
               straight, look down at your foot and count out loud, one
               thousand one, one thousand two, one thousand three, and so on
               until I tell you to stop. I demonstrated the test as I
               explained it. I asked Rubalcava if she understood and she
               stated yes. I asked Rubalcava if she would like me to
               demonstrate the test again and she said no. I told Rubelcava to
               begin and she raised her right leg and began counting.
               Rubelcava only reached 1002 before she lost her balance and had
               to put her foot down. Rubelcava raised her leg again and only
               made it about one second before she had to put her foot down
               again. Rubelcava raised her leg for a third time and was able
               to keep it up for approximately four seconds before putting it
               down again. While Rubelcava had her leg raised, her leg was
               bent at the knee. Rubelcava also used her arms for balance.
               When Rubelcava put her foot down she looked at me for
               approximately five seconds before I asked her if she was done.
               Rubelcava said, "yeah did you want me to do more." I told
               Rubelcava that I had told her to continue until I told her to
               stop. Rubelcava raised her leg in a bent fashion and continued
               the test. Rubelcava was no longer counting out loud. I told
               Rubalcava that the last test I had for her was the PBT. I
               explained what the PBT was, that it was voluntary, and it did
               not replace the evidentiary breath test. I found my PBT (Alco-
               Sensor FST #16805) in working condition. Rubalcava provided a
               PBT sample of .213. I told Rubalcava that she was under arrest
               for DUI and handcuffed (D/L) her. I advised that she was being
               audio and video recorded. Rubalcava was read her Miranda Rights
               and Rubalcava stated she understood her rights. I asked who
               could come pick up her kids. Rubalcava said her husband,
               Enrique Rubalcava 11/28/72 could. I placed Rubalcava in the
               backseat of my patrol car and retrieved Rubalcava's purse and
               cell phone for her. Rubalcava showed me Enrique's contact info
               in her phone and I called him. There was no answer. I called

               Enrique again and he answered the phone. I explained the
               situation to Enrique and he said he had been drinking so he
               could not drive. Enrique said he would call his mother and then
               call me back. I had Cpl. Edwards respond to the scene to assist
               with the children. Once on scene I explained the situation to
               Cpl. Edwards and provided her with Enrique's information. Ofc.
               Whitman and Cpl. Edwards stayed with the two boys while I
               transported Rubalcava to the Pullman Holding Facility for BAC.
               The two boys were later identified as Connor D. Higgins
               01/27/08 (7 years old) and Liam J. Higgins 08/02/06 (9 years
               old). Once at the holding faclility I checked Rubalcava's mouth
               finding no foreign substances at 2306 hours. I read Rubalcava
               her Constitutional Rights at 2308 hours. Rubalcava stated she
               understood her rights and signed she understood her rights and
               decided not to exercise her rights. I read Rubalcava the
               Implied Consent Warning for Breath and Rubalcava signed that it
               had been read to her at 2310 hours. Rubalcava checked the yes
               box that she was willing to provide a breath sample. Rubalcava
               provided a breath sample of .231(IR) .231(EC) at 2326 hours and
               another sample of .224(IR) .220(EC) at 2330 hours. The breath
               test was administered in accordance to the methods approved by
               the Washington State Toxicologist pursuant to the Washington
               Administrative Code. I provided Rubalcava a copy of the
               following documents: Driver's Hearing Request, Notice of
               Hearing/Conditions of Release, tow and impound form, and the
               breath test document. Rubalcava was issued Sector Citation
               5Z0872219 for RCW 46.61.502 DUI and Sector Citation 5Z0872220
               for two counts of Reckless Endangerment. I explained the
               citations and provided her with her copy. Rubalcava's driving
               abstract showed that she had been arrested in Adams County, WA
               on 04/08/13. Rubalcava refused to provide a breath sample and a
               blood warrant was obtained. The analysis of the blood indicated
               her BAC was .190. I asked Rubalcava if her two children were in
               her car when she was arrested for her first DUI. Rubalcava said
               yes. I asked if the reckless endangerment charge had stemmed
               from that DUI and she again said yes. Due to this being
               Rubalcava's second DUI within a 10 year span she was booked
               into the Whitman County Jail under the mandatory booking
               statute. Prior to transporting Rubalcava to the Whitman County
               Jail, I spoke with Enrique and explained the situation to him.
               I provided Enrique with the Tow Impound Form so he could get
               the Tahoe out of impound quicker if he so decided. Rubalcava's
               vehicle was impounded by Auto Body Super Center. My VieVu
               camera footage was uploaded to the department's computer. END
