    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: DBT/321 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3599 SYNOPSIS: I was responding to an
               elevator alarm at Fulmer Hall, when I was flagged down by a
               nearby vehicle. Subject was having a medical emergency so I
               transported her to the Pullman Regional Hospital emergency
               room. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               08-21-15 I was dispatched to an elevator alarm at Fulmer Hall,
               located at 1320 East College Ave. As soon as I arrived on scene
               a male exited the vehicle on the side of the road in front of
               me. He told me his back passenger was having a medical
               emergency and asked if I could take her to the emergency room.
               The female was in the back seat and appeared to be having
               breathing difficulty. The female was later identified as Joelle
               T. Reiser (DOB 08-17-90). I asked them if I could have medical
               respond to the area, but she appeared like she needed immediate
               medical attention. Reiser told me she thinks it may be a cyst
               in her neck, but she was unsure. I asked if she would be fine
               riding in my patrol vehicle, and she said yes. I transported
               her to the Pullman Regional Hospital emergency. When she exited
               the vehicle she appeared weak and used the nearby pillar to
               help support her weight. I offered her my arm and helped escort
               inside the emergency room where she was turned over to the
               medical staff. I cleared the scene. No further action. My Vievu
               camera was activated, and the video has been downloaded into
               the permanent digital evidence folder. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               Brendan E. Porter drove his Coca Cola work truck into a light
               pole in front of the CUB. Computer Report NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 082115 at
               approximately 1412 hours, I was dispatched to a report of a
               traffic collision on Wilson Road near the CUB. Upon arrival, I
               contacted Brendan E. Porter who told me the following. At
               approximately 1400 hours, he was attempting to back his red
               2011 Chevrolet Silverado (Coca Cola work truck) between the CUB
               and a light pole. Porter told me that he thought he had cleared
               the light pole and backed far enough. He stated that he was
               attempting to pull forward and the light pole was in the "A"
               post between the windshield and door. He stated he never saw
               the light post and hit it causing it to fall over and break.
               Porter provided the insurance information for the vehicle which
               I documented as Discover Property and Casualty Insurance
               Company Policy #HC2E-CAP-9C589835-TCT-15 which expired 03/2016.
               The light post was laying on the ground and shattered and the
               base had exposed wires. I called WSU Facilities to clean up the
               light pole mess. I took photographs of the damage to the light
               pole and the dent to the front bumper of the Coca Cola truck. I
               estimated the damage to the light pole at approximately
               $1500.00 and $1000 to the truck. Forward to WSU Risk Management
               for insurance billing. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 22nd day of August,

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3606 SYNOPSIS: Subject voluntarily went
               to PRH for a mental health evaluation. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 08-21-15 at about 1635 hours
               WSU units were emergency dispatched to the Washington Building,
               room 146, for the report of a disorderly subject in that room.
               While en route, Whitcom advised that the patient was manic and
               not taking their medication. Officer Petlovany and I arrived on
               scene and contacted the psychologist, Bill Gibson. Petlovany
               spoke with Gibson who told us that the patient was "gravely
               disabled". I went into room 146 and spoke with the patient,
               Jordan Hutchens. I asked Hutchens what was going on today and
               she started to become upset and cry. She said that the doctor
               was telling her she was crazy and needed to take her
               medication. She told me she is not crazy and that she is just
               very happy. I let Hutchens speak for several minutes about what
               was going on today. While she spoke she bounced from topic to
               topic, and did not make much sense. She explained she is very
               spiritual, then mentioned that the government is watching us
               through objects (and pointed to a chair) and that she sees good
               in everybody. Hutchens explained that she almost died from a
               Staph infection in April and was very upset about that. I asked
               Hutchens how to came to be at the doctor today, if she had an
               appointment or walked in. She said her sorority sisters called
               and made the appointment for her. She was upset with this too,
               and said they are not her real friends and does not know why
               they would do this to her. She said they also called her
               mother, which upset her. I asked Hutchens if she was supposed
               to take medications and she said no. I asked her if she's been
               depressed and she said 5 months ago, but not recently. I asked
               her if she had taken any illegal drugs and she said no. I asked
               Hutchens if she has ever seen a psycologist before and she said
               no. Although when speaking to Hutchens she did not seem capable
               of completing a thought, I did not feel like she was a threat
               to herself or others. Officer Petlovany joined me in room 146
               and asked if she would voluntarily go to PRH to speak with a
               mental health professional. She agreed and said she would "do
               anything to prove she isn't crazy". I transported Hutchens to
               PRH and briefed the ER staff on what I had learned. They were
               informed that she was there voluntarily and not in protective
               custody. Send information to WSU Counseling Services. I certify

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3607 SYNOPSIS: RED reported possible
               Hate/Bias activity. Possible victim did not want to speak with
               me and did not want me to speak to suspect. Refer to OEO.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 082115
               at approximately 1652 we were dispatched to a Harassment call.
               Once we cleared the call we were on, I contacted the rp, RED
               McClure, via phone as requested. He informed me that he had a
               resident (Krubale Mulugeta) who had been moved by request due
               to comments made by his former roommate, Cristian Valencia.
               McClure said he had spoken with Mulugeta but not Valencia and
               that he was waiting on direction from his chain of command. I
               responded to Rogers Hall and met with McClure who told me that
               Valencia had been putting Mulugeta down for his ethnicity and
               race. The CAD comments had stated "Roommate putting him down
               for his ethnicity and culture. Student has contacted the school
               and told them that he wants to move to a different room or he
               is going to drop out. Vic student said that he felt harassed
               and didn't feel safe. Harassment occurred in the last week.
               Student was moved a few days ago to a new room." McClure felt
               it would be okay to go talk to Mulugeta. We went to his room
               and Mulugeta answered the door. He told me he was not
               interested in speaking about the incident or having me speak
               with Valencia. He did not want me to speak with Valencia. I
               told him that was his right, but informed him that OEO or
               Student Conduct may want to follow up with him, as I would be
               sending them the information I had. He was polite and cordial.
               I thanked him for his time and left. I then clarified with
               McClure that he did not think any threats or other crimes had
               been committed. He believed non-threatening words had been
               used. I cleared. Nothing follows. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 23rd day of

               hours I was notified by WSUPD Intern York that there was an
               intern that was injured today during their OC spray
               certification. She advised that she was on her way to the ER
               with Intern Samantha Hammer. I went to PRH to meet with York
               and Hammer. When I arrived I found out that another intern was
               just checking in, Intern Block. I asked Hammer what was going
               on. She said that since she was sprayed this afternoon she has
               not been able to open her eyes. Intern Block stated that he
               thought he was ok after being sprayed, but as the evening went
               on his eyes starting buring more and more to the point that he
               could not open them now. I advised that hospital staff that
               both patients would be L&I claims. Hammer and Block had people
               with them, so I left. I returned to the station and completed

               and I were on a foot patrol in the area of Streit Perham when I
               noticed five males huddled in a circle near some juniper
               bushes. I walked over to the group and turned on my flashlight.
               With my flashlight on I could see a glass bong on the ground in
               the middle of the group. I also noticed one of the males, later
               identified as Bradley D. Blayden 10/22/96, was holding a small
               jar that contained approximately 3 grams of fresh marijuana. It
               was clear that the five had intended on smoking the marijuana.
               I asked for everybody's IDs and they all provided their WADLs.
               The five were identified as Nathanial Hunter Johnson 01/22/97,
               Brent Benjamin Donlan 01/03/97, Kyle J. Naranjo 11/15/96,
               Bradley Dean Blayden 10/22/96, and Matthew Steven Ellegson
               09/14/97. All were identified as under the age of 21 years old.
               Each person was asked if they had a medical marijuana card and
               all stated they did not. I asked the group why they were out
               smoking marijuana and Blayden said, "because its fun." I
               thanked Blayden for his honesty but told him that it was
               probably not the best idea. I told the group that it was clear
               that they had intended to smoke but I had interrupted them
               before they could. Due to their cooperation and honesty I told
               the group that I would only be sending this case to Student
               Conduct and not arresting them. We all walked to a dumpster
               where they destroyed their marijuana and bong. I explained the
               Student Conduct process to everybody and told them they were
               free to go. END OF REPORT I certify and declare under penalty

               beers. I asked how old he was and he said 18. As I spoke to
               Henderson I could smell the odor of intoxicants on his breath.
               I asked if he had his ID with him and he provided his WSU
               student ID and his date of birth. I asked if I could check his
               eyes and he agreed. I attempted to administer a horizontal gaze
               nystagmus test on him but he could not follow my pen with his
               eyes for the test. Henderson was able to answer all my
               questions and appeared able to care for himself. I asked if he
               would provide a breath sample and he agreed. He provided a
               sample of .246 on alco sensor FST #5493. Henderson said he had
               been arrested for DUI a couple months prior. I advised
               Henderson he was under arrest for MIP exhibiting and placed him
               in handcuffs (double locked). I advised him of his right to
               remain silent, his right to an attorney, and that he was being
               recorded. I had him sit on the curb near Corporal Edwards'
               patrol vehicle while I completed a citation. I issued Henderson
               sector citation #5Z0347689 for MIP exhibiting. I explained the
               citation to him. he received his copy, and was released.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 22 day of August, 2015, in

               about 0035 hrs I was driving westbound on Washington St. from
               Nevada St. when I noticed two males who were walking along
               Washington St. They caught my attention because they both
               appeared to be under 21 and one of them, later identified as
               Gabriel J. Berbig, was holding what appeared to be a beer can.
               When Berbig saw my vehicle approaching he straightened his back
               and began walking somewhat stiffly, in an apparent attempt to
               make sure he was walking straight. He also cupped the can in
               his hand and tried to hid it behind his arm/body. I turned
               around and stopped to contact Berbig and Anhold. As I
               approached Berbig put the can in his pocket. I asked what he
               was hiding and he said " a can of Busch". I had him remove the
               can and place it on the ground. I noticed the can was almost
               full but open. I asked if they had ID and they both provided
               their driver's license's, which confirmed they were both under
               21. They both admitted to having consumed about 4 beers. I
               asked if I could check their eyes. They both agreed. I
               administered a horizontal gaze nystagmus on each one. I
               observed they both had a lack of smooth pursuit and a distinct
               and sustained nystagmus in both eyes. I could smell the odor of
               alcohol on their breath as I administered the test. Their ID's
               were checked through Dispatch. They both said they had never
               been contacted for drugs/alcohol before. I advised them the
               incident would be sent to student conduct only and had Berbig
               pour out his beer. Nothing further. I certify and declare under

               Exhibiting 2. NARRATIVE: On 08/22/15 at about 0113 hrs I was
               turning on to Spokane St. from Stadium Way when I noticed a
               male, later identified as Brenden C. Cox, who was walking
               southbound on Spokane St. He caught my attention because he was
               walking on the west side of Spokane St. next to a construction
               zone. Due to the construction zone he was walking in the
               parking stalls along the roadway. He appeared to be under 21
               and was stumbling side to side as he walked. I contacted Cox as
               he rounded the corner on to Stadium Way, walking toward East
               Main St. I asked where he was going and he said he was headed
               home, to Forest Way. I asked how much he had to drink and he
               said "not a lot". He said he did not have any ID with him but
               admitted to being 20 years old. He provided me with his name
               and date of birth, which I later confirmed through Dispatch. I
               could smell the odor of intoxicants on Cox's breath as I spoke
               to him. I asked if I could check his eyes and he agreed. I
               administered a horizontal gaze nystagmus test on him and
               observed he had bloodshot watery eyes, a lack of smooth
               pursuit, and a distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum
               deviation in both eyes. Cox swayed side to side as I
               administered the test and I had to remind him once not to move
               his head. I told Cox I would be sending the incident to student
               conduct only, because he said he had never been arrested or
               warned for drugs/alcohol before. I asked Cox how much alcohol
               was in his backpack and he said he had a few beers. I had him
               remove the 4 beers that were in the backpack and pour them out.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury

               2. Lilly F. Ross/07-26-97 Warned MIP Exhibiting (Not a student)
               NARRATIVE: On 08-22-15 at about 0116 hours I was on patrol on
               Thatuna Dr when I observed two females inside the constuction
               fence of the old K House. The area is obviously a construction
               zone, with fence, cones and red tape surrounding the perimeter.
               As I pulled into the parking lot to contact them they lifted
               the red tape and walked towards me. I asked to talk with them
               and they both stopped. I asked what they were doing inside the
               construction zone and they told me they were just walking home
               and did not know it was an area they could not be. As I spoke
               with the females I could smell a strong odor of alcohol on
               their breath and both appeared to be under the age of 21. They
               were identified as Brianna M. Pluff and Lilly F. Ross. Pluff
               said she is a new student and was not familiar with the area
               and apologized for being in an area she was not supposed to be.
               Ross said she was just visiting. I asked Pluff and Ross how
               much they have had to drink tonight and they both stated "just
               a little bit". Ross's eyes were bloodshot and watery. I asked
               them where they were going and Pluff said back to her dorm at
               Stephenson East. I warned Pluff and Ross for MIP Exhibiting and
               told Pluff that the information would be sent to student
               conduct. Pluff and Ross were polite and cooperative during my
               contact with them. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the

               who appeared to be passed out. Subject was reunited with his
               friend to continue their journey home. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Keith R. Rosenbaum 11/04/93 2. NARRATIVE: On
               08/22/15 at approximately 0243 hours I was driving southbound
               on B Street near Alpha Street when I noticed a person who
               appeared to be laying on the westside sidewalk. The sidewalk is
               elevated from the roadway making it difficult to tell if the
               person was injured or needing assistance. I parked at B St and
               California and walked down to the person. I found Keith Rayn
               Rosenbaum 11/04/93 sitting on the sidewalk with his back
               resting up against a railing that prevented pedestrians from
               falling down the steep hill and into the roadway below. I asked
               Rosenbaum if he was ok and Rosenbaum said he was waiting for
               his friend. Rosenbaum's words were heavily slurred. Believing
               that Rosenbaum may be intoxicated to the level that he was
               having a medical issue, I asked him a series of questions.
               Rosenbaum incorrectly said the current month was July and the
               president of the United States was George Bush. About this time
               Ofc. Boyd arrived on scene and notified Pullman PD what we were
               out with. I asked Rosenbaum where he was living and he stated
               Okanogan County. Rosenbaum said he was just in town visiting a
               friend. Rosenbaum said his friend lives in the Cougar Crest
               Apartments. I asked Rosenbaum to point in the direction of the
               apartments and Rosenbaum pointed in the opposite direction. I
               asked Rosenbaum if he could call his friend and see if they
               could pick him up. Rosenbaum called his friend and eventually
               handed me the cell phone. I spoke to an unidentified male who
               said he had been walking with Rosenbaum but Rosenbaum
               disappeared. I told the friend where we were and he said he
               would walk to our location. I again asked Rosenbaum my series
               of questions and this time he answered all of the correctly.
               About this time Sgt. Dornes arrived on scene and took over the
               call. END OF REPORT I certify and declare under penalty of

               and contacted Benjamin D. Phaneuf (DOB 12-22-1989) at the main
               entrance. I confirmed that Phaneuf was authorized to be in the
               building. Phaneuf said he had just entered the building and
               thought he had turned off the alarm properly. After speaking
               with Phaneuf, it was determined that the alarm was caused by
               employee error. Officer Whitman and I cleared the scene. No
               further action at this time. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               __22__ day of ___August____, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.
