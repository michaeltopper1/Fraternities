               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3312 SYNOPSIS: Report of graffiti in a
               stairwell of the Compton Union Building. Photos taken and the
               graffiti will be cleaned by management. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 08/04/15 around 0925 hrs I was
               dispatched to a report of graffiti in a stairwell of the
               Compton Union Building. Upon my arrival I contacted the
               reporting party, later identified as Jessica A Serio
               (04/28/88), who told me the following. Serio explained she had
               received an email from a member of the custodial crew around
               2015 hrs explaining they had noticed graffiti in the stairwell
               between the second and third floor. Serio lead me into the
               stairwell next to the elevator and I noticed what appeared to
               be writing in a permanent marker saying "black lives matter"
               along with graffiti found further up the stairwell saying "all
               power to the people." When asked if anyone had been seen in the
               area of the graffiti I was told nothing else was mentioned. I
               took photos of the graffiti and provided Serio with my business
               card along with the case number for reference before returning
               to the WSU Police Department to complete the necessary
               paperwork. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 4th day of August,

               a car. Nothing was missing. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 08/04/15 at approximately 1930
               hours I was dispatched to a vehicle prowl. I called the
               reporting party, Abdur Rehman, and asked what happened. Rehman
               said when he returned to his vehicle he noticed his driver's
               door was open, but nothing was missing from the car. I asked if
               the vehicle doors were locked. Rehman said all the other doors
               were locked, but he did not check the open door. I told Rehman
               that most likely the door caught on something, such as a
               seatbelt when it was closing, causing it to not latch and open
               back up. I told Rehman to call me back if for some reason he
               discovers anything missing. Case closed. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               4th day of August, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #:15-W3329 SYNOPSIS: Subject processed, cited,
               and released for DUI. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               Michael P. Heaton 08/12/93 Cite/Release DUI C09955 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 08/05/15 at approximately 0114 hours I was parked
               in the parking lot of Terrace Apts. off of NE Merman Dr.
               monitoring traffic. I could hear the defendant's vehicle
               approaching from the north (traveling south) as it sounded to
               be accelerating. I activated my radar (Genesis Scout) and it
               displayed a speed of 34MPH in a 25MPH speed zone. I caught up
               with the vehicle as it was turning left onto NE Valley Rd. I
               activated my emergency lights and the vehicle eventually came
               to a stop near Cove Way. I activated my VieVu camera and
               contacted the driver. I advised him of the reason for the stop
               and that the stop was being recorded. I asked the driver for
               his license, registration, and proof of insurance, which he
               provided. The driver was identified by WADL as Michael P.
               Heaton 08/12/93. While I was standing at the car I could smell
               the odor of intoxicants emitting from the vehicle. I noticed
               there was a front seat passenger as well. I could see two empty
               beer cans behind the passenger's seat. I asked Heaton how much
               he had to drink. Heaton told me he had 2 beers earlier. I asked
               Heaton if I could check his eyes and he said I could. I had
               Heaton turn and face me. I administered an HGN test with Heaton
               seated in the vehicle. I saw a lack of smooth pursuit and a
               distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation in both
               eyes. I noticed Heaton's eyes were bloodshot and watery. I
               returned to my patrol car and ran Heaton's information on my
               MDC. Heaton returned clear and current. I turned off my front
               facing emergency lights. I returned to Heaton's vehicle and
               asked if he felt ok to drive and he said he did. I asked Heaton
               if he would do some field sobriety tests and he said he would.
               I directed Heaton to the sidewalk on the south side of the
               roadway. I administered the field sobriety tests on the level
               and paved sidewalk. Lighting was provided by overhead lights
               and my flashlight. The weather was clear with an approximate
               temperature of 70 degrees. Heaton was wearing jeans, a t-shirt,
               and canvas type shoes during the tests. I explained to Heaton
               that I would be evaluating him on how well he performed the
               tests and how well he followed my instructions. I cautioned
               Heaton to not start any test until I told him to do so. The
               first test I administered was the HGN. I told Heaton to stand
               with his feet together and his arms at his sides. I told Heaton
               to follow the tip of my pen with his eyes only with out moving

               his head. I held my pen approximately 12-15 inches in front of
               Heaton's face and administered the test. I checked Heaton's
               eyes and noticed they tracked equally and had equal pupil
               sizes. I did not see resting nystagmus. I saw a lack of smooth
               pursuit and a distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum
               deviation in both eyes. I saw an onset of nystagmus at
               approximately 40 degrees in both eyes. Heaton was swaying left
               to right during the test and I could smell the odor of
               intoxicants on his breath. The next test I administered was the
               walk and turn. I told Heaton to find an imaginary straight line
               and put his left foot on the line. I told Heaton to put his
               right foot in front of his left foot touching heel to toe and
               leave his arms down at his sides. I told Heaton to stay in that
               position while I explained the test. I told Heaton that when I
               tell him to begin, to take nine steps touching heel to toe,
               watching his feet as he walked and count each step out loud. I
               told Heaton that when he gets to step nine, to leave his lead
               foot in place and using his rear foot, take small steps around
               until facing the way he came. I told Heaton to take nine steps
               back touching heel to toe and counting each step out loud. I
               told Heaton that once he started, do not stop. I reminded
               Heaton to count each step out loud, keep his arms at his sides,
               and watch his feet as he walked. I demonstrated the test and
               asked Heaton if he understood and he said yes. I told Heaton to
               begin at any time. Instruction Phase: Heaton swayed left to
               right in the instruction phase and lost his balance three
               times, having to move out of the starting position to regain
               his balance. First Nine Steps: Heaton began the test and took a
               total of 11 steps. Heaton stopped and then completed the turn
               incorrectly by taking steps with both feet. Return Nine Steps:
               Heaton stopped after the turn and then began his return steps.
               Heaton staggered on his second step and before he could bring
               his rear foot past his front foot he stepped off the line to
               the left. Heaton missed heal to toe between steps 4 & 5. The
               next test I administered was the one leg stand. I told Heaton
               to stand with his feet together and his arms at his sides. I
               told Heaton that when I tell him to begin to raise the foot of
               his choice approximately 6 inches off the ground. I told Heaton
               to point his toe forward, look at his foot, and count out loud
               by 1000's until I tell him to stop. I asked Heaton if he
               understood, and he said yes. I told Heaton to begin at any
               time. Sgt. Macy arrived on scene around this time. Heaton
               raised his right foot off the ground and began the test. Heaton
               swayed left to right during the test and thirty seconds elapsed
               on his count of 1023. The next test I administered was the PBT.
               I told Heaton the PBT did not replace the evidentiary breath
               test and it was voluntary. I asked Heaton if he would submit to
               a PBT and he said yes. I checked the PBT (FST # 62324) and
               found it in proper working condition. I asked Heaton if he knew
               the legal limit in the state of Washington for DUI and he said
               .08. I asked Heaton what he thought his level would be at and
               he said a .100. I asked Heaton if he thought he was over the
               legal limit and he said yes. Heaton gave a breath sample of
               .134 at 0127 hours. At this time it was my opinion that
               Heaton's ability to drive was impaired by alcohol. I told

               Heaton he was under arrest for DUI. I handcuffed (D/L) Heaton
               and advised him of his right to counsel. I reminded Heaton he
               was being recorded. I searched Heaton incident to arrest,
               finding no weapons or items of evidence. I placed Heaton in the
               back seat of my patrol car. Sgt. Macy remained on scene and
               facilitated the tow with Myers. I transported Heaton to Pullman
               PD for the BAC. Upon arrival I checked the Draeger instrument
               and found it working properly with the mouth tube warm to the
               touch. I read Heaton his Constitutional Rights at 0146 hours.
               Heaton said he understood his rights and signed both signature
               blocks. I checked Heaton's mouth at 0146 hours, finding no
               foreign substance. I read Heaton his Implied Consent Warning
               for Breath at 0150 hours. Heaton signed that it was read to
               him. I asked Heaton if he would submit to a breath test and he
               said he did not know what to do. I asked Heaton if he would
               like to talk with an attorney and he said he would. I contacted
               John Hart and had Heaton talk with him in Interview Room A.
               Heaton exited the Interview Room when he was done. I checked
               Heaton's mouth at 0205 hours, finding no foreign substance. I
               asked Heaton if he would submit to a breath test. Heaton
               checked the "yes" box and initialed next to it. Heaton provided
               a breath sample of .123 (IR) / .124 (EC) at 0225 hours and a
               sample of .124 (IR) / .123 (EC) at 0229 hours. The breath test
               was administered in accordance to the methods approved by the
               Washington State Toxicologist pursuant to the Washington
               Administrative Code. I provided Heaton with a copy of the
               following documents; Driver's Hearing Request, Notice of
               Hearing/Conditions of Release, Tow/Impound Form, and the breath
               test document. I issued Heaton a criminal citation for DUI. I
               explained the citation to him and provided him with a copy. I
               released Heaton from custody. Heaton was very polite and
               cooperative during my contact with him. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 5th day of August, 2015, in Pullman,

               activated my VieVu camera and contacted the driver. I told the
