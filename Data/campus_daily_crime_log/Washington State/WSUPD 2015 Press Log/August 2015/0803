               about 1134 hrs I was dispatched to an anonymous report of
               illegal drugs at the WSU Plumbing Maintenance Shop, located at
               2425 NE Grimes Way. Dispatch advised an unidentified male had
               called with the information. The male stated his brother had
               told him that drugs were in the maintenance shop. The male did
               not provide any further information, and no incoming telephone
               number was identified. I identified the maintenance shop
               supervisor as, Gregory M. Streva (DOB 03-10-1955). I contacted
               Streva on the telephone and advised him of the information.
               Streva said he had no idea who might have called and was not
               aware of any disgruntled or upset employees. Streva said he
               would contact the police department if he suspected any drug
               activity or learned who was responsible for the telephone call.
               No further action at this time. Olmstead/339 I certify and
