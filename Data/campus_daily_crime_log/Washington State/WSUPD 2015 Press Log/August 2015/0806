               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3352 SYNOPSIS:The R/P stated that a male
               driving a dark color vehicle was honking at her. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 08-06-15 I was
               dispatched to a road rage incident that ofccurred on Stadium
               Way at Grimes Way. The R/P a Bethany Balmer stated that when
               she was sitting at the intersection of Stadium Way and Grimes
               Way. She didn't start moving when the light turned green. A
               dark color vehicle that was behind her started homking its
               horn. She moved to the next intersection and the light was red.
               The driver of the other vehicle moved to the outside lane next
               to her. She looked at the driver and he was yelling out his
               window at her. She had her window closed so she didn't hear
               what he was saying. The light turned green and she started
               moving. The other vehicle sped past her and then moved into her
               lane of travel. The driver suddenly stopped and Balmer almost
               struck the other vehicle. The other vehicle then sped off and
               the last she saw of it the vehicle had turned right on Orchard
               St. She stated the driver was a college age male. The license
               she gave WHITCOM came back to a Nissan Pathfinder out of
               Seattle. There is no local on the vehicle or the registered
               owner. This does not match the description that Balmer gave me.
               I told he that we would keep an eye out for the vehicle, but
               there was no way to find out who was driving the vehicle. She
               said she understood and we ended to the call. There are no
               leads or suspects at this time...... I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
