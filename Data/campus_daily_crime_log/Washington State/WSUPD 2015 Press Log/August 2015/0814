    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: KDS/326 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3431 SYNOPSIS: Caitlin R. Ostereich was
               driving her Honda Metropolitan Moped from WB on East Main
               Street onto Stadium Way using the merging turn lane. As she
               turned, her moped slipped on some loose sand on the roadway and
               which caused her to lay the moped on the ground. Ostereich
               suffered numerous abrasions on her body from the impact with
               the roadway. The sand was on the roadway because WSU contracted
               Quality Contractors out of Deary, ID to sand blast the sidewalk
               bordering the turn lane which created a layer of black sand
               that Ostereich was unable to see. Forward to WSU Risk
               Management NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 081415 at approximately 1209 hours, I was
               dispatched to a report of a single vehicle injury collision
               that occurred at the intersection of Stadium Way near Main
               Street. Dispatch advised that the driver of a Honda
               Metropolitan moped scooter, Caitlin R. Ostereich was enroute to
               the hospital and that the construction workers assisted her in
               getting her moped scooter home following the collision. I
               contacted Ostereich via telephone and she told me that she was
               driving her scooter WB on E. Main Street in the turn lane to
               turn onto Stadium Way. As she entered the merging lane her
               scooter tires began to lose traction causing her to lay the
               scooter down in the roadway causing "road rash." Ostereich
               stated the construction workers assisted her in loading her
               scooter in a pickup and gave her a ride home. She told me that
               she then decided to go to the hospital for her injuries. I told
               her I would contact the contsruction workers and then come by
               the hospital to see her. I responded to the intersection of
               Stadium Way and Main Street and contacted Aaron P. Alexander
               who told me he works for Quality Contractors and there were
               contracted by WSU to sand blast the sidewalk as part of the
               construction project at the intersection. Alexander stated they
               started around 1000 hours, and the sand was building a sand
               layer on the roadway. He told me that Blaine E. McMahan, the
               project manager for WSU, stopped by and told them to make sure
               they were keeping the roadway swept. Alexander stated that he
               was sweeping the road from then until the time the collision
               occurred. Alexander told me the collision occurred at
               approximately 1200 hours. He stated approximately 30 minutes
               before the collision, they turned off the sand blaster and
               completely swept the area before resuming sand blasting. I
               asked Alexander what he saw and he told me he saw Ostereich
               drive to about the crosswalk where her rear tire slipped

               causing her to crash approximately 15 feet beyond the crosswalk
               in the merging lane. He estimated Ostereich's speed at
               approximately 20-25 MPH at the time of the collision. Alexander
               told me he was on the other side of Main Street at the time of
               the collision however. While standing on the sidewalk talking
               to Alexander, I was constantly getting hit by sand from the
               sand blasting going on. I noticed Alexander was sweeping the
               roadway in the area of the collision and there was several 4-6
               inch tall piles of sand along the side of the roadway.
               Alexander admitted that the sand built up quickly while they
               were sand blasting and he was trying to keep the roadway clear.
               While I was standing at the intersection, the traffic was
               nearly constant which would have made it very difficult for
               Alexander to adequately keep the roadway clear. I asked
               Alexander if there were any signs warning drivers of the sand
               in the roadway or to use caution and he told me they just had
               orange delineator candle stick cones lining the road. I told
               Alexander to move the cones blocking off the turn lane and
               forcing traffic around the merge lane due to the risks and lack
               of signage. I took pictures of the scene of the collision. I
               thanked him for his time and cleared. I responded to PRH and
               contacted Ostereich who told me she was driving approximately
               10-15 MPH approaching the intersection because of the
               construction cones lining the street. She stated she didn't see
               anyone sweeping the roadway as she approached. Ostereich stated
               that she was about in the crosswalk when her back tire slid out
               from under the bike and caused her to crash. She told me she
               was wearing her helmet at the time of the collision. Ostereich
               told me the construction workers assisted her in loading her
               moped in their pickup and provided her a ride back to her
               residence. I asked her what the approximate time of the crash
               was and she stated it was around 1130 hours. I asked her if she
               knew the license plate of her moped and she told me she didn't.
               I asked her to email me pictures of the damage to her scooter
               and a picture of the license plate and she told me she would. I
               asked her if she had insurance on her scooter and she told me
               she didn't. I asked if I could take pictures of her injuries
               and she told me I could. Ostereich showed me her injuries. Each
               knee had an approximate silver dollar sized abrasion, her left
               elbow and forearm had a dollar bill sized abrasion, her left
               pinky knuckle was scraped nearly to the bone, she had a large
               abrasion covering her right hip, her right shin was had light
               road rash, her right ankle had a silver dollar sized abrasion,
               her right forearm had bruising and scrapes, both palms had
               minor scrapes, and her left hip had a light abrasion. Ostereich
               told me she didn't think she had any broken bones from the
               collision. I thanked Ostereich for her time and provided her
               with my card and case number. I explained I was going to
               forward my report of the office of Risk Management at WSU and
               she could contact them to file a claim if she chose to. She
               thanked me for my time and I cleared. I called Blaine McMahan
               at WSU Capital Planning and advised him of the collision. He
               told me that Quality Contracting was there at approximately
               0900 hours, and he stopped by shortly after they started sand
               blasting. He told me that while he was there, there was sand

               building up on the roadway and he told them to keep the roadway
               clear of sand while they were sand blasting the sidewalk.
               McMahan told me he left the area expecting they would take care
               of the sand in the roadway. I told him I was forwarding my
               report to the Office of Risk Management and he thanked me for
               the heads up. Forward to Risk Management. I certify and declare

               Officer responded to the area and the odor was not detected.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 08-14-
               15 at approximately 1235 hours I was dispatched to the report
               of the odor of marijuana coming from Eastlick Hall, located at
               300 NE Veterans Way. Dispatch advised the report was coming
               from a third party, but it was coming from the area of room
               #381. I arrived on scene. As soon as I got to the third floor I
               spoke with Eric H. Roalson (DOB 09-26-69). I asked him if he
               smelled the odor of marijuana coming from this floor. Roalson
               told me he could smell the odor of marijuana coming from a
               stairwell in Eastlick at about 1100 hours. I asked him how
               strong the odor was, he said he could smell it strongly when he
               entered the stairwell from the third floor, but by the time he
               reached the second floor the odor was not very strong. Roalson
               walked me over to the stairwell near room #381. I could not
               smell the odor of marijuana coming from the third floor or the
               stairwell. I cleared the scene. No further action. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the

               hours I was driving southbound on Stadium Way near Grimes Way
               when I noticed a white Chevrolet Tahoe heading northbound on
               Stadium Way with it's high beams on. As I passed the Tahoe, the
               driver did not dim their high beams. I turned around to
               initiate a traffic stop. When I caught up to the Tahoe I
               noticed the third brake light was not working. I initiated a
               traffic stop at Stadium Way and Ferdinand's Lane. I contacted
               the driver, David Charles Ferber 08/13/63, identified myself,
               informed Ferber that I was recording, and explained the reason
               for the stop. I asked Ferber for his driver's license and
               Ferber said he did not have one. I asked Ferber why he was
               driving if he did not have a driver's license and he said, "I
               don't know, I shouldn't have been." I asked Ferber if he had an
               ID with him and Ferber provided me with his Washington
               Identification Card. Ferber also provided me with his vehicle
               registration but he could not find his proof of insurance. I
               returned to my patrol car and ran Ferber through dispatch.
               Dispatch stated Ferber's drivers return stated he was suspended
               in the third degree. About this time Sgt. Macy arrived on
               scene. I filled out a Sector citation for DWLS 3rd degree. Sgt.
               Macy contacted Ferber's wife, Bobbi Jo Ferber 01/05/65, who
               provided her WADL. Bobbi's driver's license was clear. I
               returned to Ferber and asked him to speak with me on the
               sidewalk. Once on the sidewalk I asked Ferber if he knew his
               driver's license was suspended and Ferber said he did. I
               explained the citation to Ferber and provided him with his
               copy. I warned Ferber that if he was found driving again in
               Whitman County while suspended he could be booked into the
               Jail. Ferber stated he understood. Ferber was told he was free
               to go and all units cleared. END OF REPORT I certify and
