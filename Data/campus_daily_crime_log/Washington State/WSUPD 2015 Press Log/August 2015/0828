               (DOB 02-16-1957) reported telephone harassment. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 08-28-2015 at about
               1027 hrs I was dispatched to a report of telephone harassment
               in Sloan Hall, located at 405 NE Spokane Street. I arrived on
               scene and contacted the complainant, Liv M. Haselbach (DOB 02-
               16-1957), in her office (Sloan Hall #109). Haselbach stated she
               had received some harassing telephone calls on her work
               telephone. Haselbach's work telephone number was identified as:
               509-335-4874. Haselbach explained that earlier this week she
               had received two telephone calls from a male caller. The male
               caller told Haselbach that he had been receiving telephone
               calls from her work telephone number. Haselbach said she told
               the male that she did not call his number. Haselbach did not
               remember when she had received the calls. Haselbach said on 08-
               28-2015 at about 0900 hrs she received a voicemail message on
               her work telephone from the same male caller. The male caller
               was upset, used obscenities, and accused Haselbach of calling
               his telephone number again. Haselbach played the voicemail
               message for me, and I recorded the message. The recording was
               later downloaded into the permanent digital evidence file.
               Haselbach identified the incoming telephone number as: 646-730-
               6077. I discussed the situation with Haselbach, and it was
               decided that I would attempt to contact the male caller. I
               called the suspect telephone number and spoke to an
               unidentified male who stated he resided in the "Bronx" area of
               New York City. The male was somewhat uncooperative and was
               upset that he had been receiving telephone calls from
               Haselbach. I tried to explain to the male that Haselbach had
               not made the calls and something else, such as caller ID
               spoofing, might be the cause. The male would not listen to me
               and said Haselbach was a liar. I warned the male about calling
               and harassing Haselbach and suggested that he contact his
               cellular telephone company to have Haselbach's number blocked.
               The male agreed to not call Haselbach again, and told me if he
               received another telephone call from her number, then he would
               call the police. I concluded the telephone call with the male.
               I advised Haselbach of the outcome of my telephone conversation
               with the male caller. I suggested to Haselbach that she contact
               WSU Information Technology and inquire about either obtaining a
               new work telephone number or having the male caller's telephone
               number blocked. Haselbach told me she would obtain a new work
               telephone number. I told Haselbach to contact me if she

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3776 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched to a
               report of property damage. The complaint reported that her
               vehicle was damaged. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 08-28-2015 at about 1040 hrs I was dispatched to
               a report of property damage in the Center for Undergraduate
               Education Building (CUE) parking garage, located at 300 NE Troy
               Lane. I contacted the complainant, Megan M. Blyzka (DOB 04-26-
               1992), on the telephone. Blyzka said on 08-27-2015 at about
               1015 hrs she parked her white, 2015 Jeep Cherokee (WA Lic.
               AVS2439) on the 4th floor of the CUE parking garage. The
               vehicle was parked with the front end facing into the parking
               space. She returned to her vehicle later that same day at about
               1530 hrs and discovered that her vehicle had been damaged.
               Blyzka said she found a black mark and small dent on the rear
               driver side door of her vehicle. The damage is estimated to be
               $300.00. Blyzka said she noticed a black, 2006 Kia Sportage (WA
               Lic. ADN5688) parked next to her vehicle. The Kia was parked
               along the driver side of her vehicle and was positioned with
               the rear end facing into the parking space. Blyzka examined the
               Kia and found what appeared to be fresh white paint transfer on
               the edge of the Kia's front driver side door. Blyzka believes
               this paint transfer was from her vehicle. Blyzka looked at the
               positioning of both vehicles and concluded that if the front
               driver side door of the Kia was opened fully, it would have
               struck the rear driver side door of her vehicle. Blyzka said
               she believes the door from the Kia struck her vehicle and
               caused the damage. Blyzka said she photographed the scene
               (including photographs of the paint marks on both vehicles) and
               left a note on the Kia with instructions for the driver to
               contact her. Blyzka said she has not been contacted by the
               driver of the Kia and requested police assistance. Blyzka
               provided me with her photographs. The photographs have been
               downloaded into Spillman and attached to this case. I
               identified the registered owner of the Kia as, Porsha K. Gilman
               (DOB 03-15-1993). Investigation continues. Olmstead/339 I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of

               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Rochelle, Katelyn E (10/10/94) 2. NARRATIVE: On
               08/28/15 around 1724 hrs I was dispatched to a request for a
               welfare check on a female identified as Katelyn E Rochelle
               (10/10/94). After locating an address of apartment E-18 located
               at 540 SE Forest Way, Ofc Petlovany and I responded. As I
               responded I contacted the complainant, later identified as
               Bethany A Meyer (08/12/93) who told me the following. Meyer
               explained she had noticed Rochelle had posted several messages
               that had been disturbing to her. She went on to tell me
               Rochelle had been asking what would happen if she mixed codeine
               and clonazepam. A short time later Rochelle posted again she
               had taken the pills. Upon seeing this Meyer became concerned
               and contacted the WSU Police Department. Before ending the call
               with her I asked Meyer if she would send me screen shots of
               what Rochelle had been posting and told she would. I met
               Petlovany a short time later and we tried to contact Rochelle
               at apartment E-18. We found Rochelle no longer lived in the
               apartment and it was currently occupied by new residents. We
               cleared a short time later and I requested Whitcom contact the
               phone company to ping the location of the phone. A short time
               later Whitcom told me the phone was pinging within 7 meters of
               600 NE Kamiaken St. I asked them to pass the information along
               to the Pullman Police Department, which they did. Some time
               later Ofc Winegardner radioed me and told me they had located
               Rochelle at the location provided. I met him, Ofc Emerson, and
               Ofc Bray there and showed Winegardner and Emerson the screen
               shots I had been sent. Winegardner told me Rochelle had agreed
               to go to the hospital voluntarily and I cleared a short time
               later. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 28th day of August,

               the RP, Megan A. Taylor (061079), who told me at approximately
               1800 hours she was riding on N Fairway near the Mariott. In the
               areas of the medians she felt vehicles were coming too close to
               her. A series of vehicles came by her and the driver of the
               last one told her that she should move to the side of the road
               to be safer. Taylor got the first few digits of the plate and
               later saw the vehicle (WA/ATK7762) at her apartment complex.
               The plate returned to a Cecilia Eiroa Lledo (082393). I
               contacted Eiroa Lledo at her apartment and confirmed her
               vehicle was the one in question. She admitted to saying
               something to the bicyclist. I informed her that the rider did
               not take it as friendly advice. I educated Eiroa Lledo as to
               the rules of the road and cleared. Nothing follows. I certify

               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Cody M. Arns (010897) Conduct MIP 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 082815 at approximately 2212 hours I was driving eastbound
               on NE Fairway Rd approaching NE Fairway Ln when I observed a
               vehicle (WA/C89821B) turning northbound from NE Fairwway Rd
               onto NE Fairway Ln without signaling left. I activated my
               emergency lights and stopped the vehicle. I contacted the
               driver, Cody M. Arns (010897), and informed him of why I
               stopped him and that we were being recorded. He provided the
               necessary documents and I returned to my vehicle. He was run
               without incident. Cpl. Kuhrt had arrived and noticed a Busch
               Light beer can in the bed of the truck. I had Arns step out of
               the vehicle to speak with me. He did not know how the beer had
               gotten there. I asked for permission to search his vehicle and
               explained he had the right to refuse, restrict, and revoke that
               consent. He allowed me to search the vehicle. He also retrieved
               the beer from the truck. Intern Arnevick searched the vehicle
               without incident. Nothing of evidentiary value was found. I had
               Arns pour the beer out. I told him I would just be referring
               him to Student Conduct. I also mentioned to him WSU Counseling
               as he had been detoxed about 2 weeks prior and still had beer
               with him. We cleared. Nothing follows. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               29th day of August, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC:MTK/336 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3793 SYNOPSIS: Responded for a suicide
               at Stimson Hall. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Baily
               D. Brindle 07/18/95 Deceased 2. NARRATIVE: On 08/28/15 at
               approximately 2250 hours WSUPD was dispatched to a suicide
               attempt at Stimson Hall room 213. Ofc. Welter and I got to the
               scene and went to room 213. Two male subjects were inside the
               door way and pointed to the A room and said that he was in
               there. I noticed the door was locked, but it was not latched.
               As I pushed the door open I saw a male subject hanging from the
               bunk bed on the west side of the room. The subject was hanging
               by a yellow nylon type rope. He was facing to the northwest
               (away from me) slouched forward with the tops of his feet and
               shins touching the ground. I cut the rope and guided him to the
               ground to his right (north). As the subject went to the ground
               I noticed his arms were rigid with balled up fists. I looked at
               his mouth and saw his lips were blue/purple along with his
               tongue. I noticed his feet were straight back and appeared
               rigid. I could see the subject was clearly deceased. I told
               Ofc. Welter to keep everyone out of the room, which he did. I
               advised Whitcom to have the medics downgrade as they were
               responded "echo". I asked for Whitcom to have Asst. Chief
               Hansen contact me and to notify the coroner. I looked around
               the room and saw nothing out of the ordinary. There appeared to
               be no signs of a struggle and the room looked like a normal
               college dorm. I took photos of the scene and later saved them
               to the computer. Pullman Fire personal arrived on scene and
               placed an EKG monitor onto the subject. The Fire personal
               agreed that the subject was dead. Ofc. Welter and Ofc.
               Westerman interviewed the roommates. See their supplements for
               complete details. Intern Isop remained posted outside the room.
               WSU Housing personal responded and set up an Ad Hoc counseling
               services area in the TV lounge in the basement. I spoke with
               Asst. Chief Hansen and notified him at approximately 2257
               hours. In an attempt to identify the subject I began looking
               for an ID in the room. I located an ID on the desk on the north
               side of the room belonging to Dakota McFadden, who we learned
               was the roommate of the subject. I continued looking and in a
               desk drawer of the desk on the east side of the room I located
               a prescription bottle for Baily Brindle. I had Whitcom check in
               locals for Brindle and they located a Baily D. Brindle 07/18/95
               living in Stimson Hall Room 213. I was able to locate a Cougar
               Card in the subject's right pocket with a matching name and a
               photo matching him. Coroner Annie Pillers arrived on scene at

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
               approximately 2359 hours. Pillers identified the subject as
               Baily D. Brindle 07/18/95. I had Whitcom contact Everett PD to
               make a notification. Due to calls to service, they were not
               able to call me until 0156 hours. I spoke with Deputy Peckham
               (Snohomish County SO). I explained the situation to him and
               provided him with the address of Brindle's mother. At
               approximately 0228 hours Deputy Peckham called back and told me
               he attempted notification at the house, but no one answered. I
               asked Deputy Peckham to check again later. Coroner Travis
               Anderson arrived on scene and assisted Pillers. Pillers located
               a receipt in Brindle's right front pocket. The receipt was time
               stamped on 08/28/15 at 16:25:15 hours. The top item of the
               receipt was poly rope. Kimball's Funeral Home arrived and
               removed Brindle. I located the packaging of the rope in the
               waste basket in the common area, which I showed the coroners.
               Coroner Anderson located Brindle's wallet and an Alaska DL. I
               took a photo of the license. We locked the door and cleared. I
               responded to the Hall Director's (Andrew Beck) office. I met
               with Housing Director Edwin Hamada, Assistant Director Kate
               Gannon, and Beck. I explained to them that there had not been
               notification made yet. I asked if it would be possible to speak
               with Brindle's friend Hector Morrell (interviewed by Ofc.
               Welter). Morrell came into the office and I asked him if he
               knew Brindle's family. Morrell explained that they went to high
               school together so he did. I confirmed with Morrell that
               Brindle's mom Joan still lived at 5329 141ST Pl. SE. Morrell
               said she did and that Brindle's parents were divorced. Morrell
               said Brindle's dad lived in Alaska, but did not know his name.
               Morrell said Joan only owned one car, a silver Kia Sorento. I
               thanked Morrell for his assistance. I called Deputy Peckham and
               asked him if there was a Kia in the driveway when he attempted
               notification. Deputy Peckham said he ran the plate and there
               was a Kia. Deputy Peckham told me the lights in the house were
               on and there was a partially packed suitcase at the base of the
               stairs. Deputy Peckham responded back to the address at
               approximately 0400 hours again with no results. I responded
               back to the WSUPD and checked the student directory. I was able
               to locate Brindle's father, David D. Brindle 10/19/66. David
               had a Mukilteo WA address, but also had a Kenai Alaska return.
               Both Brindle and David have the same Kenai AL return. Whitcom
               contacted Kenai PD. Ofc. James Harris called me and I gave him
               the information and requested he attempt to contact David to
               confirm he was Brindle's father and to make the notification.
               At 0745 hours Ofc. Harris called me and told me he notified
               David by phone. David confirmed his son Bailey goes to school
               at WSU. I notified Coroner Pillers and Asst. Chief Hansen of
               the notification. There is a discrepancy in the spelling of
               Brindle's first name. Brindle's Cougar Card and Alaska license
               both have his first name as Baily and his Washington return has
               it as Bailey. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 29th day of
               August, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               driving westbound on East Main St. approaching Stadium Way when
               I noticed a vehicle that was driving on East Main St. in front
               of me. The vehicle WA AIU5805 caught my attention because it's
               driver's side tail light was not functioning. I initiated a
               traffic stop on the vehicle, turning on my overhead lights. The
               vehicle stopped on Nevada St. off of Stadium Way. I contacted
               the driver, Courtney R. Marable (041690), and told her the
               reason for the stop and the stop was being recorded. I asked
               for her driver's license, vehicle registration, and proof of
               insurance. She provided me with her driver's license and proof
               of insurance. She told me she had a ticket that she mailed the
               payment for but she thought her driver's license might be
               suspended. I returned to my vehicle and ran Marable's driver's
               license on my MDC. Her drivers return indicated her driving
               status was DWLS 3rd degree. I returned to the vehicle and
               advised Marable her driver's license was suspended and she was
               under arrest. I advised her to remain in the vehicle and I
               would issue her a citation. I completed a citation for DWLS 3rd
               degree and issued it to Marable. I explained the citation to
               her and she received her copy. Marable contacted a friend to
               come drive her vehicle. I instructed her to wait for her friend
               and not to drive the vehicle or she would be arrested again for
               DWLS. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of

               monitoring traffic on Stadium Way near B St. when I saw a
               vehicle turn northbound on to Stadium Way from Valley Rd. The
               vehicle caught my attention because it turned into the inside
               (left) lane instead of the outside (right) lane as it should
               have. I pulled out behind the vehicle and initiated a traffic
               stop, turning on my over head lights. The vehicle, AWH9325,
               stopped in the parking lot at Taco Bell. I contacted the
               driver, Alexander L. Jones (011095), and told him the reason
               for the stop. I asked for his driver's license, vehicle
               registration, and proof of insurance. He said he did not have
               his license with him but provided the other information. I
               returned to my patrol vehicle and ran Jones' information on my
               MDC. His drivers return indicated his driving status was DWLS

               status was suspended. I issued him criminal citation #5Z0347691

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: BRW/325 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3797 SYNOPSIS: Report of a male wearing
               a ski mask walking the halls of Community Duncan Dunn. The male
               was reported to have a knife in his hand. The subject was not
               located. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 08/29/15 at approximately 0157 hours Ofc. Petlovany and I
               responded to Community Duncan Dunn where a male had been seen
               walking the halls with a ski mask on. The male with the mask
               was reported to having a knife. Details for the call were still
               coming into dispatch as we arrived. Ofc. Petlovany and I
               responded directly to the third floor where the male had last
               been seen. While searching the 3rd floor, dispatch stated that
               this call was roughly 15 minutes cold. Dispatch also stated
               that the male had been seen on the 1st floor. After completing
               the search of the 3rd floor we continued onto the 2nd. On the
               second floor we located several people in the study lounge. The
               people stated they were the ones called about the male. We
               received the quick description of a short Asian male, wearing a
               black shirt and blue jeans. They stated the ski mask was black.
               Due to the potential of someone still in the building, Intern
               Isop and Intern Arnevick were instructed to interview and take
               statements from the witnesses while we cleared the building.
               Ofc. Petlovany and I cleared the rest of the building and found
               nobody matching that description. We went back to the study
               room where the witnesses were. I spoke to Shadric L. McDonnell
               12/20/95, who stated he saw the male in the hallway when a
               female in their group tried to pull the mask off from behind
               the male turned around a pulled out a folding knife and held it
               in the air. The male continued to walk backwards away from the
               female and then turned around continuing down the hall in the
               direction he was going before the female tried to take the mask
               off. McDonnell stated he was 70% sure that the Asian male he
               saw lives in a room down the hall that had a biohazard bag
               taped to the front of the door. Ofc. Petlovany and I knocked
               room 235 but nobody answered. When I knocked on the door a saw
               an Asian male poke his head out and look at us. The male
               matched the description and I contacted him. I asked the male,
               later identified as Justin L. Lam Po Tang 10/22/95, what room
               was his. Tang pointed to the room with the biohazard bag on it,
               room 235. I asked Tang if he carries a knife on him and Tang
               began patting his pants pockets. Tang said no and I told Tang
               that by him patting his pockets was and indication to me that
               he usually carries a knife. I asked where the knife was and
               Tang said his room. I asked Tang to get it and he did. Tang

               went to his room and retrieved three throwing knives from on
               his desk. When Tang grabbed the knives he had to move several
               items off the desk to grab the knives. It was clear the either
               Tang had not used the knives recently or that he had attempted
               to hide the knives. Ofc. Petlovany asked if he could take the
               knives to show someone and Tang said that was fine. Ofc.
               Petlovany later told me that the witnesses stated that the
               knives Tang had provided was not the knives they saw. I will
               attempt follow up in the next few days. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               I was dispatched to an unconscious male in room 809 of
               Stephenson South. Upon arrival I found Raul A. Morales
               06/17/96, laying on his stomach in the middle of the room. A
               friend, not identified, stated he came home and found Morales
               intoxicated on the ground. The friend did not know what Morales
               had drank. I found Morales breathing but unresponsive. I told
               Morales that if he did not respond to me I would have to
               inflict pain to make sure he was still responsive. Morales did
               not answer. I pinched the skin along his ribs and Morales
               winced. Morales was still not answering my questions however.
               Once medics arrived Morales still was not responding to
               questions. Medics determined that Morales needed to be taken to
               PRH for an alcohol detox. Once medics took custody of Morales I
               cleared the scene. END OF REPORT I certify and declare under

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3802 SYNOPSIS: Subject called in her
               boyfriend was not breathing due to an allergic reaction. CPR
               was initiated upon arrival and patient was transported to PRH.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Brent A. Unroe 10/05/97
               Transported PRH 2. NARRATIVE: On 08/29/15 at approximately 0527
               hours Cpl. Kuhrt and I responded to an echo response for a not
               breathing male at the intersection of Stadium Way and
               Ferdinand's Lane. Dispatch stated the subject was on the
               sidewalk. Upon arrival I found a Dodge Dakota stopped in the
               roadway. I saw Mackenzie Rae Kellogg 07/20/95, cradling the
               head of, Brent Adam Unroe 10/05/97, who was lying on his back
               on the sidewalk. I ran up to Unroe and noticed he had a blank
               stare on his face and his lips were blue. Kellogg told me that
               she believed Unroe was having an allergic reaction. Kellogg
               said Unroe was allergic to nuts and tree nuts. Kellogg said
               Unroe had already injected himself in the leg with an EpiPen.
               Unroe was warm to the touch and I could feel a pulse in his
               chest. Unroe was attempting to suck air in but it appeared very
               little was going in. We rolled Unroe onto his side to see if he
               was choking but nothing came out. Unroe was trying to sit up
               but he did not have the strength. We placed Unroe on his side
               so he did not aspirate on anything. We were trying to talk to
               Unroe as medics were en route. Unroe started to lose
               consciousness and Cpl. Kuhrt could feel his pulse weaken. At
               that point Unroe stopped breathing and went limp. I had Intern
               Isop take Mackenzie to my patrol car as Cpl. Kuhrt and I began
               CPR. I hooked the AED up to Unroe and after it analyzed his
               heart rate, the AED advised no shock needed. I started chest
               compressions and Cpl. Kuhrt provided breaths. In between
               compressions we rolled Unroe onto his side so the fluid in his
               airway could drain. We continued CPR for approximately five
               minutes until medics arrived. Just prior to the medics arriving
               we were able to get a strong pulse and Unroe began to breath
               slightly in. Once medics arrived on scene I went to talk to
               Mackenzie who was in my patrol car. Mackenzie told me that
               Unroe had eaten a Jimmy John's sandwich at approximately 0200
               hours. Mackenzie stated that Unroe had a suspicion that there
               might have been nuts in the bread. Unroe had felt fine and
               Mackenzie stayed up with Unroe to keep an eye on him. After a
               few hours Unroe began to complain of an itchy throat but
               believed he was just being paranoid. Mackenzie set an alarm for
               every 30 minutes on her phone to check on Unroe. Mackenzie
               stated that somewhere around 0500 hours, Unroe got out of bed

               and went to the bathroom where he used his EpiPen. Mackenzie
               told Unroe that she was taking him to the hospital. Mackenzie
               walked Unroe to her truck and began to drive Unroe when Unroe
               stopped breathing. At that point she stopped the truck and
               called 911. I asked Mackenzie if she knew of this happening
               before and Mackenzie said she believed the last time Unroe had
               such a severe reaction was when he was 11 years old. Mackenzie
               said she has been dating Unroe for about two years and has not
               seen Unroe have a reaction before. I told Mackenzie that Unroe
               would be transported to PRH in the ambulance and I would take
               her to PRH in my patrol car. Mackenzie was so shaken up and
               emotional I did not think it was safe for her to drive. With
               Mackenzie's permission I had Intern Isop drive her truck to PRH
               so she could have it when she needed. I followed the ambulance
               to PRH and checked Mackenzie in. Once at PRH a female, not
               identified, was already there who knew Mackenzie. The female
               said she was best friends with Unroe's mother. Seeing that
               Mackenzie already had a support system in place, I asked
               Mackenzie if there was anything else I could do to help her.
               Mackenzie said no. I provided Mackenzie with my business card
               and contact info. I told Mackenzie to contact me if there way
               anything I could do. Assistant Chief Hansen was notified of the
               situation. I will have a dayshift Officer contact PRH to check
               up on Unroe. END OF NARRATIVE I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 29th day of

               that she had been assaulted and robbed by three individuals in
               a nearby field. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: *** not finished or proof read**** On 08-29-2015 at
               about 0608 hrs I was dispatched to a report of a suspicious
               person at the Marriott Residence Inn, located at 1255 NE North
               Fairway Road. The complainant, Jessica L. Lawrence (DOB 11-23-
               1993), reported that a female, wearing a sports bra and covered
               in dirt, had wandered into the hotel lobby. The female stated
               she had been assaulted but was not providing much information
               to hotel staff members. Lawrence is a hotel employee. I arrived
               on scene and Lawrence directed me to a female sitting in the
               lobby. I noticed that the female was wearing a sports bra and
               jeans and had a wadded up shirt on the table. I observed that
               the female was covered in dirt, and her clothing was soiled.
               The female had been wiping the dirt from her face with a towel
               given to her by hotel staff. I contacted the female, who was
               later identified as Abagale M. St Mars (DOB 12-26-1997). St
               Mars was 17 years old. I asked St Mars if she needed assistance
               and explained to her that I had been told she had been
               assaulted. St Mars was uncooropporaive, and her answers to my
               questions were evasive and vague. St Mars told me she did not
               want to report anything to the police department and told me
               she was trying to contact a friend to pick her up. While
               speaking with St Mars, I noticed she appeared to be texting
               messages on her cellular telephone and was not paying attention
               to our conversation. I noticed that her cellular telephone
               appeared to be an iPhone 6. St Mars told me she was walking to
               campus early this morning, maybe within the last hour. St Mars
               said she was walking through a field near the Residence Inn and
               was "jumped" by three males. St Mars was not sure of the
               location of the field but told me she remembered "short weeds"
               in the field. St Mars told me the males "tackled" her and
               pushed her face into the ground. St Mars said the males took
               her wallet and "sprinted off". St Mars described the suspects
               as two black males but could not remember what the third male
               looked like. St Mars did not provide any additional information
               about the incident. She did not appear to be injured and
               declined medical treatment. St Mars told me she was staying
               with a friend in a residence hall and was hoping to return
               there. St Mars is from Deer Park, Washington. I explained to St

               Mars that she was a juvenile, and I would be contacting her
               parents. St Mars provided me with questionable and vague
               information about her parents and told me her adult sister
               "Jessica" was coming to get her. At one point, I asked St Mars
               if she had any photo identification. I watched as she removed a
               wallet from her pant pocket and removed a high school
               identification card. I recalled that St Mars had told me
               earlier her wallet had been stolen. Officer Jones arrived on
               scene to assist. During the course of my investigation, I
               learned that St Mars had provided me with false information
               about her parents and had given me an incorrect telephone
               number. I also learned that Jessica was not her sister but was
               only a friend from Spokane, Washington. With the assitance of
               the Spokane County Sheriff's Office Dispatch, I identified St
               Mars's mother as: Penny B. Wheeler (DOB 04-20-1966). I
               contacted Wheeler on the telephone. In order to ensure that I
               was actually speaking with Wheeler, I confirmed her date of
               birth and social security number. I explained the situation to
               Wheeler and asked what she wanted me to do with St Mars.
               Wheeler directed me to stay with St Mars, and she arranged for
               an adult friend to drive to Pullman from Spokane to get St
               Mars. The adult friend was identified as Jason A. Lee (DOB 08-
               26-1971). While I was speaking with Wheeler on the telephone,
               Officer Jones talked with St Mars. St Mars told Officer Jones
               that it was two males and a female who had robbed her. St Mars
               also told Officer Jones that the suspects took $40.00 to $50.00
               from inside her wallet but did not take her wallet or cellular
               telephone. Officer Jones checked the fields and open areas
               around the Residence Inn but did not locate any footprints or
               evidence supporting St Mars's account. Wheeler and I both
               questioned St Mars about the validity of her report, but St
               Mars was adament she was assaulted and robbed. I transported St
               Mars to the police department and stayed with her until Lee
               arrived. At about 0942 hrs Lee arrived at the police
               department, and I released St Mars to him. No further action at
               this time. not finished.................... Olmstead/339
