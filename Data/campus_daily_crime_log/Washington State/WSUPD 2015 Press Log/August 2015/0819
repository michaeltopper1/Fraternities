               Police and fire arrived on scene and determined it was a false
               alarm, no emergency. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 08-20-15 at approximately 0207 hours I was
               dispatched to a report of an audible alarm coming from the USDA
               Greenhouse, located at 2242 East Grimes Way. Dispatch advised
               WSU Facilities Operations was reporting it, but had no other
               details. Pullman Fire was dispatched to respond to the
               building. I arrived on scene. I could hear the audible alarm
               sounding, but it shut off a few seconds after I arrived. I
               walked around the building and did not see any signs of fire or
               an intruder. Sgt. Griffin arrived on scene and walked the
               building as well. Pullman Fire arrived on scene. We were unable
               to gain entry to the building because we do not have keys and
               there is no Knox Box on the building. Dispatch advised the
               responsible for the building would be responding in a little
               bit, and he did not want us to search the building. The
               responsible determined it was a false alarm. We all cleared the
               scene. No further action. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
