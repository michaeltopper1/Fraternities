               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3653 SYNOPSIS: Report of a harassing
               behavior at Northside Residence Hall. The subject was contacted
               and warned about continuing the behavior. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Jenkins, Kemonee T (04/22/97) Warned
               Harassment 2. NARRATIVE: On 08/23/15 around 1338 hrs I was
               dispatched to a report of a cold assault and harassment which
               had occurred in the Northside Residence Hall on 08/22/15. I
               contacted the complainant, later identified as Stephanie P Cho
               (01/24/97) and was told the following. Cho explained around
               0145 hrs she had been in the sitting in the lobby of the
               Northside Residence Hall when an individual, later identified
               as Kemonee T Jenkins (04/22/97) walked in. Cho told me she
               recognized Jenkins as living next door to her and as a member
               of the football team. Jenkins came over and sat down next to
               Cho and placed his hand on top of her thigh. Cho told me she
               had not been hurt and after removing his hand Jenkins did not
               try to place it on her again. Shortly after this Cho told me
               she returned to her room and was awaiting a friend of hers to
               arrive, while with her roommate. A short time later someone
               knocked on her door, and after approximately 1 minute they
               opened the door. Cho told me Jenkins was down the hallway and
               she apologized and told him she thought he was someone else
               before closing the door. A short time later Cho's friend, whom
               she identified as Kirkland Parker, arrived and was let into the
               room. Shortly after Parker arrived, Jenkins began knocking at
               the door. The door was not answered before Jenkins began what
               was described as pounding on the door before returning to his
               room (526 Northside Residence Hall.) At this point I was told
               both Jenkins and Parker are football players. Parker left the
               room and walked next door to speak with Jenkins after which he
               returned with no other problems from Jenkins. I asked Cho if
               she had been hurt when Jenkins grabbed her and was told she had
               not. She went on to tell me she simply wanted him to leave her
               alone and was fearful of things escalating. We discussed this
               issue and several options at this point. Cho told me she would
               like me to speak with Jenkins and ask him to leave her alone
               and I told her I would do that. Prior to leaving I provided Cho
               with my business card and case number for reference and told
               her if she had any other problems or concerns to get in contact
               with me. She told me she would and I left to try and locate
               Jenkins. A short time later I contacted him at the Football
               Operations Building where we spoke and I was told the
               following. When I asked Jenkins if he was aware of why I wanted

               to speak with him he told me he had no idea. I asked him about
               what had happened last night in the lobby of the Northside
               Residence Hall. Jenkins told me he didn't recall a great deal
               and admitted he had been out drinking alcohol during the
               evening. As we continued to speak I noticed he appeared to be
               nervous and was playing with his hands as we continued to
               speak. I explained what Cho had described to me as occurring in
               the lobby and at her door. Jenkins lowered his head and told me
               he didn't recall any of that. He continued and told me he did
               recall having a brief conversation with Parker, but could not
               recall the substance of the conversation before Parker left and
               he went to sleep. We discussed this at length at which point I
               explained Cho simply wanted him to leave her alone and not have
               any further issues. She went on to tell me she did not wish to
               persue criminal charges at this time. Jenkins apologized to me
               and asked if it would be all right to apologize to Cho as well.
               I told him this was not the time to do that and explained he
               could be courteous and civil if her were to see her. I added
               seeking her out was probably not the best idea and he told me
               he would leave her alone and not escalate the situation any
               further. Prior to clearing I provided him with my business card
               and told him if he had any questions or concerns to get a hold
               of me and was told he would. I cleared a short time later and
               prior to leaving the building spoke with Antonio Huffman and
               made him aware of the situation. Huffman thanked me for the
               information and after speaking with him I cleared the call.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 23rd day of August, 2015, in

               resident adviser for the second floor of Gannon Hall. Pool
               stated that a sign up sheet had been posted on the wall near
               the elevator in the west stairwell on the second floor. Pool
               noticed that someone had written the following statements on
               the sheet: "deys nuts nigga" "suck my ass" Pool believed the
               statements were written on the sheet sometime between 2130 hrs
               on 08-22-2015 and 1330 hrs on 08-23-2015. Pool had already
               removed the sheet from the wall and showed it to me. I
               photographed the sheet, and the photographs were downloaded
               into Spillman and attached to the case. Pool did not have any
               idea who had written the statements on the sign up sheet. I

               gone. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               08-23-15, Schuyler A. Shannon (04-09-93) parked his 1998
               Mercedes E320 (WA/391UBT) on Campus Street, near Community
               Hall. He said he parked his Dark Gray 4 door car at
               approximately 0900 hours on 08-23-15. He said he was walking
               around the area and saw his car in the same location at
               approximately 1100 hours on 08-23-15. He said he returned to
               the area at approximately 1615 hours on 08-23-15 and his car
               was gone. Shannon said he has the only set of keys to the
               vehicle and he said he did not let anyone borrow the vehicle.
               He said his parents own the vehicle out right and doesn't owe
               any money on it. He said he does not keep a second set of keys
               for the vehicle and it has an "Electronic Start" system. He has
               no idea who may have taken his car. He said he has a Department
               of Defense sticker on the lower driver's side front window of
               the car which allows him to gain access to military bases. He
               said he also had an orange air freshener hanging from his rear
               view mirror. Shannon said he isn't totally familiar with
               Pullman, but is sure he parked his car on Campus Street near
               Community Hall. I checked the Washington State University
               "AIMS" program and did not see any indication they towed any
               vehicles on 08-23-15. The WSU Police Department did not respond
               to any Vehicle Tow calls or calls relating to Shannon's
               vehicle. Whitcom did not have any record of any vehicle tows
               from campus today. Officer Petlovany drove in and around the
               described area and was unable to locate the vehicle. I typed up
               a "Stolen Vehicle Form" and Officer Westerman took the form to
               Shannon for him to read and sign. After Shannon signs the form,
               Officer Westerman will take the form to Whitcom so they can
               enter it into the National Data base for Stolen Vehicles.
               Nothing further at this time. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 23rd day of
               August, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               of Mari/ MIP NARRATIVE: On 08/23/15 at about 2117 hours I was
               dispatched to a drugs call at Stephenson North Hall room 1113.
               I called and talked to the reporting party, hall director
               Joshua McPhatter. He was advised by RA's that they smelled
               marijuana coming from room 1113 in Stephenson North Hall at
               about 2103 hours. McPhatter responded and could also smell the
               odor of marijuana coming from the room at about 2113 hours. I
               asked McPhatter, on a scale from 1 to 10 with10 being the most
               sure, how sure he was that the odor was marijuana and he said 8
               to 8.5. I asked him, on a scale from 1 to 10, how sure he was
               that the odor was coming from room 1113, he said a 10. I asked
               McPhatter what his training and experience was in the
               recognition in the odor of marijuana. He said he has
               participated in two controlled burns of marijuana as part of
               his training to be a hall director at WSU; the most recent was
               within the last month with Corporal Daniels. McPhatter has made
               several reports of marijuana to the WSU Police department that
               have been confirmed. McPhatter told me the two people assigned
               to room 1113 Stephenson North were, Nathan T. Gordon (DOB
               07/07/97) and Taichak Chu (DOB 01/03/96). McPhatter did not
               know if either resident had a medical marijuana card and both
               are under 21 years of age. I wrote an affidavit for a search
               warrant and a search warrant and called Judge Douglas B
               Robinson. Judge Robinson granted the warrant (#SW082315B) at
               about 2233 hours. Officer Petlovany, Officer Westerman and I
               went to Stephenson North room 1113 to serve the warrant. I
               knocked at the door twice and announced we were the police and
               had a search warrant. A male later identified as Taichak Chu
               (010396) answered the door. Officer Petlovany detained and
               handcuffed Chu and Officer Westerman and I secured the room. I
               then read the Chu Miranda warnings and the search warrant at
               about 2251 hours. Chu said he understood his rights and would
               speak to us. He said his roommate Gordon and a friend were
               there earlier and then went to get food. I could smell a strong
               odor of marijuana coming from the room. I asked Chu if he had

               been smoking marijuana, he said he had not. He said Gordon and
               Gordon's friend were smoking before they left for dinner.
               Officer Petlovany and I searched the room. On the north side of
               the room which Chu said was Gordon's I found a water
               pipe("bong") with marijuana residue, a clear container with
               flakes of marijuana in it, and a grinder with marijuana flakes
               in it. I also seized two opened 12 oz cans of beer that were in
               the refrigerator on the north side of the room. There were also
               several empty beer cans in the room, and two empty alcohol
               bottles, all on the north side of the room. I seized a piece of
               paper from the north side of the room that had Gordon's name
               and Stephenson North room 1113 on a packing label. I asked Chu
               if he would call Gordon so I could talk to him. He said he
               would. I talked to Gordon and asked him to return to the room.
               He said he was at Cougar Country and it would take him a while
               to get back. I waited for awhile and called back. I asked
               Gordon if he had a medical marijuana card, he said he did not.
               I told Gordon I would be forwarding charges to the Whitman
               County Prosecutor for possession of marijuana and minor in
               possession of alcohol. I also told Gordon I would be forwarding
               my report to student conduct. I observed Officer Westerman
               dispose of the beer and beer cans in the Stephenson North 11th
               floor bathroom. I returned to the office with the rest of the
               evidence and placed it in an evidence locker. At 0530 hours I
               photographed and processed the evidence. I used a NIK test kit
               to test some of the green vegetable material in the plastic
               container, it tested presumptive positive for marijuana. There
               was not enough marijuana present to measure. I placed all
               evidence in locker 5 in the evidence room. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 24th day of August, 2015, in Pullman,
