               helping to move an individual into the dorm, but did not know
               which one or what the indivdiual's name was. When asked about
               entering any of the vehicles he told me the male had not
               entered any of the vehicles while he had been watching. I told
               Lloyd if they saw the male back in the parking lot to give me a
               call and I would come down and speak with him. Lloyd told me he
               would and I cleared a short time later. Nothing further at this

               Search warrant get on the ground", several times as the team
               entered through an open door on the building. As I entered the
               building I saw a male subject sitting in a recliner. The male
               subject began to lay on the ground. I went to him and stood
               with him until Ofc. Pratt (PPD) handcuffed him. The search
               warrant execution was completed without incident. Ofc. Boyd cut
               a lock on an out building. See PPD and WCSO report for complete
               details. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under

               the steam tunnel via a manhole cover near Streit Hall. Both
               males contacted and warned for trespassing and MIP Exhibiting.

               A. Krueger 08/12/96 Student Conduct Trespassing and MIP
               Exhibiting NARRATIVE: On 08/15/15 at approximately 2352 hours
               Cpl. Kuhrt and Ofc. Whitman were on foot near Streit Hall when
               Cpl. Kuhrt radioed that he just witnessed two males entering
               and exiting the steam tunnel entrance near Streit Hall. I was
               in a patrol car and responded to the area. Cpl. Kuhrt provided
               me with a description of the two and stated they were walking
               through the Streit Perhman turn around. As I reached the area
               of Streit Perham I saw the two that Cpl. Kuhrt had described
               and told them to stop. Ofc. Jones arrived on scene as well. I
               asked the two, later identified as Kenneth Michael Ficklin
               06/06/97 and Rory Allen Krueger 08/12/96, why I was contacting
               them. They stated they did not know. I asked them to think of
               the last five minutes and see if there was anything they did
               that would cause me to talk to them. Ficklin said something to
               the effect "that sewer drain?" About this time Cpl. Kuhrt and
               Ofc. Whitman arrived on scene. Since there were four Officers
               to the two subjects I Mirandized them both. Both stated they
               understood their rights and did not wish to talk to me. As the
               two responded to me I could smell the odor of intoxicants
               coming from them. Cpl. Kuhrt stated he witnessed Ficklin go
               into the steam tunnel but could not see Krueger. I told the two
               that they could be charged with criminal trespassing and MIP
               Exhibiting but as long as they had not been contacted before I
               would be sending this case to Student Conduct only. Both stated
               they had not been contacted before. I told the two that the
               best advice I could give them is not to do anything that would
               give me a reason to stop and talk to them. Ofc. Jones ran the
               two names and both came back clear with no prior contacts. I
               told the two that there were being referred to student conduct
               and told they were free to go. END OF REPORT I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of

               asked if they knew why I was there. They said they did not. I

               hours I was dispatched to Stephenson East room 1107 for the
               odor of marijuana. Ofc. Whitman and I responded. Upon arrival
               to the room I could smell the odor of marijuana coming from the
               room. I knocked on the door and a male subject identified by
               Cougar Card as Harley J. Coldiron, answered the door. I told
               Coldiron I could smell the odor of marijuana coming from his
               room. Coldiron said he smoked marijuana, but it wasn't in the
               room. I asked Coldiron how much more marijuana was in his room
               and he said none. He said if he gave me consent to search his
               room I would not find anything. I asked if I could do that and
               he stepped aside. I checked the room and located flecks of
               marijuana on his desk. Coldiron said that was where he rolled
               his joint. I located a bong in a sock. Coldiron said that it
               was his, but he broke the stem earlier in the day while he was
               walking around. Although Coldiron was cooperative I did not
               believe much of what he told me as he was very deceptive and
               lied. I told Coldiron that I would be forwarding the case to
               student conduct since he admitted to smoking marijuana and I
               found trace amounts of marijuana in his room. Nothing further.
