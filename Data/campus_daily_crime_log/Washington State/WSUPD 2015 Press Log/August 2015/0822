               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3625 SYNOPSIS: Report of dog running at
               large. The dog was caught and returned to a responsible.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               08/22/15 around 1127 hrs I was dispatched to a report of a dog
               running at large in the area of Bailey Brayton Field. Asst
               Chief Hansen also responded and shortly before my arrival
               Hansen told me he had the dog in his possession. As I contacted
               Hansen he had located a phone number for the owner of the dog
               and was calling him. Upon reaching him Hansen found out the dog
               lives at 1025 NE Duncan Ln, but the owner was currently unable
               to pick it up. He told Hansen he was currently in the Lentil
               parade and was unable to get away. Hansen determined a roommate
               was currently at home and I agreed to transport the dog. Upon
               my arrival at the address given I contacted Zachary R Nelson
               (05/09/95) who told me he had been looking for the dog after
               they had let him out to go to the bathroom. We spoke briefly
               about this before the dog was turned over to him and I cleared.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 22nd day of August, 2015, in

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3627 SYNOPSIS: Report of a female who
               had been sick. Subject was evaluated by Pullman Ambulance and
               was released after a responsible was contacted. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Torres-Sablan, Aleena M (01/24/99)
               Warned MIP 2. Hancock, Kaitlyn R (01/05/97) Contacted
               NARRATIVE: On 08/22/15 around 1152 hrs I was dispatched to a
               report of a female, later identified as Aleena M Torres-Sablan
               (01/24/99), who was believed to have been vomiting from alcohol
               consumption in room 732 of Rogers Hall. Asst Chief Hansen also
               responded and upon our arrival we contacted Torres-Sablan and
               her friend, later identified as Kaitlyn R Hancock (01/05/97),
               and told the following. Hancock explained her and Torres-Sablan
               had gone to a friends apartment earlier in the evening on
               08/21/15. During the time there Torres-Sablan had consumed what
               was described as 2 shots of hard alcohol. Hancock confirmed she
               had been with Torres-Sablan all night and after returning to
               her room around 0100 hrs they had not left again. Torres-Sablan
               confirmed this information and as she spoke I noticed a faint
               odor of intoxicants coming from her breath as she spoke. Hansen
               continued to speak with her and asking her basic questions
               which she was able to answer. After obtaining Torres-Sablan's
               information it was discovered she was 16 years of age. Her
               guardian's information was gathered and as I left to retrieve a
               cell phone to contact her guardian Pullman Ambulance arrived to
               evaluate her. I returned a short time later and after
               attempting to contact several family members I was finally able
               to reach Torres-Sablan's step mother, later identified as April
               A Sablan (04/20/79). Sablan, who lives in Guam and speaking
               with us by using facetime, told us it would be fine to release
               Torres-Sablan to Hancock's custody. Around this point Pullman
               Ambulance told us that would be fine and cleared a short time
               later. Hansen and I remained and spoke to both females for a
               short period of time longer before leaving. As we were leaving
               we were told Hancock's roommate had information which differed
               regarding this incident and we went to speak with her. We later
               learned Torres-Sablan had lied to us and had left around 0100
               against Hancocks wishes, only to return around 0730 hrs at
               which time she got sick. Upon learning this information we
               returned to speak with Torres-Sablan and Hancock. After being
               confronted regarding the issues raised both Hancock and Torres-
               Sablan admitted to having not being truthful with us. We
               discussed this issue and both individuals were warned regarding
               alcohol usage, and Torres-Sablan was warned on the effects her

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3638 08/22/15 SYNOPSIS: Two (2)
               residents stuck in Orton elevator #2. Pullman Fire extricated
               the occupants from the elevator. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On August 22, 2015 at about 2027
               hours I was dispatched to a report of two (2) people stuck
               inside Orton elevator #2. I responded to the building. The
               elevator was on floor one. The outer and inner doors were both
               open about six (6) inches. The outer doors would manually open.
               The inner doors were froze in place. The occupants said they
               entered the elevator and the doors closed and then partially
               opened. The control panel made a buzzing noise and then stopped
               working. I attempted to open the interior doors without
               success. I asked Whitcom to call Facilities Operations to have
               an Elevator Technician respond. About fifteen (15) minutes
               later a WSU Facilities Operations employee arrived on scene. He
               was not able to open the elevator. He called his dispatch and
               had the Elevator Technician called out. I was told it would be
               at least an hour response for the Elevator Technician. The
               occupants had been in the elevator for over 45 minutes at this
               point. I asked for Pullman Fire to respond. Pullman
               Firefighters were successful in extricating the occupant out of
               the elevator. They turned off the power which released the
               doors. There were no injuries. The occupants were out of the
               elevator at about 2148 hours. The Elevator Technician arrived
               after the occupants were released. Pullman Fire briefed the
               Elevator Technician on the status of the elevator. No further
               investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 23rd day of August, 2015, in
               Pullman, Washington. _______________________________________

               hours I was clearing a traffic when I saw a vehicle drive by
               me, southbound on Forest Way, with a headlight out. I pulled
               behind the vehicle and activated my emergency lights. The
               vehicle continued to drive for about 100 to 150 yards. I
               activated my siren and the vehicle pulled over. I approached
               the vehicle and the driver's side window was still closed. The

               proof of insurance. Doppa reacted slowly to my request, but did

               passenger were unable to find the registration for the vehicle.
               Doppa appeared dazed and looked at his passenger while she
               looked for the registration. I asked Doppa if he had any drinks
               tonight and he held up his fingers and gestured a small amount,
               as he said he had a "little bit". I asked Doppa if I could do a
               quick eye test with him and he said he would. I asked him to
               square his shoulders to me as much as he could. I told him to
               follow the top of my pen with his eyes only. I began the test
               and he moved his head to follow my pen. I told him to keep his
               head still and I began again. He moved his head again to follow
               my pen. I explained again that he needed to keep his head
               still. I began again and could see clues that he may have
               consumed alcohol. I returned to my vehicle and ran his name and
               said I would be testing. Doppa driver's license was clear.
               Officer Boyd arrived on scene as I returned to Doppa's vehicle.
               I asked Doppa if he would step out of the vehicle. As he exited
               the vehicle he lost his balance and placed his hand on the
               vehicle to brace himself. I asked Doppa to walk to a walkway
               near his vehicle that was a flat cement surface. He was wearing
               flip flop type sandals. I then asked Doppa if he would take
               some voluntary field sobriety test. He said he would. I asked
               if he had any physical impairments that would keep him from
               taking the test he said there was not. I asked if he wore
               glasses or contacts, he said he did not. I explained I would be
               evaluating him on how he performed the tests as well as how
               well he followed my instructions. I began the standardized

               field sobriety tests by asking him to stand with his feet
               together, hands at his side, and to stay in that position
               during the first test. The first test is the Horizontal Gaze
               Nystagmus test. I explained to Doppa that it was an eye test. I
               explained that during the test he needed to follow the tip of
               my pen with his eyes only, and not to move his head. Doppa said
               he understood. Doppa's pupils were equal and his eyes tracked
               equally. I could see a lack of smooth pursuit with both eyes,
               and a distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation.
               There was no vertical nystagmus present. During this test I
               also observed Doppa swaying approximately two to three inches.
               The next test I explained to Doppa was the walk and turn. I
               explained to Doppa to imagine a line straight out in front of
               him and to place his left foot on that line and then place his
               right foot in front of his left with his heel and toe touching.
               I told him, to keep his hands at his sides and to maintain that
               position while I explained the test and not to begin the test
               until I told him to do so. I explained to Doppa that he was to
               take nine heel to toe steps along the imaginary line. Then when
               he reached his ninth step to keep that foot planted and make a
               series of small steps to turn around and take nine heel to toe
               steps back along the same line. I demonstrated three steps and
               I also demonstrated the turn and then three return steps,
               explaining that he needed to take the full nine steps down and
               back. I told him that during the test he needed to keep his
               hands at his side, look at his feet while he was walking and
               count his steps out loud. I also told him that once he began
               the test he needed to continue until the test was complete. I
               asked Doppa if he had any questions. He said he did not. I told
               him to begin the test. Doppa began walking and had difficulty
               maintaining balance while getting into the starting position.
               Once Doppa began the test he did not touch heel to toe on any
               of his steps. He also stopped before doing the turn. Doppa
               began the turn correctly but then moved his left foot off of
               the line and then placed his right foot on the line to begin
               the return nine steps. The next test I explained was the one
               leg stand. I instructed Doppa to stand with his feet together,
               hands at his side, and to maintain that position while I
               explained the instructions. I also told him not to begin the
               test until I told him to do so. I asked if he understood he
               said he did. I explained that during this test he was to lift
               the foot of his choice so that his foot was six inches off the
               ground and parallel to the ground, with both legs straight.
               Then he was to count out loud by one thousands, and I
               demonstrated the stance and the counting "one thousand one, one
               thousand two, one thousand three". I explained that during the
               test he needed to keep his hands at his side, he needed to look
               at his foot and to count out loud as demonstrated. I asked if
               he had any questions, he said he did not. I asked him which
               foot he was going to raise, he said he was going to raise his
               left foot. Doppa raised his left foot and began the test. On
               the count of one he put his foot back down and kept trying to
               raise it until his count of three one thousand. During the test
               Doppa looked at me the whole time not down at his foot. He also
               swayed back and forth about two to three inches. Doppa counted

               to 21 one thousand in about 30 seconds. I asked Doppa to
               provide a voluntary breath sample for the PBT. I told him this
               would not replace the evidentiary breath test and stated it was
               voluntary just like the other test. He provided the sample to
               my ALCO Sensor FST (SN#102461) and it recorded a reading of
               .106. I performed the PBT in accordance with state toxicologist
               recommendations and I have been trained in using the ALCO
               Sensor FST PBT. I placed Doppa under arrest for DUI, placed him
               in handcuffs (DL), and told him he was being audio and video
               recorded. I read him Miranda warnings from my department issued
               Miranda warnings card. He said he understood his rights. I put
               Doppa into the back of my patrol car. Officer Boyd remained on
               scene to wait for the tow and I transported Doppa to Pullman
               Police Department for the BAC. I arrived at Pullman PD and
               began the BAC with Doppa. I read Doppa his constitutional
               rights. Doppa said he understood his rights and chose to speak
               to an attorney. I called public defender Steve Martonick and
               handed the phone to Doppa. I left the room and observed Doppa
               from outside of the room. I read Doppa the implied consent
               warnings and he signed that he had them read to him at 0041
               hours. I asked Doppa if he would submit to a breath test. He
               said he would submit to a breath test. I checked Doppa's mouth
               at 0042 hours and found no foreign substances. Doppa had
               difficult providing enough of a breath the Draeger instrument,
               which caused several incomplete test. He informed me that two
               to three years ago he had bell's palsy which left him with a
               weakness in his lips. I believe this weakness in his lips
               caused him to not be able to make a proper seal on the breath
               tube. Doppa was able to provided a breath sample and the
               results of the sample were .114/.113 at 0119 hours, and a
               sample of .114/.113 at 0123 hours. The breath sample was
               administered in accordance to the methods approved by the
               Washington State Toxicologist pursuant to the Washington
               Administrative Code. Doppa was fingerprinted and photographed.
               I provided Doppa with the Driver's Hearing Request form, the
               Notice of Hearing/Conditions of Release form, a copy of the
               Breath Test Document, and the Tow/Impound form. I issued Doppa
               criminal citation 5Z0223821 and informed him he was being cited
               for DUI. I gave him a copy and released Doppa from custody. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 23rd day of August, 2015, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer
