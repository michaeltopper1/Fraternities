               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 08-31-15 at
               about 1328 hours I was dispatched to the report of a theft from
               Todd Hall. Whitcom advised that the RP, Charleston R. White,
               was in the lobby for contact. I contacted White at WSUPD and
               asked him what happened. He said that on Friday, 08-28-15, he
               left his iPad Air in Todd room 216 after his class got out at
               noon. He said that as soon as he realized he left it there he
               returned and found it was stolen. I was advised by our evidence
               custodian that it had not been turned in to WSUPD and that the
               Todd Hall lost and found did not have it. I asked White to
               describe the iPad and he said it was black with "Washington
               State Athletics" engraved on the back. He said it was in a
               black case with a built in keyboard. White said that he waited
               until today to report the theft because he had to leave for
               football on Friday afternoon and did not have time to report
               the incident. He said that today he notified one of his coaches
               and they told him to get a police case number, report the
               theft, and they would give him a new iPad. I asked White if the
               iPad belonged to him or Athletics. He said he was the owner. He
               told me that all the players got an iPad. He said it was his to
               keep and there was no expectation for him to return it at the
               end of the season or school year. The iPad and case is valued
               at $500.00. White did not know the serial number or any other
               identifying information about the iPad. There are no suspects
               or leads. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 31st day of August, 2015, in Pullman,

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3856 SYNOPSIS: The WSU Graduate School
               Office received 2 prank calls from an unidentifiable "Private"
               phone number. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 08-31-15, Alexandra R. Germer was working in the
               WSU Graduate School Office as an Office Assistant. At
               approximately 1440 hours, she received a phone call from an
               unidentified male. When Germer answered the telephone, she said
               "Graduate School, this is Alex". The male immediately stared
               talking and said "Alex,you cunt, you have a smelly twaut, I can
               smell you from here. You must eat a lot of tuna. Do you?" The
               male then hung up. Approximately 5 minutes later, the male
               called back again and Alex answered the telephone in the same
               way. The male said "fuck you, you stupid whore" The male
               continued speaking and Alex hung up the telephone. The male did
               not call back. Alex said she did not recognize the male voice
               as somebody she would know and didn't think it was a student
               who was angry with the Department. She believed it was just
               someone with "Nothing better to do". Alex said the phone calls
               came into the Department on a "Private" telephone line. She had
               her Information Technology Department look into the phone calls
               to see if the telephone number could somehow be traced and they
               told her the line could not be traced. Since there are no
               suspects or leads, I recommend the case be closed as
               "Information Only" at this time. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Boyd/335 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3858 SYNOPSIS: Subject reported
               receiving a threatening voice mail. The suspect was identified
               and a message left for him to discontinue the threatening
               calls. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Kevin F. Sheedy
               Warned Harassment 2. NARRATIVE: On 08/31/15 at about 1620 hrs
               Dispatch advised of a subject requesting contact regarding a
               threatening voice mail he received. I contacted the
               complainant, David J. Leonard (062773), who told me he received
               a profanity laced voice mail in which the suspect said "David
               you fucking cock sucking piece of shit your fucking schools a
               fucking piece of cock sucking bag of shit, illegal alien, male,
               female, girl, boy, what the fuck are you gonna do about it you
               pussy I'd love to have you in front of me I'd take your fucking
               head off." Leonard was not concerned the subject was going to
               actually act on the threat but with the high number of threats
               his department has been receiving due to a recent Fox News
               report involving them he wanted the incident documented. Later
               I was informed that Officer Stewart took a complaint from the
               front office staff at WSU PD regarding several threatening
               phone calls received by front office staff and the Chief of
               Police. See case #15-W3959 for further regarding that incident.
               Officer Stewart was able to determine the suspect was Kevin F.
               Sheedy based on a reverse look up of the phone number. The
               phone number in his case and the one that left the message for
               Leonard was the same. I played the voice mail Leonard forwarded
               to me and Officer Stewart identified the voice as the same one
               that called the front office and Chief. I called the number but
               no one answered. The voice mail recording was changed from the
               time Officer Stewart heard it and now identified the number as
               belonging to "David Leonard" but the voice was still Sheedy's.
               I left a message for Sheedy explaining that we were able to
               identify him as the suspect in both cases and told him he
               should re-think the way he was responding to the news report
               and discontinue his threatening calls. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 31 day of August, 2015, in Pullman,

               Sheedy Suspect 2. NARRATIVE: On 083115 at approximately 1620
               hours, WSU Police Records advised that they were receiving
               multiple harassing phone calls. Chief Gardner advised he spoke
               with the subject and the subject told Gardner he was going to
               beat him to death and other obscene statements. WSU Records
               specialist Deann Anderson stated the subject used multiple
               obscene statements toward her and threatened to rape her. This
               caller has been identified as being the same one calling
               multiple departments on WSU Campus with similar statements and
               threats. I contacted John DAleo with the WSU IT phones system.
               DAleo stated he was able to identify the phone number calling
               as 619-241-5547. I checked www.phonedetective.com and
               determined that the person registered to the phone number is
               Kevin F Sheedy from San Diego California. I attempted to call
               the phone number and received a voicemail stating, "You have
               reached Barak Obama etc." Chief Gardner listened to the
               voicemail and determined that the voice sounded the same as the
               original caller who threatened him. Chief Gardner left a
               message. I later called the number again and the voicemail had
               changed to say, "This is David Leonard etc." I talked with Ofc.
               Boyd who had just taken a similar case from David Leonard. Ofc.
               Boyd called the phone number for Sheedy again and left a
               message for him to call back. I attempted to contact San Diego
               Police Department non-emergency number and the phone rang for
               over 20 minutes. I hung up the phone due to their high volume
               of calls. Attach to case 15-W3836 I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 31st day of

               was dispatched to a drugs call at Chief Joseph apartments,
               building E. A resident of another apartment was reporting a
               strong odor of marijuana coming from apartment E12. Officer
               Boyd and I responded and talked to the complainant. She said
               she could smell a strong odor of marijuana in the stairwell and
               she believed it was coming from apartment E12. Officer Boyd and
               I stepped into the stairwell and could smell an odor of
               marijuana. We approached apartment E12 and Officer Boyd could
               smell an odor of marijuana coming from the door jam of E12. I
               knocked on the door and a female, later identified as
               Charamaine M. Madden (021196), answered the door. As she opened
               the door I could smell a strong odor of marijuana. I told her
               we were there because someone reported the odor of marijuana
               and I asked if there was any marijuana in the apartment. She
               said there was not. I also asked if she was 21 and she said she
               was not. Madden said two people had come over that had been
               smoking marijuana and attempted to smoke marijuana in the
               apartment. She said she told them not to and asked them to
               leave. Officer Boyd recalled seeing to males near the building
               as we arrived which may have been the people Madden was talking
               about. I asked Madden if I could search the apartment for
               marijuana and she refused. I warned Madden that she could not
               possess or consume marijuana on WSU property. I also told her
               it was a good idea to continue to deny access to her apartment
               to those possessing or consuming marijuana. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 1st day of September, 2015, in Pullman,
