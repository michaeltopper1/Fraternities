    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Edwards/330 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3836 SYNOPSIS: Report of harassing
               online messages. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 08-30-15 at about 1335 hours I was contacted by
               PPD Sergeant Hargraves. Hargraves advised that he had taken a
               report of a harassment but discovered that it was occurring on
               campus. Hargraves told me that Selena Lesterbreikss was
               reporting that there was harassing messages online about her
               after a story aired on Fox & Friends regarding the syllabus she
               has for her class, "Women & Popular Culture". Hargraves advised
               that Selena was very upset by what was going on and that he had
               spoke to her husband, Steven Breikss, about the messages.
               Hargraves told me that he has not seen any of the messages and
               does not know the content of them at this time. He said he
               spoke with Steven about me contacting him and he agreed.
               Hargraves provided me with Steven's phone number. I called
               Steven and asked what was going on. He told me that last night
               a story aired on Fox & Friends with the title "Professors
               threaten bad grades for saying "illegal alien", "male" and
               "female". He stated that his wife, Selena, was mentioned in
               this story and now she is receiving harassing, possibly
               threatening, email messages to her WSU email account as well as
               on an online forum. I asked Steven if I could speak to Selena
               and he handed her the phone. I asked Selena what was going on
               and she said that "Campus Reform" got ahold of the syllabus she
               has for her "Women & Popular Culture" class. She told me that
               in her syllabus she wrote that "students could risk a failing
               grade if they use any common descriptors that are considered
               oppressive and hateful language". She gave examples such as
               using the terms "male and female rather than men and women".
               The punishment for repeatedly using these banned words
               "includes, but is not limited to, removal from class without
               attendance or participation points, failure of the assignment,
               and - in extreme cases - failure for the semester". Selena told
               me that she started receiving "hate mail" soon after the story
               aired, sometime around 6pm (on 08-29-15). Selena told me that
               she knew something was going to air because Fox & Friends had
               attempted contact with her, but she did not respond. She said
               that as a preemptive move, she shut down her Facebook page and
               all other social media sites. She said the only messages she is
               receiving are going to her work email address and are on forum
               type websites, like 4chan.org. I asked Selena if she felt
               afraid or threatened by any of the messages. She said that she
               hasn't actually looked at any of them because she was afraid

               to. She told me that her husband has been monitoring the
               internet her email account and reading some of the messages to
               her. She said she was "kind of" afraid. I asked her what she
               meant by that and she said that she was afraid to come onto
               campus. I asked if any of the messages contained a direct
               threat to harm her or her family and she said no, not yet. I
               then spoke with Selena about her schedule on campus. She told
               me that she teaches "Women & Popular Culture" on
               Tuesdays/Thursdays from 12:00 to 1:15 in CUE 219. She said her
               office hours are Tuesday/Thursday from 2pm-4pm in Wilson-Short
               Hall room 10. Selena also told me that she takes two classes as
               a student that are on Monday/Wednesday from 1pm-4:30pm in CUE
               218. I spoke with Selena about her safety on campus. I told her
               that I would send an email to all of the officers advising them
               of the situation and I also told Selena that an officer could
               walk around the areas she is supposed to be. I told her that we
               could, absent any emergent circumstances, have an officer walk
               around in the CUE before her class starts at 12 on
               Tuesday/Thursday. She was relieved by this and asked if it was
               really possible. I told her it was. I also told Selena (and
               Steven) to call 911 if at any point they feel they are in
               danger or if they see anything suspicious. They said they
               would. She also told me that she was going to work with her
               supervisor on a safety plan for her. I then spoke to Steven
               again. I asked him to forward all of the emails and 4chan.org
               forum to me. I provided him with my email address. I asked
               Steven to continue to forward any emails that are received
               regarding this issue. He said he would and I ended my call. I
               received the emails and forum from Selena's email address. I
               added a copy of each email to this case as well as a copy of
               the 4chan.org discussion forum. There are no direct threats of
               harm in any of the information I saw. No crimes have occurred
               at this point. Investigation is ongoing. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               30th day of August, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 083015 at approximately 1715
               hours, I was dispatched to a report of malicious mischief in
               the Chinook Apartment parking lot outside the C building. Upon
               arrival, I contacted Tyler P. Walker who told me the following.
               On 082915 at approximately 2100 hours, he parked his 1999
               Saturn in the parking lot near the dumpster. On 083015 at
               approximately 1700 hours, he told me he returned to his vehicle
               and noticed someone spray painted light blue paint on his
               driver's side front and rear wheels and on the passenger side
               rear wheel. He told me that someone also spray painted the
               ground behind his car and the dumpster he was parked next to. I
               asked him if he had any idea who may have caused the damage to
               his car. He told me he thought the owner of a motorcycle parked
               in the same stall in front of his car may have done it. I asked
               him why, and he told me he thought the owner of the motorcycle
               also had a car they had been parking in that stall. I asked if
               he had any problems with the people in the past, and he told me
               he hadn't. I had dispatch run the plate and attach it to the
               case. Dispatch advised there was no local involvements for the
               motorcycle. I checked the damage to Walker's vehicle and
               noticed there was light blue spray paint on the three wheels. I
               also noticed "Swag" was written in blue spray paint on the
               dumpster and "wrong" was written on the ground. I took pictures
               of the damage to the vehicle, dumpster, and ground. I noted
               that the parking pass on the motorcycle was M0295. I estimated
               the damage to his vehicle at approximately $75 and $25 for the
               dumpster, and $25 for the paint on the pavement. Investigation
               continues. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under

               why he thought we were looking for him and he said someone told
               him an officer was looking for him the previous night. I asked
               the subject who he was and he said Justin (Justin D. Lam Po
               Tang 10/22/95). I asked Justin where he lived and he said room
               235. I asked Justin if he owned a ski mask and he said he did.
               I asked Justin where it was and he said at home. I asked Justin
               if he had a ski mask in his room and he said no. I asked Justin
               if I could search his room and he said I could. I went into
               Justin's room and searched it, but did not locate a ski mask. I
               located throwing knives, 2 pocket knives, and two throwing
               darts. At this point I had no reason to believe Justin was
               wandering the halls wearing a ski mask. Ofc. Boyd and I cleared
               and walked down to the lobby. I asked Whitcom to have the
               reporting parties meet me in the lobby. The on call RA (not
               identified) and the on call RED (Tiffany J. Firestone 09/05/91)
               arrived at the lobby. I asked Firestone what information she
               had. Firestone said she was called by the on call RA who
               reported receiving a text message from a student reporting that
               they saw a subject wearing a ski mask on the second floor. I
               asked the RA to gather anyone that has information about the
               subject wearing a ski mask and have them come to the lobby.
               Approximately 5 minutes later 9 subjects arrived in the lobby
               and sat down. I explained to them that I wanted to find out
               more information. I asked each person individually what they
               SAW first hand either tonight (08/30/15) or Friday
               night/Saturday morning (08/29/15). -Molly B. Champ-Gibson (CCD
               286) on 08/29/15 saw a male subject wearing all black and
               wearing a ski mask walk past the lounge on the 2nd floor. -
               Natalie J. Vance (CCD 286) on 08/29/15 was walking with a group
               of people and saw a person wearing all black and a ski mask
               walk by them. After her friend (Meyer) attempted to pull off
               the ski mask the subject flipped open a knife and walked away
               from the group. I asked if the subject said anything to them
               and she said no. I asked if the subject walked towards the
               group with the knife open and she said no. I asked how big the

               knife was and she showed an approximate size of 8-10 inches -
               Stacy A. Meyer (CCD 275) on 08/29/15 was walking with a group
               of friends. Meyer said she saw a subject wearing all black and
               a ski mask walking by her group. Meyer said she thought it was
               creepy that he was wearing a ski mask so she decided to try and
               pull it off. I asked Meyer if she saw the knife and she said
               no. -Alexander J. Hollenbaugh (CCD 217) on 08/29/15 he was
               walking with Meyer, Vance and some other friends on the 2nd
               floor of CCD. Hollenbaugh said he saw a male subject wearing
               all black and a ski mask walk by his group. Hollenbaugh said
               that after Meyer attempted to remove the ski mask, the subject
               flipped open a knife and walked away from the group.
               Hollenbaugh said the subject closed the knife and then opened
               it again. Hollenbaugh said the subject was Asian. I asked
               Hollenbaugh how he knew that. Hollenbaugh said the subject was
               short, had darker skin, and "you could tell by his eyes". I
               asked everyone present (there were 5 other subjects not
               identified because they did not see anything first hand) if
               they knew that Justin from the 2nd floor was the person walking
               around wearing the ski mask. Each person individually said no.
               Several people voiced their concerns how he was creepy because
               of the things posted on his door and because he listened to
               "heavy metal" music. I tried to explain to the group that we
               should all stop focusing on Justin as the suspect. I told them
               that their issue was still important to the police, but I did
               not want to single out Justin and turn the situation into a
               witch hunt. I told the group the police would increase their
               presence in the hall. I explained to the group to continue to
               be vigilant and be good witnesses if anything else were to
               happen and encouraged them to call 911 in the future if they
               are concerned. I asked if there was anything else the police
               department could do to make them feel safe. One of the subjects
               asked about campus notifications. I explained the Everbridge
               system and said the police department can look into that
               further for any similar occurrence in the future. Hall staff
               offered relocation to anyone that did not feel safe, but no one
               was interested in that option. I clarified with the group that
               no one saw a person wearing a ski mask tonight. I thanked the
               group for their time and we cleared. I spoke with the hall
               staff and it sounded like there was fourth hand information via
               social media that the person was walking around tonight wearing
               a ski mask. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 31st day of August, 2015, in
               Pullman, Washington. _______________________________________
