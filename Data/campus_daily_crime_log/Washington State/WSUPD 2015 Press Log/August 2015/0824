               at approximately 2120 hours I was dispatched to a drugs call at

               07/16/88, who stated RA's who were doing rounds could smell the
               odor of marijuana coming from room 486. I walked to room 486
               but could not smell the odor of marijuana coming from the room.
               I knocked on the door and two people answered. The two females
               in the room were Rachel A. Zylstra 12/16/96 and Gabriela E.
               Melio 10/30/92. I explained why I had been called to the room
               and both had a genuine expression of surprise. I was eagerly
               invited into the room to see that they had nothing illegal.
               Once inside the room I again was unable to smell any marijuana
               an saw no signs of marijuana usage. I thanked the two for their
               time and apologized for the inconvenience. This case can be
               closed as unfounded since there was no evidence of marijuana.

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: BRW/325 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3676 SYNOPSIS: Subject issued an
               infraction for urinating in public. Subject is not a WSU
               student. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Kyle A. Bentz
               06/14/93 Cited UIP 5Z0872230 2. NARRATIVE: On 08/24/15 at
               approximately 2219 hours, I had just pulled into the Green
               parking lot just northwest of 755 NE Campus Street when I
               noticed a male standing between two parked cars. The male was
               facing a bush and both of his hands were near his crotch area.
               Believing that the male was urinating in public I exited my car
               and walked up to him. As I neared the male, later identified as
               Kyle Andrew Bentz 06/14/93, trying to zip up his pants. There
               was a large wet spot in the dirt where Bentz had been facing.
               The surrounding area was dry and it was clear that the only way
               Bentz was able to make that large puddle of liquid was to
               urinate. Bentz turned around and I told him that we needed to
               talk. To prevent Bentz from attempting to flee I grabbed ahold
               of his shirt sleeve. Bentz and I walked to my patrol car a few
               feet away and I told Bentz to stand in front of the car. I
               asked Bentz why he was urinating in public and Bentz replied,
               "was I?" I told Bentz what I had witnessed and Bentz said he
               wanted to speak to his lawyer. I told Bentz that he was being
               detained and not under arrest. I handcuffed Bentz and placed
               him in the backseat of my patrol car so I could complete his
               citation. I filled out a Sector Citation for Pullman City Code
               5.50.010 Public Urination/Defecation. I explained the citation
               to Bentz and provided him with his copy. Bentz was told he was
               free to go and I cleared. END OF REPORT I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3678 SYNOPSIS: Forwarding charges on
               Andrew F. Guscott (042297) for MIP-Exhibiting. Refer to Student
               Conduct as well. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Andrew
               F. Guscott (042297) Forward/Conduct MIP 2. NARRATIVE: On 082415
               at approximately 2220 hours I was backing up Ofc. Westerman in
               the green lot next to the President's Residence. Across the
               street I heard something fall. I looked up and I saw Andrew F.
               Guscott (042297) staggering to get up and falling into the
               nearby retaining wall. I gained his feet, swaying heavily, and
               staggered in a run across the street to the President's
               Residence. I then saw a male come running from the direction of
               Delta Tau Delta to catch up to Guscott. This person was later
               identified as Bennett M. Dammeier (031096). Ofc. Westerman said
               he was okay so I got in my vehicle and caught up to the pair at
               NE Campus and NE Spokane St. Dammeier was helping Guscott walk.
               I approached the two on foot and they both appeared to be under
               the age of 21. I could smell a strong odor of alcohol coming
               off of Guscott's breath. He had bloodshot and watery eyes.
               Guscott had difficulty standing and his pants zipper was
               undone. Dammeier said he was just trying to get Guscott home
               safe. He did not really know him. Dammeier had been working the
               door at Delta Tau Delta and saw him going across the street.
               Guscott gave me his name and the date of birth of 092297,
               repeatedly, and confirmed he was 17. Dispatch was not able to
               immediately find him but eventually found him with a birth date
               of 042297 making him 18. Dammeier had left to find someone who
               knew Guscott better so we could identify him. I checked
               Guscott's eyes and observed a lack of smooth pursuit in both
               eyes. I was unable to get his eyes to maximum deviation as he
               would stop watching my pen. I asked if would provide a breath
               sample for my PBT and he said he wanted to wait until Dammeier
               returned. I told him I did not know if his friend would return.
               I believe he mumbled that he did not want to at that time.
               Samuel S. Cook (061594) arrived with another unidentified male.
               I explained to them that I was going to forward charges of MIP
               on Guscott regardless of what happened going forward, but I
               told them he had wanted their input regarding giving a breath
               sample. I told them I wanted to get a breath sample to make
               sure he was safe. I checked with Guscott and he said he would
               give a sample if Cook said so. I attempted twice to get samples
               from him but he barely blew. Ofc. Westerman, who had arrived as
               backup, used his PBT as mine had gone into error for
               insufficient flow. Guscott provided a sample of .208 with a

               very small sample. I reiterated to Guscott that I would be
               forwarding charges of MIP-Exhibiting to the prosecutor. Cook
               agreed to stay with Guscott the rest of the night. I told them
               they were free to go but I would give them a ride to Olympia
               Hall and make sure they get into the residence hall. I
               transported them there without incident. I cleared. Nothing

               Exhibiting 2. NARRATIVE: On 08/25/15 at approximately 0040
               hours I was traveling east on NE Cougar Way near the Soccer
               Fields. As I passed the entrance to the driveway leading to
               Scott-Coman I noticed two females walking north in the
               driveway. They caught my attention because they were walking
               with their arms around each others shoulders and one of them
               was having a very hard time walking. The one female was
               staggering so much that she was pulling the other female around
               with her. I turned around and drove up behind them. I passed by
               them and noticed the female having a difficult time walking
               looked under the age of 21. I exited my patrol car and
               activated my VieVu camera. I asked the female where she was
               stumbling to and she said to her dorm. I told the female that I
               assumed she had too much to drink by the way she was stumbling
               and she said yes and that she was just trying to get to her
               dorm. While she was standing and talking to me she was severely
               swaying in a circular motion and her words were slurred. Due to
               the fact she was swaying so much I had her stand against my
               car. I asked the female for her name and date of birth and she
               provided me with Nikia N. Fawtoush 12/15/96. While Nikia spoke
               I could smell a strong odor of intoxicants coming from her
               breath. Around this time Ofc. Westerman arrived on scene. I
               asked Nikia how much she had to drink and she could not give me
               an intelligible answer. I ran Nikia's information through
               Whitcom and they radioed that there was no record found. I
               again asked Nikia for her name and she now provided me with
               Nikia R. Newton 12/15/96. The more Nikia spoke the less I
               understood her because of her slurred speech and because her
               answers were less understandable. Ofc. Westerman administered a
               PBT (FST #16805) with a result of .207. I explained to Nikia
               that I would be forwarding charges to the prosecutor's office.
               I asked the other unidentified female if she would take care of
               Nikia for the night and she said she would. I told the ladies
               they were free to go and they slowly sauntered off towards
               Regents Hall. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 25th day of August, 2015, in

               Vincent (061397) Forward/Conduct MIP-Exhibiting 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 082515 at approximately 0047 hours I was clearing a medical
               call at Stephenson North and driving up to Rogers when the
               ambulance in front of me stopped. I looked and noticed several
               people unloading from a vehicle. One of the individuals, Nice
               D. Vincent (061397), had sprawled themselves across the grass.
               Several people assisted in getting Vincent off the ground and
               began walking her north. As I approached the group I could
               smell the odor of intoxicants and when Vincent faced me she
               appeared to be under the age of 21. Vincent staggered and
               needed assistance to walk. I told Vincent I need to speak with
               her and she declined and kept walking. I told her she needed to
               stop and her friend pled with her to stop and she did by
               falling to the ground over sprinkler access panels. Vincent was
               emotional, had watery, and bloodshot eyes. I signaled to the
               medics to standby before they left. I got Vincent's information
               and her roommate's, Nicole Gallardo (121696). As we were doing
               so the sprinklers came on. Vincent was incapable of getting up
               and stayed in the sprinklers until the medics were able to lift
               her up and take her to the steps. It took long enough to move
               her that my clothes got soaked through. The medics cleared and
               I checked Vincent's eyes. I observed a lack of smooth pursuit
               in both eyes. I was not able to observe distinct and sustained
               nystagmus as she would stop tracking my pen. She swayed while
               standing and I could smell the odor of intoxicants on her
               breath. When asked what she drank, she would reply that a guy
               gave her a drink. Her friend stated it was vodka. Vincent
               declined to provide a breath sample for my PBT. I informed her
               I would be forwarding charges of MIP-Exhibiting. I told her she
               was free to go. Vincent needed to use the restroom so I
               assisted her and Gallardo in getting into Rogers to use the 1st
               floor restroom. Once done, I escorted them out and they walked
               to Goldsworthy Hall. I cleared. Nothing follows. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of

               NARRATIVE: On 08/25/15 at approximately 0045 hours I was
               traveling south on SE Spokane St. The defendant's vehicle was
               traveling in the same direction, but was approximately 50-80
               yards in front of my vehicle. It appeared the vehicle was
               traveling over the posted 20 MPH speed limit. I stopped my
               patrol car (Veh 7) and activated the front radar. The radar
               displayed a speed reading of 27MPH. There were no other moving
               vehicles in the radar field. As I was catching up to the
               vehicle I noticed it abruptly stopped at the intersection of SE
               Spokane and SE College Ave. The vehicle then turned left
               without activating the left turn signal. I caught up to the
               vehicle as it was turning right onto SE Idaho St. I activated
               my emergency lights. While the vehicle was stopping there was a
               group of approximately 5-6 subjects standing on the corner of
               Idaho and College. I activated my VieVu camera and approached
               the vehicle. As I was approaching the other group began to
               slowly walk by the vehicle. It appeared to me that the two
               groups might have known each other. I contacted the driver and
               told her the reason for the stop and that the stop was being
               recorded. I saw three other passengers in the vehicle. I asked
               the driver for her license, registration, and proof of
               insurance, which she provided. The driver was identified by
               WADL as Paige E. Calcagni 09/29/95. While standing at the
               vehicle I could smell the odor of burning marijuana. I asked
               Calcagni if anyone in the vehicle was over the age of 21 and
               all occupants said no. I asked if anyone had a medical
               marijuana card and everyone said no. I asked Calcagni to exit
               the vehicle and talk to me at the back of her car, which she
               did. I explained to Calcagni that I could smell the odor of
               marijuana coming from the car. Calcagni seemed surprised and
               said she picked up other people from a party. While Calcagni
               was speaking to me I could smell the odor of intoxicants on her
               breath. I asked Calcagni how much she had to drink and she said
               she did not have anything to drink. I asked Calcagni if I could
               check her eyes and she said yes. I checked Calcagni's eyes for
               a lack of smooth pursuit and saw it present in both eyes. I
               told Calcagni that she was not being honest with me. I asked
               Calcagni if she provided a breath sample if it would be all
               zeros and she said it would. Calcagni then said she had a beer.
               Sgt. Griffin arrived on scene around this time. I asked

               Calcagni if she would provide a breath sample and she said she
               would. I told Calcagni the PBT did not replace the evidentiary
               breath test and it was voluntary. I checked the PBT (FST #
               62324) and found it in proper working condition. Calcagni
               provided a breath sample of .102. I asked Calcagni if she would
               do some field sobriety tests to see if she was impaired by the
               alcohol she consumed. Calcagni did not give a straight answer.
               I explained to Calcagni that the tests were voluntary and it
               was up to her. Calcagni still did not give me an answer. I told
               Calcagni that regardless of her decision to do the tests, I
               would be arresting her. Calcagni said she would do the tests. I
               had Calcagni stand on the sidewalk on the west side of the
               roadway. I explained to Calcagni that she was not presently
               under arrest, but I still wanted to read her her rights. I read
               Calcagni her Miranda Rights which she said she understood. I
               administered the field sobriety tests on the paved and level
               sidewalk. The weather was clear with an approximate temperature
               of 65 degrees. Calcagni was wearing a skirt, a crop top, and
               flip flops during the tests. Lighting was provided by overhead
               lights and my flashlight. I explained to Calcagni that I would
               be evaluating her on how well she performed the tests and how
               well she followed instructions. I told Calcagni not to begin
               any test until I told her to do so. The first test I
               administered was the HGN. I told Calcagni to follow the tip of
               my pen with her eyes only with out moving her head. I held my
               pen approximately 12-15 inches in front of Calcagni's face and
               administered the test. I checked Calcagni's eyes and noticed
               they tracked equally and her pupils were equal in size. I did
               not see resting nystagmus in either eye. I saw a lack of smooth
               pursuit in both eyes and a distinct and sustained nystagmus at
               maximum deviation in both eyes. I saw an onset of nystagmus at
               approximately 40 degrees in both eyes. I noticed Calcagni
               swayed in a circular motion during the test. The next test I
               administered was the walk and turn. I told Calcagni to find an
               imaginary straight line and put her left foot on the line. I
               told Calcagni to put her right foot in front of her left foot
               touching heel to toe and leave her arms down at her sides. I
               told Calcagni to stay in that position while I explained the
               test. I told Calcagni that when I tell her to begin, to take
               nine steps touching heel to toe, watching her feet as she
               walked and count each step out loud. I told Calcagni that when
               she gets to step nine, to leave her lead foot in place and
               using her rear foot, take small steps around until facing the
               way she came. I told Calcagni to take nine steps back touching
               heel to toe and counting each step out loud. I told Calcagni
               that once she started, do not stop. I reminded Calcagni to
               count each step out loud, keep her arms at her sides, and watch
               her feet as she walked. I demonstrated the test and asked
               Calcagni if she understood and she said yes. I told Calcagni to
               begin at any time. Instruction Phase: Calcagni swayed left to
               right while I explained the test and before she began the test
               she lost her balance. Calcagni had to move her front foot to
               the left out of the starting position to regain her balance.
               First Nine Steps: Calcagni began the test and missed heel to
               toe between every step. Calcagni missed heel to toe from 1 to 3

               inches. Calcagni took a total of 10 steps. Calcagni performed
               an improper turn by taking steps with both of her feet. Return
               Nine Steps: Calcagni began her return steps and missed heel to
               toe between steps 2 & 3, 5 & 6, 7 & 8, and 8 & 9. The next test
               I administered was the one leg stand. I told Calcagni to stand
               with her feet together and her arms down at her sides. I told
               Calcagni that when I tell her to begin to raise the foot of her
               choice approximately 6 inches off the ground. I told Calcagni
               to point her toe forward, look at her foot, and count out loud
               by 1000's until I tell her to stop. I asked Calcagni if she
               understood, and she said yes. I told Calcagni to begin at any
               time. Calcagni raised her left foot and began the test.
               Calcagni swayed left to right during the test and counted 1014,
               1015, 1014, 1015, 1016. Calcagni put her foot down on his count
               of 1016. Thirty seconds elapsed on Calcagni's count of 1021. At
               this time it was my opinion that Calcagni's ability to drive
               was impaired by alcohol. I told Calcagni she was under arrest
               for DUI. I handcuffed (D/L) Calcagni and advised her of her
               right to counsel. I reminded Calcagni she was being audio and
               video recorded. I placed Calcagni in the backseat of my patrol
               car. I returned to Calcagni's vehicle and told her passengers
               that she was arrested for DUI. I explained that the car would
               be towed and they should gather their items and leave. While
               standing at the car I could not smell the odor of marijuana. I
               did not know if the odor was coming from the vehicle or the
               subjects nearby. Sgt. Griffin remained on scene and facilitated
               the tow with Autobody Supercenter. I transported Calcagni to
               Pullman PD for the BAC. Upon arrival Calcagni made a comment
               that her boyfriend would "beat the shit out of her for this".
               At the time I didn't know if she was being serious so I
               intended to re-visit it later. I checked the Draeger and found
               it working properly with the mouth tube warm to the touch. I
               read Calcagni her Constitutional Rights at 0110 hours. Calcagni
               said she understood her rights and signed both signature
               blocks. I checked Calcagni's mouth at 0110 hours, finding no
               foreign substance. I read Calcagni her Implied Consent Warnings
               for breath at 0113 hours. Calcagni signed that it was read to
               her. I asked Calcagni if she would submit to a breath test.
               Calcagni checked the "yes" box and initialed next to it. I
               asked Calcagni if she understood the warnings and she said she
               did. Sometime during the DUI process Calcagni asked me if I
               could provide her with resources for domestic violence.
               Calcagni provided a breath sample of .108(IR)/.108(EC) at 0130
               hours and a sample of .105(IR)/.104(EC) at 0134 hours. The
               breath test was administered in accordance to the methods
               approved by the Washington State Toxicologist pursuant to the
               Washington Administrative Code. I provided Calcagni with a copy
               of the following documents: Driver's Hearing Request, Notice of
               Hearing/Conditions of Release, and the Breath Test Document. I
               issued Calcagni a criminal citation for DUI. I explained the
               citation to Calcagni and provided her a copy. I moved to
               Interview Room B with Calcagni and asked her about her concern
               with domestic violence. Calcagni started to cry and said she
               would be ok. I explained to Calcagni that it concerns me when
               people mention those things. I took out an ATVP domestic

               violence card and marked the phone number for ATVP and
               Counseling Services. Calcagni said she just needed somewhere to
               go. I explained that ATVP could help her with that and asked if
               I could call an advocate to come talk with her. Calcagni said
               she did not want to do that. I attempted several times to have
               either Calcagni or me call ATVP, but she said she would do it
               later. I asked Calcagni if there has been history of abuse and
               she said there had. I asked Calcagni if it happened on campus
               or off and she said both. I asked Calcagni if she would talk to
               me about it and she said no. I asked Calcagni if she would tell
               me her boyfriend's name and she said no. I provided Calcagni
               with the DV card as well as a Victim's Rights card. I asked
               Calcagni if she thought her boyfriend would come over tonight
               and she said yes. I told Calcagni not to let him into the
               building and to call 911 if he shows up. I gave Calcagni a
               courtesy transport to Orton Hall. I provided Calcagni with the
               Tow/Impound Form and explained it to her. I walked Calcagni to
               her room and made sure her boyfriend wasn't there. I reiterated
               to call 911 if her boyfriend shows up. I called the on duty RED
               (Joshua McPhatter) and explained the situation to him. I asked
               if the RA from the floor could be notified just to keep an ear
               out for anything. McPhatter said he would notify the RED of
               Orton (Jena Doolittle) and notify her of what was going on. I
               called ATVP and spoke with an advocate. I asked if there was
               anything further I could do to assist Calcagni and they said
               there was not anything else to do. I drove by Orton Hall
               several times and saw nothing out of the ordinary. I sent an
               email to WSU Counseling services to notified them. I attached
               the email to the case. I briefed Ofc. Welter and Ofc. Tiengo on
               the case. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 25th day of August,
               2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3685 SYNOPSIS: Subject arrested for
               MOMVACA. Subject refused BAC and was cited with MIP Exhibiting.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Katie A. Teter 05/05/96
               Cited/Released MIP Exhibiting 5Z0942153 2. NARRATIVE: On
               08/25/15 at approximately 0121 hours I was driving northbound
               on Stadium Way approaching North Fairway when I noticed a red
               Toyota Rav4 heading southbound towards me. The Toyota appeared
               to be traveling faster than the posted 20 MPH zone. I activated
               my in car radar (vehicle 4) and obtained a reading of 31 MPH.
               As I was turning around to stop the car I noticed the Toyota
               was still accelerating. I caught up to the Toyota at a red
               light at the intersection of Stadium Way and Grimes Way. I
               initiated a traffic stop at Stadium Way and the CUE parking
               garage. I contacted the driver, Katie Alisha Teter 05/05/96,
               and before I could say anything Teter began to tell me how she
               was in a hurry to pick up an intoxicated friend at the
               Stephenson Complex. Teter continued to tell me that she just
               had "dropped off 10 people who were super drunk." Teter also
               told me that she was super tired and sorry. I asked Teter what
               she was sorry about. Teter replied, "whatever I did." Teter
               provided her WADL that identified her as 19 years old. While
               standing at the driver's side window I could smell the odor of
               intoxicants coming from the car. I asked Teter if she had been
               drinking and she said no. I asked Teter if I could check her
               eyes and she said I could. I told Teter to square her shoulders
               up to mine as best she could. I performed an HGN test as Teter
               sat in her car. During the test I observed equal tracking,
               equal pupil size, and lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes.
               Teter's eyes were watery. I asked Teter, "so you have not had
               anything at all." Teter hesitated when answering and again said
               no. I told Teter that she had to think about her answer. I
               asked Teter if she was willing to be a little bit more honest
               with me. Teter said, "I've had a few." Teter began to cry. I
               asked Teter if she was willing to provide a PBT sample. Teter
               asked if she had to and I told Teter that it was voluntary.
               Teter said she did not want to. I told Teter to come talk to me
               outside of the car. Which she did. Seeing that there was not a
               safe location for SFTS I decided that we would walk up the
               grassy hill to our left. I knew there was an elevated sidewalk
               on top of the hill that we could use. Once we reached the
               sidewalk I asked Teter to face me and she stumbled to her left
               while trying to stop walking. I asked Teter if she was willing
               to do some voluntary field sobriety tests. Teter asked if she

               had to. I asked Teter what I had just told her. Teter said,
               "yes." I told Teter that I said voluntary. Teter did not answer
               my question so I asked Teter if I could look at her eyes. Teter
               said I could. I administered was the HGN test. I instructed
               Teter to stand with her heels and toes together and keep her
               arms at her sides. I told Teter to follow the tip of my pen
               with her eyes only and not to move her head. I held my pen
               approximately 12-15 inches away from Teter's head. During the
               test I observed, equal pupil size, equal tracking, lack of
               smooth pursuit, and distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum
               deviation in both eyes. Teter was swaying forwards and
               backwards during the test. As Teter stood before me I could
               clearly smell the strong odor of intoxicants coming from her
               breath. I asked Teter how much she really had to drink tonight
               and Teter said, "six shots and four beers." I again asked Teter
               if she was willing to do the field sobeity tests and Teter
               said, "no I'm going to get in trouble, no if because if I do
               them I'm going to..." I told Teter I needed a clear yes or no.
               Teter said no. I told Teter that she was under arrest for minor
               operating a moving vehicle after consuming alcohol and
               handcuffed (D/L). Teter was advised she was being audio and
               video recorded. I walked Teter back to my patrol car and read
               her Miranda Rights of my department issued card. I placed Teter
               in the backseat of my patrol car and asked her what she wanted
               to do with her car. Teter gave me permission to park her car. I
               parked Teter's car in the Krugal parking lot and locked the
               doors. I transported Teter to Pullman Holding Facility for BAC.
               Upon arrival I found the Draeger in working condition. At 0143
               hours I checked Teter's mouth finding no foreign substances. I
               read Teter her Constitutional Rights at 0146 hours. Teter
               stated she understood her rights and signed she understood her
               rights and decided not to exercise her rights. I read Teter the
               Implied Consent Warning for Breath and I signed that I had read
               it to her at 0146 hours. Teter began to ask questions about the
               Implied Consent Form. I told Teter that I am only allowed to
               read the form and not deviate from it. I gave the form to Teter
               and she read it. Teter looked at the form for several minutes
               and signed. I told Teter to check the yes or no box indicating
               whether she was willing to provide a breath sample or not.
               Teter checked the no box. I placed Teter in a holding cell as I
               completed the breath ticket. I completed a refusal ticket.
               Teter was issued a Sector citation for MIP Exhibiting. I
               explained the citation to Teter and provided her with her copy.
               Teter was fingerprinted and photographed. Teter was provided
               with a driver's hearing request and the breath test document.
               Teter was released from custody. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 25th day of
               August, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3686 SYNOPSIS: Subject reported mental
               health issues. Medics, RED, and I responded. RED and subject
               have plans for the morning. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 082515 at approximately 0130
               hours I was en route to back Ofc. Westerman while he was
               testing but diverted to a call dispatched as a Sickness
               regarding a mental health issue. The call was dispatched to
               medics. I responded and ran into RED Tran on the way. She told
               me she was familiar with the subject we were responding to.
               Tran and I met with Abagail N. Khachadoorian (071197). She did
               not give me too many specifics but said she had been
               disassociated from herself and had issues with reality or
               believing things were real. She reported a history of mental
               health issues to include in patient care. Medics arrived and
               she repeated the same for them. She felt she was not in crisis
               and that she had no plans to hurt herself and I outright asked
               if she was suicidal. She said she was not. The medics called
               PRH to see if they would be able to do anything for her at the
               time and they felt she would be best served by waiting until
               the morning. Medics cleared. Tran and Khachadoorian made a plan
               to go to Counseling Services in the morning. I cleared. Nothing
               follows. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 25th day of August, 2015, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer
