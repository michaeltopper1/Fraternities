               was checked and found to be taking up an unnecessary amount of
               space but due to poor lot markings no infraction was issued.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               08/29/15 at about 1940 hrs Dispatch advised of a complaint
               regarding a vehicle that was "double parked" in a parking lot
               by Gannon Hall, preventing the complainant from parking in the
               lot. I responded and located the subject vehicle, CA 6WRT584,
               which was parked in the lot in front of Gannon Hall, along
               Stadium Way. The vehicle was parked at a slight angle, causing
               it to take up the parking space it was in and what would have
               been a foot or so of the space next to it. The parking lot
               lines were all faded and the one between the two parking stalls
               in question was no longer visible. Due to the lack of a marking
               separating the two parking stalls no infraction was issued.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 29 day of August, 2015, in

               (012095). I located one of the leaders of Delta Tau Delta,
               Samuel S. Cook (061594) who I knew from previous contacts. I
               asked for his help identifying Abrams and he did. We found
               Abrams sitting on the beach with a large straw hat on,
               presumably to conceal himself. Abrams initially ignored
               commands to stand up and come with Ranger Lorz and me. After
               multiple orders to do so, he relented and we walked up to the
               parking lot and to Ranger Lorz's truck. Abrams remained
               uncooperative throughout our contact. He slurred his speech,
               had bloodshot and watery eyes. When I asked what he had drank
               he told me that that information was personal. I asked on a
               scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the most intoxicated he has been,
               what number would he be at, he said "10", and requested an
               ambulance. It appeared he did so to manipulate the situation.
               At this time we were in Garfield County which had all of it's
               resources dedicated to a wild fire. The closest available
               ambulance was dispatched from Colfax. When Abrams heard this,
               he said the ambulance could be canceled. I could smell the odor
               of intoxicants on Abrams breath, even with the strong wind. I
               checked his eyes and observed a lack of smooth pursuit and
               distinct and sustained nystagmus in both eyes. He declined a
               PBT and asked for a lawyer. Ranger Lorz issued Abrams a
               citation for obstructing him via a Federal CFR statue requiring
               a mandatory appearance in Federal Court in Spokane. Ranger Lorz
               also plans on forwarding his information to Student Conduct.
               Abrams was free to go back to the beach. It should be noted how
               cooperative and helpful Cook was in this event. We cleared and
               returned to the dunes. Nothing follows. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               29th day of August, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               at approximately 1140 hours I was on foot at the Ilia Dunes
               when I observed John T. Tracy (040495) standing on the side of
               the restrooms and urinating on the building. I could see a
               stream of liquid coming from his waist area. When he turned he
               did not have any other artificial apparatus that would have
               emitted a liquid. I saw that he appeared to be under the age of
               21. I had him walk with me a few feet away from the bathrooms.
               Tracy slurred his speech when speaking. He said he slurred his
               speech because I made him nervous. I could smell the odor of
               intoxicants on his breath as the location we were at was more
               sheltered from the wind. Tracy denied urinating on the building
               though I was approximately 6 feet away from him when he was
               doing it. He later admitted to doing it. I checked his eyes and
               observed a lack of smooth pursuit and distinct and sustained
               nystagmus in both eyes. He stated he had only had 2 drinks. He
               was free to go. Student Conduct only. I cleared. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of

               approximately 2105 hours I was dispatched to drugs call at
               Wilmer Davis room 113. The RED on duty was reporting the odor
               of marijuana. Upon arrival I went to room 113 but was unable to
               smell the odor of marijuana coming from within the door. I
               knocked on the door and two females answered. Kathy Thanh Phan
               12/10/96 and Madeline Elizabeth Winter 12/12/96 were identified
               as the two. Phan lives in room 113 and Winter lives in room
               111. While speaking with the two I could not smell any odor of
               marijuana. Ofc. Boyd who was on scene could not smell any odor
               of marijuana. I thanked the two for their time and left the
               room. I spoke with the RA's who first found the odor. The RA's
               stated that they had smelled the odor about 30 to 45 minutes
               ago. I asked why they took so long to call it in and the RAs
               said that by policy they have to wait until the RED arrives to
               call it in which took 30 to 45 minutes. I provided the RA's
               with the case number and cleared. This case can be closed out
               as unfounded as there was no evidence of marijuana usage. END

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3823 SYNOPSIS: Report of possible
               domestic dispute. No primary aggressor. One party arrested on
               warrants by PPD. Other party charges forwarded for MIP-
               exhibiting. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Erin I
               Roach 01/13/98 Charges Forwarded MIP-Exhibiting 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 08/30/15 at approximately 0003 hours WSUPD was emergency
               dispatched to a possible domestic dispute in the area of the
               Valley Rd. playfields. The reporting party said she could hear
               a female yelling "let go of me". The reporting party could see
               a black male and a white female. Ofc. Myklebust (PPD) arrived
               on scene first and told Whitcom that he was in the parking lot
               to the bathrooms of the playfield. I arrived on scene and saw a
               black male in handcuffs on the ground in the parking lot with
               Ofc. Myklebust standing next to him. Ofc. Myklebust pointed to
               a female sitting on the curb across the parking lot. Ofc.
               Westerman arrived on scene around this time. I went to the
               female, verbally identified as Erin I. Roach 01/13/98, and
               asked what happened. Roach said that her boyfriend (the male
               with Ofc. Myklebust), identified as Michael C. McFarland, and
               she were arguing. I asked Roach if anything physical happened
               between them and she said she slapped him. I asked Roach where
               she slapped him and she said on his arm. I asked Roach which
               hand she used and she said her left hand. I over heard
               McFarland tell Ofc. Myklebust that Roach slapped him. I asked
               Roach if McFarland hit her and she said no. I noticed a scratch
               on her left elbow and asked about it. Roach said it happened
               about an hour and a half ago. I looked closer and noticed what
               looked like black mascara on the scratch, but I did not know
               for sure what it was. I went over to McFarland and heard Ofc.
               Myklebust reading McFarland his Miranda Rights. I asked
               McFarland if Roach slapped him and he said she did. I asked
               McFarland where she slapped him and he said his face and told
               me it hurt. Ofc. Myklebust then asked McFarland what happened
               after that and McFarland said he pushed Roach into a car. I
               went to the vehicle and looked at it. I noticed the front
               driver's side mirror was pushed forward and I could see dust
               rubbed off of the door. This is consistent with McFarland's
               story. There was no damage to the vehicle. While I was speaking
               with Roach I could smell a strong odor of intoxicants on her
               breath and I noticed her eyes were bloodshot and watery. I
               asked Roach how old she was and she said 17. I asked Roach if
               she would provide a PBT sample and she agreed to do so. Roach
               provided a PBT sample of .123 at 0019 hours. I asked Roach

               about getting pushed by McFarland and she denied being pushed.
               I would assume the scratch and the black matter on her arm came
               from being pushed into the mirror. Since there was no primary
               aggressor and McFarland was going to jail on a warrant I
               decided not to arrest Roach for Assault IV. Charges forwarded
               for MIP-Exhibiting. It should be noted that Roach admitted to
               staying with McFarland in Moscow at his house. McFarland is a
               registered sex offender and Roach is a juvenile. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 08/30/15 at approximately 0035
               hours I was driving westbound on Cougar Way when I looked to my
               right and saw a group of about 10 individuals between
               Hollingberry Field House and Bohler Gym. Two people in
               particular seemed agitated. As I started to drive towards them
               I saw a male, later identified as Kirkland Dewayne Parker
               12/10/94, push another unidentified male backwards. As I pulled
               up to the group people started running in all directions and I
               told Parker to sit down. Another male, Hunter Michael Dale
               12/22/95, also stayed behind. I asked Parker what was going on.
               Parker said he and Dale were walking to the Football Operations
               building to get something to eat when a group of four males
               approached them. Parker said the group of males were made up
               of, one Asian male, one White male, and two Black males. Parker
               said the Asian male said, "what's up my Nigga." Parker took
               offense to this. Parker also said the Asian male grabbed Dale's
               hair but Dale and Parker did not know why. Parker was trying to
               keep the Asian male away from Dale. Parker said he was slapped
               in the face by the Asian male so Parker pushed him away. Parker
               said that was when I showed up. I asked Parker if he knew any
               of the four and he said he did not. Parker stated that he did
               not want to press charges against the Asian male. I provided
               Parker with my business card and told him to contact me if
               anything else happens. END OF REPORT I certify and declare

               sexual assault. Anonymous victim. Case forwarded to OEO for
               Title IX compliance. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               Bryce C. Linna 05/04/95 Person of Interest Sex Assault 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 08/30/15 at approximately 0055 hours I was
               dispatched to a cold sexual assault with the reporting party
               wanting contact at WSUPD. I responded to WSUPD and met with
               Anastasia M. Fish 04/06/96 in the conference room. Also present
               were two cadre from Army ROTC. I asked Fish if she was ok with
               the other two subjects present and she said she was. I asked
               Fish to tell me what happened. Fish explained that a friend of
               her (who wants to remain anonymous) reported to her that on
               08/28/15 at approximately 2200 hours she was raped by Bryce C.
               Linna at Global Scholars Hall. I asked Fish where in the hall
               it occurred and she said in the victim's bedroom. Fish said
               both people had been drinking and the victim described herself
               as "pretty out of it". Fish explained that the victim and Linna
               had walked back to Global Scholars hall from a party. The
               victim allowed Linna to come up and they began kissing. The
               victim told Linna she did not want to go any further. Linna
               continued to make out with her and it became sexual in nature.
               The victim told Fish that Linna proceeded to "rape" her and
               ejaculated without using a condom. Fish said the victim told
               her that Linna left afterwards. Fish explained that Linna was
               recently dropped from his fraternity because of other
               allegations of other sexual assaults. Fish said that the victim
               told 3 other people, one of which was a sorority sister who
               told her that it wasn't Linna's "first time". I asked Fish if
               she would give me the name of the victim. Fish explained that
               the victim did not want any of it reported, but she (Fish) felt
               like she had to report the incident. Fish explained that the
               victim would not want to press charges and she did not want me
               contacting her. I told Fish that what would happen from this
               point is that the case would get sent over for a Title IX
               compliance officer to follow up with. I provided Fish with my
               business card and contact information for counseling services.
               I suggested that she contact counseling services because she
               seemed very bothered by the incident. I told Fish to have the
               victim contact me if she changed her mind about reporting the
               incident. Forward case to OEO for Title IX compliance. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 30th day of August, 2015, in Pullman,

               08/20/15 at about 0124 hrs I was driving northbound on Spokane
               St. approaching Campus St. when I noticed a male and two
               females who were turning the corner to walk south on Spokane
               St. from Campus St. They caught my attention because the male,
               later identified as Christaldo Rodriguez (020696), appeared to
               be under 21 and was having difficulty walking, staggering side
               to side. The females, who were not identified, were walking one
               on either side of him and he had one arm around each of them
               for balance. I stopped and contacted the group. They said they
               were taking Rodriguez to his dorm at Gannon Goldsworthy. I
               asked Rodriguez how much he had to drink and he said quite a
               bit. I noticed he spoke with slurred speech. I asked how old he
               was and he admitted to being under 21. I asked if he had ID and
               initially he said he did not. I walked behind him and told him
               his ID was probably in the wallet in his back pocket. He then
               removed his wallet and provided me with his Driver's License,
               which confirmed he was 19 years old. I asked Rodriguez if I
               could check his eyes and he agreed. I administered a horizontal
               gaze nystagmus on him and observed he had bloodshot and watery
               eyes, a lack of smooth pursuit, and a distinct and sustained
               nystagmus in both eyes. I could smell the odor of intoxicants
               on his breath as I administered the test. I told Rodriguez I
               would be referring the incident to student conduct and he was
               released. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 30 day of August,

               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               08/30/15 at 0140 hours WSUPD was emergency dispatched to a
               domestic dispute on NE Fariway Dr. near the SRC. The reporting
               party stated they heard a male yell at a female to "come here
               right now". I arrived shortly after the call was dispatched and
               found a male and a female matching the description by the
               tennis courts. They did not appear to be arguing. I contacted
               them and asked if everything was ok. Both parties said
               everything was ok and they seemed to be in good spirits. Once I
               explained the situation I learned that the female, identified
               as Sara N. Hoffmann 11/15/91, had ran across the street to run
               through a sprinkler that just turned on. A vehicle, presumably
               the reporting party, drove by and yelled something to Hoffmann.
               At this point the male, Joseph D. Glick, yelled at Hoffmann to
               come back across the street. We all had a good laugh and Glick
               reminisced how both Ofc. Westerman and I had contacted him
               previously. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,

               identified as John Harper George-Bradley 03/14/97, sitting on a
               couch in the lobby area. I asked John his name and he said
               John. I asked Bradley if he had his ID with him and Bradley
               said no. I asked Bradley how he got into the building and
               Bradley did not answer. I again asked Bradley how he got into
               the building and Bradley stated "I got let in." I attempted to
               get Bradley's name several times however Bradley kept giving me
               numerous variations of his name. Bradley was not making a lot
               of sense. I asked Bradley a series questions to determine his
               mental status. Bradley was able to correctly answer a few
               questions however he answered other incorrectly. Once medics
               arrived they determined that Bradley did not need medical
               attention. I asked Bradley if he was WSU Student and he said
               no. I asked Bradley if he was staying with someone in Streit
               Perham and he said no. When asked again how he got into the
               building Bradley said he waited around until someone opened the
               door. Bradley was not making a lot of sense other than that he
               was visiting WSU, was not a student, and did not have a legal
               right to be in the locked building. I told Bradley that he was
               being detained until I could figure out his identity. I walked
               Bradley out of the building where he was handcuffed (D/L) and
               detained in the backseat of my patrol car. I read Bradley his
               Miranda Rights off my department issued card. Bradley stated he
               understood his rights and wished to continue to speak with me.
               I again tried to get Bradley's name and date of birth but he
               was still giving me different variations. I ran several of the
               different names Bradley gave me but none came back with a
               return. Bradley told me that he did not have a driver's license
               but should have an ID card through Washington. After several
               minutes of trying to get a return for Bradley, I told him he
               was under arrest for Criminal Trespass and transported him to
               the Pullman Holding Facility. It is my belief that Bradley was
               not purposefully trying to lie about his name but rather so
               intoxicated that he could not give it properly. While en route

               to the holding facility, Bradley began to vomit. I pulled to
               the side of the road and leaned Bradley out of the car so he
               could continue vomiting. Once completed we reached the holding
               facility. Once at the holding facility, Bradley was searched
               incident to arrest. During the search I located a sandwich bag
               of marijuana in Bradley's right breast pocket of his jacket. I
               asked Bradley what the marijuana was and Bradley said, "a pile
               of weed." Bradley was placed in a holding cell. I returned a
               few hours later in hopes that Bradley had sobered up enough for
               him to properly identify himself. Bradley was now able to fully
               provide his information. Bradley told me that he has never been
               issued a government ID card other than a school ID. Bradley did
               not know his social security number. I asked Bradley for his
               legal guardian's info. Bradley provided his grandmother's name
               of, Linda S. Bradley 12/06/50, and her phone number. I called
               Linda who confirmed Bradley's information. Linda stated she
               also was aware that Bradley was in Pullman. I returned to
               Bradley and told him that since he is 18 years old he should
               probably get a Washington ID card incase he is contacted by law
               enforcement in the future. I told Bradley that he was being
               charged with Criminal Trespassing in the 1st degree and
               Possession of Marijuana Less than 40 grams. I issued Bradley a
               Sector citation for those two charges and explained the
               citation. Bradley was fingerprinted and photographed. I asked
               Bradley where he was staying. Bradley stated he was staying in
               the Marriott Hotel with friends. I transported Bradley to the
               Marriott. After dropping Bradley off at the Marriott, I
               cleared. Once back at the station the seized marijuana NIC
               tested presumptive positive for marijuana. The marijuana was
               logged into evidence. END OF REPORT I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 30th day of
               August, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               NARRATIVE: On 08/30/15 at approximately 0350 hours I responded
               to Yakima Apts. #648 for a fall. Upon arrival I found a female
               subject, identified as Zishan Li, laying on the ground.
               Zishan's hands were balled up and she was having labored
               breathing. I asked the male subject standing over her what
               happened. The male, identified as Ziadong Lang, said that they
               were arguing and Zishan got so mad she began to tense up. Lang
               said that Zishan had done this once before. There was a
               language barrier so I could not quite understand everything. I
               noticed scratches on Lang's right hand and arm. I asked Lang
               about the scratches. Lang showed me a door that he punched and
               explained that he was arguing with him mom and dad (who were
               both present) about Hoffmann. Lang got mad and punched the
               door. I did not see any other indicators of an assault having
               occurred. Medics arrived on scene and confirmed it appeared
               Hoffmann was having an anxiety attack, so I cleared. I certify
