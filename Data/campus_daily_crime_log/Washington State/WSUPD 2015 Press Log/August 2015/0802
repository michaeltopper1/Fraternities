        Incident Address : 2195 SE Olympia Ave; Hitchcock Equine Tr
                           PULLMAN              WA 99163

        Time Reported: 08:12

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: DMJ/338 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3295 08/02/15 SYNOPSIS: Fire alarm at
               Hitchcock Barn, no fire emergency. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On August 2, 2015 at about 0812
               hours Pullman Fire and WSU Police were dispatched to a fire
               alarm at the Hitchcock barn. A passerby heard an audible alarm
               coming from the barn. I responded to the barn. I could hear an
               alarm sounding when I arrived. The barn doors were open and
               there were three (3) sheep inside in pens. Pullman Fire
               personnel and I determined the alarm is a local smoke detector
               that is not connected to an alarm system. Pullman Fire
               personnel used a can of air to blow out the smoke detector. It
               was most likely dirty from dust. Barns are dusty places.
               Pullman Fire personnel talked with an employee who was feeding
               animals in the area. No fire emergency found, no further
               investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 2nd day of August, 2015, in
               Pullman, Washington. _______________________________________

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3298 SYNOPSIS: Forwarding charges of
               possession of marijuana < 40 on Jesus D. Chavarin Ramirez
               (112494). He is not a WSU Student. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Jesus D. Chavarin Ramirez (112494) Forwarding
               POM<40 2. NARRATIVE: On 080215 at approximately 1813 hours I
               was driving vehicle 17 northbound on NE Fairway Rd near the
               Tennis Courts when I observed a southbound vehicle (WA/B96688T)
               exceeding the posted 20 mph speed limit. My radar confirmed the
               vehicle was moving at 31 mph. The calibration was verified
               before and after the stop. I activated my emergency lights and
               stopped the vehicle in the tennis court parking lot. I
               contacted the driver, Gabriel Hernandez (120394), and told him
               we were being recorded. I informed him of the reason for the
               stop and requested his WADL, insurance, and registration. He
               could not find a current insurance. I returned to my vehicle
               and ran him via dispatch. He was clear and current. I returned
               to the vehicle and could smell the odor of marijuana. I had
               Hernandez step out of the vehicle and speak with me. He said he
               did not have a medicinal marijuana card but one of his
               passengers, the one in the back seat, had marijuana, and was
               under 21. I had Hernandez wait by the side of his truck. I had
               Jesus D. Chavarin Ramirez (112494) exit the vehicle. He was up
               front and honest with me. He did not have a medicinal marijuana
               card. Chavarin Ramirez handed me a bag containing a green
               vegetable material I recognized as marijuana. I seized it,
               later weighed it out of the bag at 3.4 grams, and then placed
               it in evidence. Chavarin Ramirez also had a glass Seahawks pipe
               but it was new with no residue. I had dispatch verify Chavarin
               Ramirez was eligible for the Whitman County Diversion program
               and they confirmed he had not alcohol or drug involvements and
               a clear criminal history. I informed Chavarin Ramirez he was
               under arrest, that he had the right to an attorney, and that he
               could remain silent. He was not handcuffed. I explained I would
               be forwarding charges to the prosecutor's office for the
               possession of marijuana. Chavarin Ramirez is a student at
               Skagit Valley Community College. He was free to go and I
               cleared. Nothing follows. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 2nd day of August,
               2015, in Pullman, Washington.
