               2. NARRATIVE: On 08/10/15 around 0950 hrs I was dispatched to a
               reported theft of a picture and plaque from the 4th floor of
               the Compton Union Building (CUB). I contacted the complainant,
               later identified as Keree A Shaw (05/27/77), and was told the
               following. Shaw explained she had been notified by custodial
               services of a painting which had been hanging on the wall near
               the elevators on the 4th floor of the CUB. She went on to tell
               me the painting had been donated to the University and she
               currently could not access the value or pictures of the photo
               due to computer problems. I asked her to forward the
               information to me when she could and was told she would. I
               asked about when the last time the picture had been seen and
               was told it was around the closing of the building on 08/07/15,
               which was 1700 hrs. Shaw went on to tell me it had been noticed
               missing on 08/10/15 around 0830 hrs. She had no suspects and no
               leads at this time. Prior to concluding our conversation I
               asked her again to forward the information on the value and
               copy of the picture to me when she was able to. She told me she
               would and I provided her with the case number for reference
               before concluding our conversation. I will add the information
               on the painting and plaque when I receive the information from
               Shaw. No suspects and no leads at this time. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               computer from Surplus Stores. I contacted Ronald L Redman

               Redman explained on 08/08/15 Surplus Stores had a public sale.
               During the sale there were several items available for
               purchase, to include a Sony Vaio Laptop Computer. He went on to
               tell me the public sale began at 1000 hrs and following the end
               of the sale, approximately 1515 hrs, he was notified the Sony
               Vaio was missing. A search of the area was conducted and the
               laptop was not located before Redman reported the theft on
               08/10/15. I asked if he had any idea who may have taken the
               laptop, valued at $750.00, and was told he did not. As we
               continued to speak Redman also told me he did not have a serial
               number for the laptop or any video surveillance systems in the
               building to identify any possible suspects. We discussed this
               for a bit before I asked him to try and serial number as well
               as the model number. I also asked him to email the information
               to me as well as if he heard of anything which might be related
               to this case. He told me would before I provided him with my
               business card and case number for reference before I cleared.
               No suspects and no leads at this time. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: BRW/325 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3397 SYNOPSIS: A group of 6 females
               contacted and warned for stealing a road cone. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Margaret J. Eliasen 10/29/94 2. Kendall

               03/09/95 NARRATIVE: On 08/11/15 at approximately 0054 hours I
               was driving westbound on Cougar Way when I noticed a group of 6
               females walking westbound on Cougar Way. The group appeared to
               be doing nothing out of the ordinary as I drove past them. I
               continued driving on Cougar Way. A few minutes later I was
               driving northbound on Thatuna Street approaching Colorado
               Street when I noticed the same group of 6 walking in the
               crosswalk of Thatuna Street. I saw one of the females was
               carrying a orange road cone that had a reflective stripe on it.
               The group had not been carrying the road cone the first time I
               passed them. There is a lot of construction on Cougar Way and
               the road cone most likely came from one of the construction
               sites. I pulled along the group and told them I needed to speak
               with them. All six stopped. I watched as one female put the
               cone down. I asked the group where the cone came from and one
               female said they had picked it up earlier. The six were
               identified as: -Margaret J. Eliasen 10/29/94 -Kendall M.
               Iverson 03/20/95 -Kathryn M. Nantz 08/07/95 -Shauna M. Walters
               07/25/95 -Holly M. Cocci 06/12/95 -Miranda J. Kretz 03/09/95
               All the females stated they were in town early for sorority
               recruitment week. I explained that walking down the street with
               a stolen road cone was not the best idea expecially if they had
               been drinking. I told the six that the best advise I could give
               them is not to give me a reason to stop and talk to them. I
               told the group that it would be best for them to walk back to
               where they took the cone and put it back. The group agreed.
               While talking to the group I could smell the odor of
               intoxicants coming from the group but I did not question them
               about it as all appeared to be walking fine. END OF REPORT I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 11th day of August, 2015, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer
