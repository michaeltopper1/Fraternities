               the Bookie. The subject was cited and released. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Suh, Lydia Y (10/11/96) Cited and
               released Theft 3rd C-10176 2. NARRATIVE: On 08/17/15 around
               1020 hrs I was dispatched to the Bookie for a report of a
               shoplifter in custody. Upon my arrival I contacted the store
               manager, later identified as Leslie A Martin (10/02/64), who
               told me the following. Martin explained an employee, Lioubov M
               Baugh (11/29/53), had contacted a female for trying to leave
               the Bookie with items she had not paid for, which totaled
               $56.01 with tax. The hat was valued at $21.98 before tax, and
               the shirt was valued at $29.98 before tax. The values listed in
               Spillman were rounded up to the next dollar amount for
               documentation purposes. The female contacted by Baugh, later
               identified as Lydia Y Suh (10/11/96), later admitted to taking
               a baseball hat and t-shirt, which she placed into her bag of
               items she had paid for before trying to leave the store. As
               Baugh spoke with Suh she was told Suh had taken the items
               because she didn't have the money to pay for them. Suh was
               escorted to Martin's office where I was contacted and
               responded. Upon my arrival I spoke with Martin briefly before
               talking to Suh. Martin explained she would like Suh cited for
               the theft, which was her store's policy. I told her that would
               be fine and asked her to contact Baugh and explain I would need
               a written statement from her regarding what she had seen. She
               told me that would be fine and I went to speak with Suh. Upon
               contacting Suh I activated my video and told her I was
               recording the contact with her. She told me that was fine and
               before proceeding further I read her her Miranda Warnings from
               my printed card. After finishing reading her rights to her, Suh
               told me she understood her rights and wished to answer my
               questions. I sat down next to her and asked her why she had
               taken the items. She told me she did not have the money to pay
               for the items and admitted to having taken the items anyway.
               She went on to tell me she has never been in trouble before and
               after speaking with her for a short period of time I explained
               I was going to issue her a criminal citation for theft and she
               would not be going to jail. A short time later I issued her a
               criminal citation (C-10176) for theft 3rd and after explaining
               the citation to her explained she was being trespassed from the
               Bookie, per their request. Suh asked how long she was being
               trespassed for and Martin told her it would be for 1 year, at
               which point I explained if she were caught in the Bookie during

               that time she could be subject to arrest for that. She told me
               she understood and a short time later she collected her items
               and was escorted from the store. I returned and spoke with
               Martin briefly at which time she handed me a statement written
               and signed by Baugh regarding the incident. After reviewing the
               statement, which explained what I had been told earlier, I
               collected my items along with the statement written by Baugh
               and turned the hat and shirt back over to Martin before
               clearing. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 17th day of August,

               exit of the WSU Student Health and Wellness building. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 08-17-15, I
               responded to the parking lot near the rear entrance of the WSU
               Student Health and Wellness building for a non-injury accident.
               Upon my arrival, Rachel A. Wix (11-27-78), said she back her
               vehicle (WA/AQU6937) into ID/9ABMS. Wix said her vehicle had
               been parked in a parking stall and when she began backing out
               of the parking stall, she backed into ID/9ABMS. I asked Wix to
               gather her Driver's License, Vehicle Registration, and Proof of
               Liability Insurance while I took photos of the damage to both
               vehicles. Wix's vehicle (WA/AQU6937) sustained damage to the
               passenger side rear bumper area, causing scrapes in the paint
               and the bumper to go slightly out of line. I estimate the
               damage to Wix's vehicle to be $300. I determined ID/9ABMS was
               registered to Sunday D. Henry (08-25-74) and was able to
               contact her and have her respond to her parked vehicle. Her
               vehicle sustained damage to the passenger side rear door area,
               causing scrapes to the paint and the body to be dented in. I
               estimate the damage to Henry's vehicle to be $650. I gave Wix
               and Henry my business card with the Police case number on it
               and advised both of them to contact their insurance companies.
               Once back at the station, I downloaded the photos into the
               "Files" section of the case. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3517 SYNOPSIS: Report of an
               argumentative and intoxicated male in Northside. Unable to
               locate. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 081715 at approximately 1813 hours we were dispatched to the
               report of an argumentative and intoxicated male in Northside.
               He had required assistance in getting into the building. Sgt.
               Griffin and I responded and met with RED Lee. He informed us
               that the male had been arguing with his roommate and was
               intoxicated. Lee felt his was a 6 out of 10 in terms of
               intoxication. The subject was believed to be a "Devon" and
               living in room 264. No one answered that door when we knocked
               on it. Devon was described as a white male, 5'11", and with
               brown hair, dressed mostly in black. We checked the rest of the
               floor and could not locate Devon. Lee said he would complete
               his report to send to Student Conduct and I requested his send
               me Devon's full name. We cleared. I will add Devon's
               information when I receive it. Case closed. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               17th day of August, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: JAK/333 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3518 SYNOPSIS: Hall staff reported the
               odor of marijuana emitting from within Goldsworthy Hall; room
               423. Officers responded, but no one answer the room door.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 08-17-
               15, Whitcom advised the Hall Staff at Goldsworthy Hall had
               called in the odor of marijuana and were requesting an Officer
               to respond. Sgt. Griffin and I responded and met the Resident
               Advisor in the lobby of Gannon / Goldsworthy Halls. He walked
               us up to the 4th floor of Goldsworthy Hall and opened the floor
               door. As soon as I entered the floor I could smell a strong
               odor of marijuana. As I approached the door to room 423 the
               odor became strongest. Edwin Serrano, the "On Call" Residential
               Educational Director, was in the hallway across from the room.
               I asked if he knew if there were people inside the room or not
               and he said he thought he had heard voices coming from inside
               the room. I knocked on the door and announced "Police
               Department, Open the door" and received no answer. I did this
               several more times and still received no answer. I did not hear
               any voices from inside the room while we were in the hallway. I
               advised Serrano it would be best if they tried contacting the
               assigned room occupants at a later time as they did not appear
               to be home. I advised him I would create a report and have it
               forwarded to the WSU Office of Student Standards and
               Accountability for their review. I also advised him he could
               call us back if the residents returned. The Resident Advisor,
               Jordan A. Munson, sent me an e-mail stating the assigned room
               occupants are Antonio Benito (WSU ID 011476115) and Austin K.
               Weber (WSU ID 0114466105). I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 17th day of August,

               081715 I responded to Global Scholars Hall for the odor of
               marijuana that was "strong enough to kill a horse". I met with
               RED Lee and he directed me to room 225. The hallway did have a
               significant odor of marijuana and it was strongest at this
               room. I knocked on the and Rachel M. Schilb (053097) answered
               the door. The odor of marijuana increased. I instructed her to
               have all the occupants exit the room and bring everything they
               were not supposed to have. Schilb, Wesley J. Bradley (042696),
               Emily A. Schilb (010796), and Mollie M. Jacobs (120195) exited
               the room. Emily had a plastic bag of marijuana and Rachel had a
               pipe. I had Emily dispose of the marijuana and Rachel was
               directed to get the pipe out of the hall or throw it out. They
               denied smoking in the room but I found that hard to believe
               based on the strength of the odor. Emily stated they had been
               walking around outside and smoking. None of them had a medical
               marijuana card. I told them they would all be referred to
               Student Conduct. I cleared. Nothing follows. I certify and

               08/18/15 at approximately 0050 hours I responded to Streit Hall
               for the report of an intoxicated juvenile on the 2nd floor. I
               responded to the second floor and met the reporting party
               Nickolas A. Camarata (RA on Duty). I asked Camarata what was
               going on. Camarata said that the resident of room 213 had a
               friend over who was intoxicated. The resident of room 213,
               Gabriel Cocking, was in the hallway. Cocking explained that his
               friend Quentin Neumann came to visit and was drunk. Cocking
               said he was supposed to be watching Neumann, but Neumann had
               left his room and was knocking on doors and squeezed out
               toothpaste. Cocking was very apologetic and let me in his room
               to talk with Neumann. I found Neumann laying on the bed in the
               room. I asked Neumann if he was going to continue his
               shenanigans. Neumann said he swore to god that he would go to
               sleep. I told Neumann I would call his dad to come pick him up
               if he continued. Neumann then swore on his life that he would
               behave, and we shook on it. Neumann's speech was slurred and he
               had the odor of intoxicants on his breath while he spoke.
               Neumann was polite and cooperative while I dealt with him.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
