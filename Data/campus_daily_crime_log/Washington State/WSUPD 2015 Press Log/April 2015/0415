               about 1449 hours I was dispatched to the report of drugs
               observed in McEachern E26 by custodial staff. I called the
               reporting party, Hannah M. Mitchell (09/09/85), as requested.
               Mitchell is the Residential Education Director for McEachern
               Hall. Mitchell told me custodial or maintenance staff entered
               the room for a utilities issue. Upon entry someone saw what
               appeared to be a glass jar of marijuana. The resident was not
               home at the time staff made entry into the room. This happened
               sometime earlier in the day. Mitchell was told to report the
               drugs to the police. According to Mitchell, the person who
               lives at E26 is Nader Y. Shihadeh (06/24/91). He is 23 years of
               age. I called Shihadeh at about 1508 hours and spoke with him
               on the telephone. I explained that staff entered his room for
               utilities repair and they observed what appears to be a jar of
               marijuana. I educated Shihadeh on the Washington State laws for
               marijuana possession as well as the WAC's that govern the WSU
               campus including his housing contract. I told him he could not
               use, possess or store marijuana in his room on the WSU campus.
               It is unknown what substance(s) was actually in the jar. I
               provided Shihadeh education on marijuana laws. No infractions,
               citations, or charges issued. The case shall be referred to WSU
               Student Standards and Accountability for review. No further
               investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 15th day of April, 2015, in

               an acquaintance a key to her apartment and would now like it
               back. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               April 15, 2015 at about 1451 hours I was dispatched to a
               reported theft at Terrace Apartment 804. I responded to the
               apartment where I contacted the complainant, Karissa R.
               Montgomery (01/25/95). Montgomery told me she had let a female
               acquaintance live in her apartment for about a short period of
               time. The person has since moved out and not returned the key
               to the apartment. Montgomery is the lease holder for the
               apartment. She lives in Terrace 801 with her husband.
               Montgomery gave the key to a female named "Vanessa". Montgomery
               said Vanessa's last name may be "Slape" but was not sure.
               According to Montgomery, Vanessa is not returning the key due
               to an item that was broken when she moved out. WSU Housing will
               charge Montgomery $60.00 to change the locks if both keys are
               not returned upon the end of the lease. Montgomery last was in
               contact with Vanessa about a month ago. It is unknown where is
               currently living. I was provided with a telephone number of
               360-326-5428 for Vanessa. I talked with Montgomery about how
               this is a civil issue because she gave the other person the
               key. I explained civil remedies through small claims court. I
               did however tell her that I will make an attempt to contact
               Vanessa and ask for the key to be returned. The investigation
               continues. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 15th day of April, 2015, in Pullman,

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: ENW/328 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1776 SYNOPSIS: Report of a vehicle
               illegally parked and creating a hazard. The owner was contacted
               and the vehicle was removed and parked legally. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 04-15-15 around 2243
               hrs I was dispatched to a report of a vehicle (RI. 335101)
               which was parked in the front parking lot of Gannon Hall. The
               complainant was anonymous but explained the vehicle was
               reported to have been parked along the yellow curb and next to
               a dumpster, creating issues with other vehicles being able to
               safely park or leave. I asked Whitcom if they could locate a
               local invovlement with the vehicle and found it returned to an
               individual, later identified as Andrew C Huh (10-05-94), and
               contacted him. He told me his vehicle was parked at Gannon Hall
               and after explaining the situation to him told me he would move
               it. I thanked him and cleared the call a short time later.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 15th day of April, 2015, in
               Pullman, Washington. _______________________________________
