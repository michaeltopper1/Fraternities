               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1931 04/23/15 SYNOPSIS: Request for a
               plain clothes officer to be outside of College Hall, room 146,
               during a class on Wednesday, April 29, 2015 at 0900 hours.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On April
               23, 2015 at about 0955 hours I was dispatched to a call
               requesting a plainclothes officer for a class next week. I
               called the reporting party, Melissa D. Parkhurst. Parkhurst
               asked for a plainclothes officer to be in the hallway outside
               of College 146 on Wednesday, April 29, 2015 at 0900 hours. The
               detail is approximately two (2) hours long. Parkhurst told me
               WSU doctoral student Kent S. Godfrey (08/14/73) will be taking
               a "preliminary exam" toward a graduate degree. During this exam
               Godfrey will be in front of a committee of six (6) faculty
               members. This is an interactive exam where he will be
               questioned by the committee and have to defend himself orally.
               Passing the preliminary exam is a step toward defending a
               dissertation. Parkhurst is concerned about Godfrey because this
               is the second and final time he can take this exam. If he fails
               he will be asked to leave the program. Godfrey has made no
               threats but his actions and attitude are alarming to faculty.
               He has been acting paranoid and his attitude rapidly changes.
               Godfrey will show up at Parkhurst's office unannounced, without
               an appointment. Godfrey has been reported in the Aware system
               to the WSU Dean of Students Office. Parkhurst spoke with Karen
               Fischer in the WSU Dean of Students Office about the upcoming
               exam and her concerns about Godfrey. WSU Police will have an
               officer at the requested location on April 29, 2015. No further
               investigation at this time. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 23rd day of April,
               2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               activation at McCoy Hall, no fire emergency found. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On April 23, 2015
               at about 1411 hours Pullman Fire and WSU Police were dispatched
               to a fire alarm activation at McCoy Hall. I responded to the
               building. When I arrived I was told a surgery team remained
               inside as they were in the middle of a surgery and could not
               leave. The annunciator showed the alarm in McCoy South. After
               extensive searching Pullman Fire personnel and I could not
               determine the cause or exact alarm location. The main alarm
               would not reset. WSU Life Safety responded to assist. Life
               Safety personnel told us they were in McCoy South earlier this
               morning testing the horns. One of the Life Safety personnel
               located an activated pull station on the second floor east side
               of McCoy South. This may have been the same pull station that
               Life Safety used earlier in the day to test. It is plausible
               that older style pull station was not completely reset. In
               addition there was a Vet School employee transferring old
               electronic equipment using a cart near the pull station. If the
               employee bumped the pull station it could have easily
               activated. No fire emergency was located, no further
               investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 23rd day of April, 2015, in

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: ENW/328 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1942 SYNOPSIS: Report of a lost car key
               somewhere between the green row area and Hillside Cafe.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 04-23-
               15 around 1630 hrs I was dispatched to a report of a lost or
               stolen car key from the area of the Hillside Cafe. I contacted
               the complainant, later identified as Shakela L Little (11-14-
               93), and was told the following. Little explained she had
               parked her vehicle in the greek row area around 1015 hrs and
               after locking her vehicle had walked to the Hillside Cafe,
               where she works. Around 1430 hrs she walked back to her vehicle
               and used her door remote to open the door and entered the
               vehicle at which point she realized her ignition key was
               missing. Little retraced her route and upon reaching the
               Hillside Cafe searched the locker room and spoke with
               management regarding the missing key, but failed to locate it.
               As we spoke I asked her if anything else was missing and she
               told me the only thing missing was the ignition key. As we
               continued to speak I asked her if she had checked with the lost
               and found and she told me the only place she had checked was at
               the Hillside Cafe. I told her to check the lost and found at
               the Compton Union Building as well as a the WSU Police
               Department over the next couple of days to see if it had been
               turned in, and she explained the only reason she had called was
               to see if it had been turned in. I told her I would keep and
               eye out for the key and if it was located I would let her know.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this ____ day of _____________,

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1946 SYNOPSIS: Michelle J. Chan (112993)
               reported possibly seeing Nikhil S. Babu (061893) in French Ad.
               She has a protection order against him and he is trespassed
               from WSU campus. Unconfirmed at this point. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 042315 at
               approximately 1830 hours Intern Cody-Berry spoke with Michelle
               J. Chan (112993) outside the PD. He came and got me as it had
               to do with an order violation. I had Chan come into the report
               writing room and tell me what had happened. Chan recounted that
               at approximately 1608 hours she had possibly seen Nikhil S.
               Babu (061893) near Student Conduct in French Administration.
               She said as she walked to the office she saw someone who she
               thought was Babu at the western exit double doors. He was
               wearing a blue shirt, black backpack, and dark blue pants. His
               hair was longer than in his most recent booking photo. Babu was
               talking with someone she thought was a friend based on their
               demeanor. The friend was wearing a white shirt with stripes and
               blue pants. She said he was a college aged Asian. She walked
               out of Babu's line of sight and backed up to look at him. She
               said they made eye contact but he did not make any gesture.
               Chan went into the Conduct Office and left approximately 2
               minutes later. Babu was gone but the Asian male was still
               there. She did not believe he was an employee. On a scale of 1
               to 10, 10 being the most sure, Chan said she had a confidence
               level of 6 or 7 that it was Babu that she saw. She did mention
               that there is another male on campus that looks like Babu but
               she does not know who he is. Dispatch confirmed there is an
               active protection order in place. I contacted Adam Jussel of
               Student Conduct. He sent me a copy of the trespass paperwork
               that was in effect until August of 2015. He said Babu had an
               appeal deadline approaching so he may have come in though he
               would have had needed to be authorized and escorted to do so.
               He checked with his staff and verified that no one had
               authorized him to come to their office. He also confirmed that
               no one had seen him either. I asked Chan if she felt safe at
               this time and she confirmed she did. I provided her with my
               business card with the non-emergency dispatch number and her
               case number. She accepted a ride to her car at the Red RV lot.
               Chan gave me the most current phone number for Babu. It matched
               the one we had in Spillman. I told her I would email her with
               what I had learned. I later did so. I returned to the station
               and checked with the Dean of Students office and they confirmed
               they had not seen Babu nor authorized him to be on campus. I

               tried calling Babu but I reached a message saying the
               subscriber was not currently taking phone calls. I could not
               leave a message. Adam Jussel believed Babu had left the area as
               his hearings had been done via phone and Chan thought Babu was
               living in Spokane. I emailed Sgt. Macy to see if dayshift could
               canvas the offices near Student Conduct for the Asian male and
               to show a picture of Babu. Case pending. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of

               and I were on patrol in the area of Kimbrough Hall, located at
               680 NE Library Rd. I pointed my spotlight on top of the roof,
               and I noticed a group of individuals standing on the northwest
               corner of the rooftop. Sgt. Griffin arrived on scene and
               watched the south access to the rooftop from the ground. Ofc.
               Boyd arrived on scene as backup officer. Cpl. Kuhrt, Ofc. Boyd,
               and I went to the rooftop to contact the individuals. Once I
               got to the top of the roof, I saw a male standing near the
               ladder who was later identified as Eric Oregon-Izazaga (DOB 11-
               16-95). While I spoke with Oregon-Izazaga, Cpl. Kuhrt and Ofc.
               Boyd went and looked for the other individuals. I asked Oregon-
               Izazaga what he was doing on the roof, and he told me just
               enjoying the view. I asked Oregon-Izazaga if he has been on top
               of the Kimbrough roof in the past, and he said one other time.
               I asked Oregon-Izazaga how they got on top of the roof, and he
               said they climbed up the south side of the building and used
               the ladder. I asked Oregon-Izazaga if he saw the no trespassing
               sign, and he said yes. Cpl. Kuhrt and Ofc. Boyd brought over
               the other six individuals who were on the rooftop with Oregon-
               Izazaga. The other six were identified as Benjamin D. Pierri
               (DOB 09-16-95), James M. Reyes (DOB 10-29-94), Erin E. Jacobsen
               (DOB 04-15-96), Isaac H. Williams (DOB 11-05-94), John D. Olson
               (DOB 08-18-94), and Jeffrey L. Bell (DOB 06-10-95). I asked all
               of them if they knew they should not be on the roof, and they
               all said yes. I asked if they had all seen the no trespassing
               sign, and a majority of them said yes. They all said this was
               their first time on the rooftop. I told all of them if they
               were found on the rooftop again they would be arrested for
               criminal trespassing. Five of the seven were WSU students. I
               told Oregon-Izazaga, Pierri, Reyes, Jacobsen, and Williams I
               would be notifying WSU Student Conduct. I told them to pick up

    Narrative: RVWD: 316 / OFC: DBT/321 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1952 SYNOPSIS: There was a window broken
               on the southwest corner of the ground floor of the Owen Science
               Library. WSU Facilities has been notified. No suspects or
               leads. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               04-24-15 at approximately 0457 hours I was dispatched to the
               report of a broken window on the southwest corner of the ground
               floor of the Owen Science Library, located at 1255 East College
               Ave. Dispatch advised WSU Facilities had been notified, and the
               custodian reporting the broken window was on scene for contact.
               I arrived on scene. I contacted the custodian, William E.
               Lawson (DOB 01-25-59). I asked Lawson when he noticed the
               broken window, and he said at about 0452 hours. Lawson told me
               he could hear a lot of noise and was wondering where it was
               coming from, and that is when he noticed the broken window. On
               04-23-15 at about 2330 hours I had been on foot patrol in the
               area of Owen Science Library, and the window had not been
               broken then. Lawson told me he thought it was strange he did
               not find a rock in the area. I checked the area, and I could
               not find a rock or any other object that may have been thrown
               through the window. A majority of the glass was on the inside
               of the library. I took photographs of the damage and they have
               been downloaded into Spillman. WSU Facilities arrived on scene
               and measured the window. The broken window was approximately
               six (6) feet wide and eight (8) feet high. I estimated the
               damage of the window to be $1,000.00. No further action. No
               suspects or leads at this time. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 24th day of
               April, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.
