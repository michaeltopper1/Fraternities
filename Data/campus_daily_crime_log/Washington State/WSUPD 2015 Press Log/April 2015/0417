               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1804 04/17/15 SYNOPSIS: Broken copy
               machine at Holland Library. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On April 17, 2015 at about 1002
               hours I was dispatched to a report of a broken copy machine at
               Holland Library. I contacted Kurt L. Albrecht (10/22/56) in
               person at the Cougar Copies office. Albrecht told me copy
               machine #3 was broken today sometime between 0730 and 0930.
               According to the machine's usage log the last time it was used
               was at about 0834 hours. Albrecht and I walked to Holland
               Library where the copy machine is located. It is on the main
               floor just to the west of the reference desk. There are other
               copy machines located in this area. None of the other machines
               had any damage. Machine #3 had a cracked display screen.
               Someone dropped or struck the display screen with an object
               cracking it. In addition there was a quarter sized black area
               where the display was not working. Albrecht estimates damage to
               be $900.00. There are no cameras in this area. Library staff
               did not see anyone damage the machine or causing any problems
               in the library this morning. The investigation continues. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 17th day of April, 2015, in Pullman,

               Microsoft Surface Pro 3 from Hulbert 111H. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On April 17, 2015 at
               about 1406 hours I was dispatched to Hulbert Hall room 101 for
               a report of a stolen tablet computer. I responded to the
               building where I contacted Associate Professor Jinhui Bai
               (03/29/76) and Alan Love, Director and Professor, WSU College
               of Agricultural, Human, and Natural Resource Sciences; School
               of Economic Sciences. The tablet was taken from Bai's office,
               Hulbert 111H. Bai told me he went to lunch at about 1200 hours
               today. He is fairly certain he shut and locked his office door.
               Bai returned at about 1330 hours. Shortly after returning he
               left his office for a cup of coffee in Lighty. Bai is not sure
               if he did not close the door or if he closed the door but
               didn't lock it. Sometime while he was gone at lunch or for
               coffee the Microsoft Surface Pro 3 tablet was taken from his
               desk. Someone entered his office 111H without permission,
               taking the tablet. Bai said the tablet was running on battery
               and plugged into the monitor with a video cable. The cable and
               tablet were taken. In addition someone had gone through his
               desk drawer and took the original Surface Pro 3 box that the
               tablet came in. Inside the box was a keyboard for the tablet.
               The power cable was not taken as it was on the desk in a black
               mesh bag. The wireless mouse and bluetooth keyboard on the desk
               were not taken. No other items were taken or disturbed in the
               office. I talked with some of the faculty in nearby offices.
               Nobody saw or heard anything suspicious. I checked Bai's door
               to see how well it closes and locks. The door easily closes and
               locks without much effort. There was no sign of forced entry.
               Entry can't be made through the windows. Bai's office is very
               close to the loading dock exit for Hulbert. Someone could have
               quickly exited the building without being noticed. Bai has no
               idea who may have taken the tablet or why they were in his
               office. His tablet is password protected and was set up by the
               CAHRNS IT Department. Bai regularly uses the tablet online via
               WIFI. I was given the WSU Property Inventory description from
               the SES Business Office. It has been added to the case. The
               computer is valued at $1551.00. The tablet was purchased on
               August 21, 2014. I filled out Teletype form for Stolen Property
               and gave it to WSU Records to be entered into NCIC. I notified
               WSU IT Security of the stolen item so it can be tracked and
               traced if ever on the WSU network. There are no suspects,
               witnesses, or leads at this time. No further investigation. I

               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 04-17-15 at
               approximately 1655 hours, I was advised of an anonymous caller
               reporting that for the last few months they had heard a dog
               whimpering in a room on the first floor of Rogers Hall and they
               were concerned the animal was being neglected. They stated they
               hear it all times during the day and night, but also to the
               dispatcher they don't live in the hall. The caller was a male
               and left no contact information. I responded and contacted Jena
               Dolittle, the RED for Rogers Hall. I advised her of the
               complaint. I could see her dog, Ginger, was in good condition
               and was not being neglected at all. Ginger was extremely
               friendly and active. Jena stated Ginger does have some
               separation anxiety, but wasn't very loud. I observed Jena is
               the only resident on the first floor and her residence is down
               the hall from the front desk area. Jena asked if there was
               anything she needed to do and I advised her I did not find the
               complaint to valid and it was unfounded as far animal neglect.
               I thanked her for her time and I cleared. Jena did mention she
               had some issues with some students in her hall and it is
               believed one of them may have called to try and get revenge for
               her doing her job as RED. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 18th day of April,

               NARRATIVE: On 041718 at approximately 1753 hours I was on a
               traffic stop on Stadium Way near the Shock Physics Bus Stop. I
               observed Chayden Z. Schmitz (112994) drive by on his
               motorcycle. He stood up on the pegs and removed his hands from
               the handle bars. He did this for several seconds. I noticed the
               bike wobbling. Traffic was heavy. He had vehicles to his front,
               back, and side. I cleared my stop and caught up to Schmitz at
               the East Main stop light. As he drove he still did not look
               like an experienced rider and his bike wobbled. I stopped
               Schmitz. He was curious as to what non-criminal violation he
               had committed. I informed him he had actually committed a
               crime. He stated he had ridden that way to impress girls and
               also thought it would be a benefit to do so in front of a
               Police Officer. I educated him on the law and let him go with a
               warning for Reckless Driving. I cleared, nothing follows. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of

               hours Cpl. Kuhrt and I were dispatched to the report of a theft

               Dispatch advised the complainant, Ashley A. Bass (DOB 06-10-
               91), was waiting at the SRC requesting contact. Cpl. Kuhrt and
               I arrived on scene. We contacted Bass who told us her phone was
               stolen from the Women's Locker Room in the SRC. Bass said her
               white, iPhone 5S was in a drawstring bag in the locker room on
               one of the benches, but not locked up. Bass said she went to go
               swimming at about 2000 hours, and when she returned to the
               locker room at about 2020 hours her phone was missing. Bass
               said there were other things of value in the drawstring bag
               that were not taken. I asked Bass if there were any
               distinguishing marks on her iPhone, and she said no. Bass also
               did not know the serial number. Bass estimated the value of her
               iPhone to be $700.00. Bass also said she had a grey and white
               hard plastic case on her iPhone. Bass estimated the value of
               the case to be $20.00. I told Bass to access her ICloud account
               and attempt to locate her phone and to lock it. I told Bass to
               contact me if she was able to use the locator option and find
               her phone. I told Bass we would try to access the video feed
               for the camera outside of the women's locker room. Bass' friend
               Chylah provided me her email address in case we were able to
               locate Bass's iPhone. Cpl. Kuhrt and I cleared the scene. Cpl.
               Kuhrt and I tried to pull up the video feed for the camera, but
               it was not working. I sent an email to Chylah telling her we
               were unable to access the video feed for the camera. No further
               suspects or leads at this time. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 18th day of

               Gillian M. Hawkins/06-09-96 Warned Minor Exhibiting 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 04-18-15 at approximately 0049 Cpl. Kuhrt and I
               were on patrol in the area of Spokane St, when I observed a
               female walking on the sidewalk of Spokane St. headed southbound
               towards Stadium Way. The female was walking slowly and having
               trouble keeping her balance. The female was swaying and unable
               to walk in a straight path. Cpl. Kuhrt and I contacted the
               female on Spokane St. near Stadium Way, who appeared to be
               under the age of 21. The female later identified herself as
               Gillian M. Hawkins (DOB 06-09-96). I asked Hawkins if she was
               21, and she told me no. I could smell the strong odor of
               intoxicants coming from Hawkins breath. When I asked Hawkins
               for her ID, she reached into her back pocket and then held out
               an empty palm with no ID. Hawkins was able to provide me with
               the information I needed from her verbally. Hawkins had slurred
               speech. When I asked Hawkins how much she had to drink, she
               told me way too much. I asked Hawkins if she would be willing
               to take a voluntary PBT, and she said yes. Hawkins blew a .199.
               Hawkins was able to answer simple questions and did not appear
               to be a danger to her self. Hawkins said her roommate was going
               to be with her in Stephenson East #1323. I told Hawkins if she
               was seen outside again tonight, she would be subject to arrest
               for Minor Exhibiting the Effects of Alcohol in Public. Hawkins
               said she understood. Cpl. Kuhrt and I cleared the scene. No
               further action. My Vievu camera was activated, and the video
               has been downloaded into the permanent digital evidence folder.
               I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws
               of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 18th day of April, 2015, in Pullman,

               were stopped on Thatuna Rd. at Colorado St. when I noticed a
               female who was walking eastbound along Colorado St. The female,
               later identified as Kassandra S. Strickland (061896), caught my
               attention because she appeared to be under 21 and was stumbling
               as she walked. I contacted Strickland as she reached the lower
               K house parking lot. I asked Strickland where she was going and
               she said Northside with some friends. Strickland spoke with
               slurred speech. I asked if she had any ID with her and she did
               not. She provided her name and date of birth, which were
               confirmed through Dispatch. The information provided confirmed
               she was under 21. I asked how much she had to drink and she
               could not tell me exactly. She said she had been drinking mixed
               drinks. I asked if I could check her eyes so I could see how
               much she had to drink and she agreed. I administered a
               horizontal gaze nystagmus test on her. I observed she had
               bloodshot and watery eyes, a lack of smooth pursuit, and a
               distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation. I could
               smell the odor of intoxicants on her breath as I administered
               the test. I asked if she would provide a breath sample on a PBT
               and she agreed. She provided a sample of .181 on alco sensor
               FST #5493. Strickland told me she had been arrested for MIP on
               a previous occasion. I advised her she was under arrest for MIP
               Exhibiting and placed her in handcuffs double locked. I placed
               her in the back of my patrol car while I completed a citation.
               After starting the infraction I realized I had not read her her
               constitutional rights so I stopped and did so. I issued
               Strickland citation #5Z0481853 for MIP Exhibiting. I explained
               in citation to her, she received her copy, and was released.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 18 day of April, 2015, in
               Pullman, Washington. _______________________________________

               sometime overnight. Someone had used a black dry erase marker
               to write on the mirror in the restroom. They wrote "Mohammad
               middle east faggot". I photographed the graffiti. I observed
               the custodian clean the graffiti from the mirror. I checked the
               restroom for any other graffiti. There was no more to be found
               in the restroom. Damage is estimated at $25.00. There are no
