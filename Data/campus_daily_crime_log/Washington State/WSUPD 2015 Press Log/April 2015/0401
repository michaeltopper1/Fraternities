               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1507 SYNOPSIS: WSU Catering Services
               reported that sometime over the weekend, someone hit their
               catering van. No suspects or leads. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 040115 at approximately 1018
               hours, I was dispatched to a report of a hit and run collision
               report at WSU Catering. Upon arrival, I contacted Gary Thoren
               who told me the following. On 032715 at approximately 1700
               hours, he left work and there was no damage to their 2001 Dodge
               Caravan catering van. On 033015 at approximately 0800 hours,
               they returned to work and noticed there was damage to the front
               driver's side fender which pushed on the door jamb making it
               difficult to open the driver's door. Thoren told me that there
               were several catering events that occurred on campus over the
               weekend and none of his student managers reported the damage to
               him from the weekend. Thoren told me he is unsure when or where
               the damage occurred to the car. Thoren told me he was going to
               talk to all his catering staff that worked over the weekend to
               narrow down the time frame and location of the damage. I
               checked the damage to the car and noticed that there were blue
               paint transfer marks, denting and tire rub marks on the front
               driver's side bumper and quarter panel. The quarter panel was
               also pushed into the frame of the door which when the door was
               opened caused the quarter panel at the edge of the door to bend
               to give way to opening the door. I took photographs of the
               damage and estimated approximately $1500 to repair the vehicle.
               No suspects at this time. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 2nd day of April,
               2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               from someone claiming to be from a collection agency stating
               she owed them some money. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR#
               1. 2. NARRATIVE: Reyna Ponce Flores said a man claiming to be
               from the collection company, Kay and Legal Services, saying she
               owed them $1800. The man, known as Anthony, said Reyna owed the
               $1800 due to an over draft at Wells Fargo Bank. Reyna hasn't
               had an account with Wells Fargo for over four years. Reyna said
               she contacted Wells Fargo and said they have no claims against
               her. Reyna also said she contacted Kay and Legal Services who
               said they no collection actions assigned to her name. The call
               she received from Anthony last Monday, 3/30/15, showed a phone
               number of 844-230-0296. Anthony told Reyna when she had the
               money and was ready to pay to call his at this number, 213-286-
               0704. Anthony also told Reyna if she did not come up with the
               $1800 soon they would take her to court where it could cost her
               5 to 6 thousand dollars. Anthony did tell Reyna her case number
               was 2014-27486. I told Reyna she had taken the correct steps in
               contacting Wells Fargo and the collection agency. I suggested
               Reyna block those numbers from her phone so it would be more
               difficult for them to contact her. I told Reyna I would attempt
               to call those two number to see if I could learn anything, but
               the odds are I would not be able to do anything at this time. I
               asked Reyna to contact me if Anthony contacts her again. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this ____ day of _____________, 2015, in

               making a left turn onto Grimes Way leaving the Food Services
               parking lot. Grimes Way is a two way street that has two (2)
               lanes of traffic. Grillo was making a left turn, when his
               Toyota (WA Lic. #C78660C) struck the Subaru (ID Lic. #1LB0840),
               driven by Tom W. Mcreynolds (DOB 07-12-55). Grillo said he
               thought it was clear, but he just did not see the Subaru.
               Grillo told me he tagged the rear driver's side quarter panel
               of Mcreynolds' Subaru. Grillo told me both vehicles were
               traveling at a slow rate of speed. Mcreynolds told me he was
               traveling eastbound on Grimes Way when he felt his Subaru being
               pushed by the Toyota. The blacktop was dry, and it was sunny
               out. Digital photos were taken of the damaged vehicles and the
               scene, and have been downloaded to Spillman. I exchanged
               information between drivers. Neither vehicle needed a tow. I
               verbally warned Grillo for failure to yield. No infractions or
               citations were issued. No further investigation. Sector PTCR
               has been completed. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 1st day of March,
               2014 in Pullman, Washington.
