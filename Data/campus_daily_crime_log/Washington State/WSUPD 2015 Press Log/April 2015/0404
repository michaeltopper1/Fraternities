               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1580 SYNOPSIS: Perkins contacted for
               smoking his "medical marijuana" in his car at the observatory.
               The case will be referred to student conduct. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Eric J. Perkins 01/10/96 Warned Poss.
               of Marijuana 2. NARRATIVE: On 04/04/15 at approximately 2226
               hours I was driving through the Observatory parking lot and I
               came across a Saturn sedan parked with a male in the driver's
               seat. Knowing the area of the Observatory is a known drug usage
               area I decided to contact the occupant of the car. As I walked
               up to the car the driver, Eric James Perkins 01/10/96 began to
               roll up his window which I found odd. As I reached the driver's
               side door, Perkins opened the door. As Perkins opened the door
               I could smell the odor of marijuana coming from within the car.
               I asked Perkins what brought him to the Observatory. Perkins
               said he lives in Rogers Hall and so he parks there since it is
               a blue parking area. I pointed out the large blue parking lot
               right next to his dorm. Perkins who has lived in Rogers for 8
               months acted as if this was new news to him. I asked for
               Perkins ID which he provided. I asked told Perkins why I was
               contacting him and asked him if he had a medical marijuana
               card. Perkins said he had just got his medical marijuana
               authorization today in Spokane. Perkins provided me with his
               authorization paperwork. Perkins paperwork appeared to be
               authentic. I asked Perkins if he would show me how much
               marijuana he had so I could confirm he was within his legal
               limits. Perkins opened a vacuum seal container that had
               approximately 3 grams of fresh marijuana and he also had one
               gram of marijuana concentrate (Dabs). I told Perkins about the
               DUI laws regarding marijuana as well as the University's
               policies. Perkins said he had planned on walking home and not
               driving. I told Perkins that even though he has a medical
               marijuana authorization he was still violating the Universities
               policies and would be referred to student conduct. Perkins
               stated he understood. I left Perkins so he could continue to
               ingest his "medication." END OF REPORT I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               Tiengo arrived on scene. I briefed Tiengo on the cirumstances
               and asked if he wanted to contact the driver regarding the odor
               of marijuana, which he did. Sullivan denied having marijuana in
               the car and did not appear to be under the influence of
               marijuana. Each passenger was then talked to, individually,
               outside the car. They were all identified as; Byron S. Howell
               Jr, Brandon W. Fogg, Quincee T.M. Greenwood and Imani I. Kemp.
               Each occupant stated that they had not smoked marijuana and
               advised that they did not have any marijuana with them. Officer
               Tiengo then asked Sullivan for permission to search her car,
               which she granted. He advised her of her Ferrier warnings
               before beginning the search. Nothing of evidentiary value was
               found in the car. They were all told they were free to leave. I
               thanked Sullivan for her cooperation and told her that I was
               giving her a warning for running the red light. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 5th day of April, 2015, in Pullman,

               the room. I knocked on the door of #430 and when it was opened
               there were two occupants in the room. The two males inside the

               marijuana. Pascoe admitted he let Avramenko smoke his medicinal

               in the dorms and he is not allowed to distribute his medicinal
               marijuana. Pascoe and Avramenko were advised their names would

               Arrested/Booked Assault 4th DV Unlawful Imprisonment NARRATIVE:
               On 04/05/15 at approximately 0052 hours I was on foot a the
               Compton Union Building (CUB) as a dance was going on in the
               senior ballroom. I was walking out the front doors on the
               southside of the CUB when I could hear a male's voice yelling
               something to the effect of, "who is he are you going to fuck
               him?" I noticed a male and female sitting on a bench to my
               right and the male was yelling very aggressively towards the
               female. I walked up to the two who were later identified as
               Juan Jose Castillo Cisneros 02/21/91 and Andreina Olguin
               07/10/91. I told Juan and Andreina that if they continued to
               argue outside they were going to draw the attention from the
               Police. Juan was instantly argumentative and aggressive. Juan
               started to rant about how he knows his rights and I had nothing
               on him so I needed to leave. I told Juan that he needed to stop
               yelling at people and I would be keeping my eye on him. Juan
               was still argumentative and aggressive by challenging me to do
               something. Seeing that this contact was not going to go
               anywhere positive I walked away. I continued my foot patrol
               around the exterior of the CUB. At approximately 0101 hours
               Cougar Security Units requested an Officer to respond to the
               front of the CUB. I was already near the front of the CUB and
               saw Juan yelling at Andreina near the front doors of the CUB.
               While walking towards the two I watched as Andreina start to
               walk towards the front doors and then Juan grab Andreina by her
               bicep, pulled her back towards him. Andreina ripped her arm
               away from Juan and again started to walk away. Juan again
               grabbed Andreina by the bicep. Andreina sat down on a bench as
               Juan stood in front of her. It was clear Juan was purposefully
               preventing Andreina from walking where she wanted to go. I was
               still to far away to hear what Juan and Andreina were saying.
               Knowing that Juan was going to be aggressive and most likely
               uncooperative I requested more Officers who were already
               nearby. As I reached Juan I told him to put his hand up and he
               did not do so. I told Juan he was being detained and grabbed
               his left wrist and bicep. I told Juan to put his hands behind
               his back. I felt as Juan tensed his arm in attempt to overcome
               my control of him. I again told Juan to put his hands behind
               his back but Juan kept tying to move his arm towards his
               stomach. I bent Juan over using an armbar technique as another

               Officer grabbed Juan's right arm. During the struggle my VieVu
               camera turned off. I continued to tell Juan to put his hands
               behind his back but Juan was still resisting our control. Juan
               was bent over a large concrete bench and still using his feet
               to push away from us. I was able to push Juan off the bench and
               onto the ground. Once on the ground I was able to get Juan's
               left arm behind his back and into a gooseneck hold. Juan was
               keeping his right arm under his chest as Cpl. Daniels and
               Intern Bonjukian attempted to get control of his arm. Around
               this time I saw my VieVu camera was off so I turned it back on.
               After several seconds of fighting with Juan, Intern Bonjukian
               was able to get Juan's right arm behind his back. Cpl. Daniels
               handcuffed Juan. Once handcuffed I frisked Juan for weapons and
               found none. I read Juan his Miranda Rights of my department
               issued card. Juan stated he understood his rights. Juan
               continued to be argumentative and refusing to listen. I asked
               Juan what he wanted to say since he had been yelling that he
               did nothing wrong. Juan did not have anything to say. Juan
               finally asked what he did wrong and I explained what I watched
               happen. I asked Juan about what was going on and Juan began to
               complain about his handcuffs being too tight. Cpl. Daniels had
               already checked his handcuffs but I did again to appease Juan.
               I could fit a finger in between the handcuff and his wrist. The
               handcuffs were correctly applied to Juan. Juan kept telling me
               that I had to loosen the handcuffs and I kept telling him no. I
               again asked Juan what was going on and Juan said he did nothing
               wrong so I needed to loosen the handcuffs. Juan then
               threatened, "you either loosen them (handcuffs) up or I'll sue
               you, you are equal to me." Juan asked what my name was and I
               told him I was Officer Westerman and my badge number was 325. I
               asked Juan why he put his hands on Andreina. Juan said talk to
               her (Andreina). Juan was not making rational sense when he
               spoke. I could smell the odor of intoxicants coming from his
               breath. Juan's eyes were bloodshot and watery. I believed Juan
               to be under the influence of alcohol. It was clear that Juan
               was not going to cooperate with my investigation so I told Juan
               that he was under arrest for assault and unlawful imprisonment.
               I stood Juan up and walked him to my patrol car which was
               parked in front of the Police Station. When I stood Juan up it
               caused my camera to turn off. After a few feet of walking I
               noticed my camera was off and I turned it on again. While
               walking to my patrol car, Juan kept saying he did nothing wrong
               over and over. Once at my patrol car I searched Juan incident
               to arrest and removed the following items from his clothing: -
               WADL belonging to Juan -WADL belonging to Andreina -Movie
               ticket stub -Gesa debit card -lip gloss I was told that
               Andreina was requesting her lip gloss and ID back and they were
               returned to her. I placed Juan in the backseat of my patrol car
               and informed him he was being audio and video recorded as well
               as his Miranda Rights were still in effect. I asked Juan how
               long he and Andreina had been dating and Juan said a year and a
               half. Juan appeared to be more calm so I again told him what I
               had observed as I walked up on he and Andreina. Juan said that
               they both had agreed to take a breather before going back
               inside and that's when they sat down. I asked Juan what his

               intention was by not letting Andreina walk away. Juan said, "I
               did not want her to stay outside." I told Juan it looked as if
               Andreina was trying to walk inside and Juan said no she was
               just trying to walk away. I told Juan that he was being charged
               with assault 4th degree domestic violence and unlawful
               imprisonment. I met up with Ofc. Boyd who had interviewed
               Andreina. Ofc. Boyd stated that at first Andreina was being
               evasive in her answers and did not want to cooperate. Through
               the interview Andreina Ofc. Boyd determined that Andreina had
               wanted to go back inside to the dance and Juan wanted her to
               leave with him. Andreina admitted to Juan pulling on her. See
               Ofc. Boyd's supplemental for further details. I transported
               Juan to the Pullman Holding Facility and I placed him in a
               holding cell. A while later I returned and transported Juan to
               Whitman County Jail where he was booked in on his charges.
               Charges of Assault 4th Degree Domestic Violence and Unlawful
               Imprisonment will be forwarded to the Prosecutor. END OF

               04/05/15 at approximately 0145 I arrived at the CUB to assist
               with the event in the senior ballroom. When I reached the front
               doors I found several people standing outside trying to get in
               as if the doors were locked. When I reached the doors one male,
               later identified as Sergio Baez 05/27/96, asked why they were
               locked when the event was supposed to go to 0200 hours. I told
               Baez I did not know but we would go find out. I swiped into the
               building with my cougar card and we asked Sgt. Griffin about
               the doors. Sgt. Griffin told Baez that if you exit the building
               you were not allowed back in. I told Baez that he would have to
               leave the building. Baez said he understood and walked outside.
               About five minutes later I saw Baez walking back into the
               building. I asked Baez what he was doing and Baez said he had a
               hangnail that was bleeding. I could see a large amount of blood
               coming from Baez's right hand pinky finger. I handed Baez a
               bandaid and pointed him to the bathroom. I told Baez he needed
               to leave the building once he was done. About five minutes
               later I saw Baez trying to sneak upstairs to the event. I told
               Baez to stop but he ignored me. I caught up to Baez and grabbed
               his left arm of his jacket. I told Baez that he was being
               detained and was being escorted from the building. I walked
               Baez outside and had him sit down on a bench. I told Baez that
               he was being trespassed from the CUB for 24 hours and if he was
               found in the building again he would be arrested for
               trespassing. Baez said he understood. I told Baez he was free
               to go and suggested he go home. END OF REPORT I certify and

               dispatched to a malicious mischief call at the Northside
               Residence Hall. I arrived and talked to the second floor RA
               Sarah Cundiff. The damage was in the second floor men's
               bathroom. Two paper towel dispensers and a soap dispenser had
               been torn off the wall. I photographed the damage to the
               bathroom. Hall staff had placed the items torn off the wall in
               an office. Cundiff showed me the dispensers. The two paper
               towel dispenser appeared to be unbroken just removed from the
               wall. The soap dispenser had the cover ripped off and the soap
               was missing from inside. I photographed the dispensers. Cundiff
               said she did not know who vandalized the bathroom, but she did
               have contact with two residents of the second floor earlier in
               the night and they were upset. Cundiff said she contacted
               Kingston Y. Fernandez (072296) and William G. Hoyd III (092195)
               at their room, room 226. They were warned for noise and alcohol
               use. Cundiff said Fernandez and Hoyd were upset about getting
               in trouble and she thought they may have caused the damage. On
               04/05/15 at about 2150 I talked to Hoyd and Fernandez at
               Northside Residence Hall room 226. I asked them about what
               happened last night. They said they had gotten in trouble for
               being loud and having alcohol. I asked them if they knew what
               happened in the bathroom. They said they did not know anything
               about what happened. I asked if they knew anything about the
               damage to the bathroom and they said they did not. I asked them
               if they caused the damage in the bathroom because they were
               upset about last night, they said they did not. No suspects, no
               leads. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the

               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               04/05/15 at about 0534 hours Pullman PD requested officers to
               assist in locating individuals that fled from the scene of a
               domestic dispute in the 500 block of Maiden Ln. Corporal
               Edwards and I responded to the area. Pullman PD notified us
               they no longer needed our assistance because they were unable
               to get identities or clothing descriptions for the individuals.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 5th day of April, 2015, in
               Pullman, Washington. _______________________________________
