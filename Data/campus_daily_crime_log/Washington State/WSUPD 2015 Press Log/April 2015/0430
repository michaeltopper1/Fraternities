               at approximately 0724 hours, I was dispatched to a report of a
               hit and run of a light pole behind Wilson Road. Upon arrival, I
               noticed a light pole that was leaning and broken from it's
               base. I took photographs of the damaged light pole and added
               them to the case. I returned to WSUPD and contacted Debbie at
               facilities who was unable to give me any further information
               regarding a time frame when the damage occurred. I estimated
               the damage to the pole at approximately $500.00 Debbie
               forwarded my call to the WSU Facilities Electricians office
               where I left a message for them to return my phone call.
               Investigation continues. I certify and declare under penalty of

               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Kahlil R. Stanley (040292)
               Contacted Welfare Check 2. NARRATIVE: On 043015 at
               approximately 0920 hours, I was dispatched to a report of a
               welfare check in Perham Hall room 639. Upon arrival, I
               contacted Nicholas North, RED for Streit/Perham Hall, who told
               me the following. He told me that Kahlil R. Stanley has had
               suicidal tendencies in the past and that he contacted OEO
               regarding a meeting he had scheduled with them today and
               cancelled. OEO contacted North and asked him to check on
               Stanley. When North went to Stanley's room and knocked on the
               door, Stanley locked the door and didn't answer. North became
               concerned for Stanley's safety because in his email he stated
               he didn't want to meet because "it wasn't worth it anymore." I
               knocked on the door to Stanley's room and announced who I was.
               Stanley came to the door and began recording the contact.
               Stanley answered the door with the security chain reinforcing
               the door. He asked if I had a warrant and I told him that I did
               not. I asked him if we could talk about the situation and he
               initially told me he didn't want to. I explained why I was
               there and he opened the door and said I could come in. I asked
               Stanley if he knew why we were there and he told me he did. I
               asked him how everything was going and he told me it was fine.
               I asked him how his classes were going and he told me they were
               actually great. I asked him if he was feeling stressed with
               finals coming up and he told me he was. I asked him why he
               cancelled his meeting with OEO and he told me he didn't feel
               meeting with them was worth his time. He stated he was
               preparing to go to class, but he didn't have any intention of
               meeting with OEO. I asked him if he was having suicidal
               thoughts and he told me he wasn't. I asked him if he has seen a
               counselor and he told me that he can't ever get an appointment
               with them. I asked him if he wanted assistance arranging a
               meeting with them and he told me he didn't. Based on my contact
               with Stanley, I got the impression that he knew all the right
               things to say and he knew what information I needed for
               protective custody. After talking with Stanley, Sgt. Macy and I
               agreed that he didn't meet the Involuntary Treatment Act
               requirements for Protective Custody. I gave Stanley my business
               card and he told me he had no intention of calling me. I left
               it on his desk and cleared. Nothing further. I certify and

               hours, I was dispatched to a Fraud report. Upon contact, Emily
               K. Amos told me the following. Approximately a week ago, she
               was looking for a job, and she applied for an online job at
               www.care.com. Amos stated she received an email from a person
               named Mark Brus who told her he would send her a check and then
               have her moneygram $2500 of the check to him and she could keep
               the change for her hassle. When Amos received the check, she
               became suspicious and looked into the check. She noticed it was
               most likely a scam and reported the incident. I asked Amos if
               she had the check and she told me she did and didn't know what
               to do with it. I told her she could give it to me and I would
               destroy it. She gave me the check, I photographed the check and
               placed shredded it in the WSUPD shredder. Case closed. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: mjp/327 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE

               Marijuana 2. Dylan S. Santos (112795) NARRATIVE: On 043015 at
               approximately 2000 hours I was dispatched to the odor of
               marijuana coming from room 327 in Stimson Hall. The room did
               not have previous contact noted in Spillman. I responded and
               met with RED Alrashoodi. She said the door had opened and 3
               males had left. The odor of marijuana was strong when the door
               opened. I could smell the odor and knocked on the door. Aaron
               M. Schwam (010696) answered and appeared very nervous. I could
               see his carotid artery pulsing and he was quite pale. He
               allowed me to come in. I spoke with him and a roommate, Dylan
               S. Santos (112795). They have another roommate who was not
               there who Alrashoodi was going to follow up on. I could smell
               the odor of marijuana throughout the communal area. They denied
               any knowledge of the smoking activity, though Schwam admitted
               to smoking a few days prior. I told them to retrieve anything
               they should not have to include paraphernalia. Schwam got 2
               glass pipes and disposed of them outside. Though Santos appears
               to be less involved we discussed his responsibility to report
               or get out of the situation that he would obviously been aware
               of. I cleared. Nothing follows. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 30th day of
               April, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 043015 at approximately 2000
               hours I was dispatched to a marijuana call in Stimson Hall (15-
               W2117). I met with RED Alrashoodi who told me she had been on
               the floor for another issue involving a possibly suicidal
               student. She went to go speak with the student, Bailey D.
               Brindle (071895), while I finished up with the marijuana call.
               I then went to Brindle's room and he let me in to speak with
               him and Alrashoodi. He confirmed that he had threatened to kill
               himself the night before by jumping off Terrell Library but
               figured he would have more likely suffered significant trauma
               but not death. His threat had made some friends mad at him and
               he was stressing about his grades. He had just returned from
               another test in which he did not do well. Brindle confirmed
               that he had thought about killing himself a month before by
               hanging himself with a sheet. He had given the sheet to his
               counselor who has been seeing. He had missed this weeks
               appointment with her and his next appointment was not until May
               5th. Brindle stated he was on medication and currently
               following the prescription. I explained our options and he
               agreed to go voluntarily to PRH. I transported him to PRH, then
               later retrieved him, and returned him to Stimson Hall. Nothing
               follows. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 1st day of May, 2015, in Pullman,

               2058 hours, I was on foot on the south side of Smith Gym when I
               observed a female laying on the ground. I could also smell an
               odor of marijuana and observed the female was smoking a joint.
               She was barely able to sit up as she was extremely stoned. I
               asked her to put it out and to provide her identification. She
               went through her purse twice and then stared at me. She took
               another puff of the joint. I again told her to put out the
               joint and she did. I told her to find her license and she was
               identified as Emily C. Altobelli. I asked her why she was
               smoking marijuana in public and she stated she didn't have a
               good reason. She was having difficulty sitting up straight. Her
               friend, who I did not identify, stated she would help her home.
               I issued Emily a verbal warning for smoking marijuana in a
               public place and advised her I would be forwarding the incident
               to Student Conduct. She stated she understood. Her friend
               helped her get it up and they walked away. I cleared. I certify

               hours Cpl. Kuhrt and I were dispatched to the report of found
               graffiti in the exterior stairwell of Goldsworthy Hall, located
               at 1457 SE Stadium Way. Dispatch advised the complainant,
               Rachel B. Swassord (DOB 10-27-95), was on scene for contact.
               Cpl. Kuhrt and I arrived on scene. I contacted Swassord near
               the west exterior stairwell of Goldsworthy Hall, near Kruegel
               Hall. Swassord told me she is one of the Resident Advisor's on
               duty. Swassord showed me the graffiti inside the stairwell.
               Most of the north wall was covered in green, black, and red
               spray paint. The spray paint read, "counter their suppression".
               The west wall had black spray paint on it, which read "foe".
               Also, under the stairs it looked like someone used a black
               marker and drew a penis, along with the letters "GHS", and few
               other various symbols. I took photographs of the damage, and
               they have been downloaded into Spillman. I estimated the total
               damage of the spray paint to be $75.00. Swassord told me she
               noticed the spray paint at about 2120 hours on 04-30-15, and
               that an RA last checked the area probably around 2330 hours on
               04-29-15. Swassord told me she has no idea who may have done
               the spray painting. Cpl. Kuhrt and I cleared the scene. I
               request a copy of my report be sent to WSU Facilities. No
               suspects or leads at this time. My Vievu camera was activated,
               and the video has been downloaded into the permanent digital

               assistance contacting a room for a noise complaint and possible
               alcohol offense. We attempted contact with residents of the
               room but were unsuccessful. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 04/30/15 at about 2155 hrs
               Dispatch advised hall staff at Northside Hall was requesting
               officers respond to assist in contacting a room for a noise
               complaint. I responded and contacted the complainant, Colby B.
               Cavanaugh (060794), who advised they contacted the residents of
               room 344 earlier in the night for noise and discovered they had
               been drinking. They dealt with the problem at that time but the
               subjects involved were very disrespectful and verbally
               uncooperative. Later they could hear loud music and suspected
               drinking was occurring in the room again. Due to the conflict
               at the previous contact Cavanaugh thought it would be best if
               we assisted in contacting the subjects a second time. He
               thought several of them had already left the room, as the music
               had been turned off. I went to the door at 344 and could hear
               some music inside but it was not unreasonably loud. I knocked
               on the door several times but received no answer and heard
               nothing to indicate anyone was actually in the room. Cavanaugh
               thanked us for trying and I told him to feel free and call
               again should the problem return later in the night. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 01 day of May, 2015, in Pullman,

               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 04-30-15 at
               approximately 2312 hours I was dispatched to a welfare check
               for a possible suicidal subject. Dispatch advised the
               complainant, Brooke A. Regier (DOB 04-24-96), was receiving
               suicidal texts from her friend Zachary J. Perry (DOB 01-08-96).
               Dispatch advised Perry lives in Stephenson East #625, but his
               friend is unsure of his current location. Cpl. Daniels and I
               arrived on scene. I knocked on room #625, and eventually a male
               in his underwear answered the door. The male later identified
               himself as Zachary J. Perry (DOB 01-08-96) by his driver's
               license. I asked Perry if he knew why we were there, and he
               said no. I told Perry one of his friend's was concerned about
               his well being because some of the texts he sent earlier. I
               asked Perry if he was thinking about killing himself, and he
               told me no. Perry told me he is just stressed out about his
               classes. I asked Perry if he was seeing a counselor or on any
               medications, and he said no to both. Cpl. Daniels asked Perry
               if he had been drinking, and he said yes. Cpl. Daniels asked
               Perry if he had smoked any marijuana, and he said no. Perry
               told us he does smoke marijuana on occasion though. Cpl.
               Daniels told him the alcohol was probably not helping his
               depression and Perry agreed. Cpl. Daniels suggested he go talk
               to his professor's about his classes. I provided Perry with the
               WSU Counseling Services phone number, as well as the 24-hour
               Crisis Hotline number. Cpl. Daniels asked Perry if we could see
               the text messages he sent, and he brought us his phone. Cpl.
               Daniels went through the texts and found one that talked about
               wanting to kill himself. Cpl. Daniels asked him if he had a
               plan on how he would kill himself, and Perry said no. Cpl.
               Daniels told Perry he could voluntarily be transported to
               Pullman Regional Hospital or we would have to take him into
               protective custody. Perry said he would go to the hospital
               voluntarily. I frisked Perry for any weapons before placing him
               in the back of my patrol vehicle. I transported Perry to
               Pullman Regional Hospital for a Mental Health Professional
               Evaluation. I told Perry he could give us a call when he was
               done and we would pick him up. I later picked Perry up from
               Pullman Regional Hospital. I transported Perry back to
               Stephenson East. No further action. My Vievu camera was

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2125 SYNOPSIS: Subject was arrested,
               cited, and released for operating a motor vehicle without an
               interlock device. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.

               5Z0481854 2. NARRATIVE: On 05/01/15 at about 0000 hrs I was
               stopped on Stadium Way at Valley Rd. facing northbound for a
               stop light when I saw a vehicle, (WA APY4484), make a left hand
               turn from B St. northbound on to Stadium Way. The vehicle
               caught my attention because there were two pedestrians crossing
               the street from B St toward Valley Rd. The vehicle cut in front
               of both pedestrians, who were in the left hand (inside)
               northbound lane on Stadium Way, turning into the right hand
               (outside) northbound lane on Stadium Way. The pedestrians
               stopped in the roadway because of the vehicle driving in front
               of them. They were approximately 2 ft from the white dashed
               line dividing the northbound lanes. I caught up to the vehicle
               and initiated a traffic stop, turning on my overhead lights.
               The vehicle stopped in the McDonalds parking lot. I contacted
               the driver, Sovannary S. Ouk (021888), and told her the reason
               for the stop and the stop was being recorded. I asked Ouk for
               her driver's license, vehicle registration, and proof of
               insurance. She told me she did not have a driver's license. I
               asked if she did not have her license with her or if she was
               saying she did not have a license at all. She told me her
               license was suspended. She provided me with a temporary ID
               card. She could not locate the registration and insurance for
               the vehicle as it belonged to a friend. She told me she was
               making a run for food for her friends who were working late for
               school. She said she knew she should not have been driving. I
               ran Ouk through Dispatch and they advised that her driving
               status was clear in Washington but she had a restriction
               requiring the use of an ignition interlock device. I returned
               to the vehicle and told Ouk her license was current but that
               she was required to drive a vehicle with an interlock
               installed. I told her I assumed since it was her friends
               vehicle there was no interlock installed and she said that was
               correct. I had Ouk step from the vehicle and placed her in
               handcuffs (double locked). I reminded her she was being
               recorded. Corporal Daniels searched Ouk and placed her in the
               back of my patrol vehicle. I read Ouk her Constitutional Rights
               from a pre-printed card and she said she understood them. I
               explained to her I would be issuing her a citation and she
               would be released shortly. As I was completing the citation one

               of Ouk's friends, Madison P. Lyons (090794), who happened to be
               in the area and saw what was going on approached. She said she
               was on the phone with the owner of the vehicle and wanted to
               know if someone could come get the dogs that were in the
               vehicle. I told her if there was someone who could come drive
               the vehicle once Ouk was released that would be best. Lyons
               said she could drive the vehicle. Ouk confirmed she knew Lyons.
               I issued Ouk criminal citation #5Z0481854 for an ignition
               interlock violation. I explained the citation to her, she
               received her copy, and was released. Nothing further. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2126 SYNOPSIS: Six subjects were
               contacted in the Zen Stairwell of the Fine Arts Parking Garage.
               They were all warned for spray painting in the stairwell.

               01-15 at approximately 0037 hours I was on patrol in the Fine
               Arts Parking Garage, located at 1615 NE Wilson Road. I could
               smell the odor of burnt marijuana emitting from the door to the
               Zen Stairwell. Ofc. Boyd arrived on scene as backup officer. I
               opened the door to the Zen Stairwell and I could hear voices
               inside. I contacted a group of six subjects who were later
               identified as Samuel R. Harris (DOB 08-10-96), Jocelyn Camacho
               (DOB 01-10-96), Colton C. Hall (DOB 02-13-96), Mariela Castro

               Kurtz (DOB 06-06-96). I had all of them exit the stairwell due
               to the strong odor of the fumes. Once we got out of the
               stairwell I could not smell the odor of marijuana emitting from
               any of them. I asked them what they were doing, and they told
               me they were about to spray paint. Hall had a plastic bag with
               him containing multiple cans of spray paint. I asked them if
               this was their first time in the Zen Stairwell to spray paint,
               and they all said yes. I asked them if they knew they were not
               allowed to spray paint in the stairwell, and they all said no.
               I told all of them if they were found spray painting in the Zen
               Stairwell in the future, they could be arrested for malicious
               mischief. They all told me they understood. Ofc. Boyd and I
               cleared the scene. No further action. My Vievu camera was
               activated, and the video has been downloaded into the permanent
