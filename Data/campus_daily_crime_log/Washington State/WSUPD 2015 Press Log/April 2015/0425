               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On April 25, 2015
               I was dispatched to Goldsworthy Hall for a broken window in the
               4th floor stairwell door. I responded to the building at about
               0906 hours. I contacted the complainant at the west 4th floor
               stairwell door. Someone had broken out the small safety glass
               window located in the middle of the door. The window is about
               12 inches square. I estimate the damage at $250.00. I
               photographed the damage. The complainant said the damage
               occurred between 0200 hours and 0837 hours when he reported it.
               We checked the public areas on the 4th floor, no additional
               damage was found. I checked the six (6) west stairwell doors.
               Only the 4th floor had damage. There are no suspects,
               witnesses, or leads at this time. No further investigation. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of

               Adams (04/07/95). They were using scrap wood to build a
               "lookout" at the top of the hill. They did not have permission
               to erect a lookout or any permits. They apologized and began to
               pick up the wood they had placed on the ground. There was no
               damage to WSU property. There are no signs prohibiting people
               from driving up the steep gravel road to the top of the hill.
               There is a gate at the bottom of the hill that has been lying
               in brush off it's hinges for many years. There was no actual
               trespassing. Both males were counseled. No infractions,

               though he had just heard "Shots fired" from a handgun. Lowney
               was on the 3rd floor of Waller Hall and he said he thought the

               a better idea what he heard. He again described the noise as
               one shot followed quickly by two quick shots. I asked him if
               there was a possibility of it being the starter pistol being
               used at the WSU track meet and he said it was quite possible.
               Officer Jones and I saw several groups walking in the general
               area of Stimson and Waller Hall. No one seemed alarmed and no
               one reported hearing the "Shots fired". We cleared without
               further action being required. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 25th day of

               Cite/Release MIP Exhibiting C7822 2. NARRATIVE: On 04/25/15 at
               about 1916 hrs I was working at Beasley Coliseum for the
               2Chainz concert when I noticed a male, later identified as Sean
               A. Leboeuf (080894), who was walking in the outer concourse. He
               appeared to be under the age of 21 and was stumbling as he
               walked. I observed as he walked into the coliseum and walked
               down to the railing at the bottom of the upper level of the
               seating. He walked in front of two rows of people and then
               began walking up another set of stairs toward the inner
               concourse. At one point he had to grab the railing because it
               appeared he might fall backward down the stairs. I contacted
               him on the stairs and escorted him to the inner concourse. I
               asked how much he had to drink and he said he had several
               beers. I could smell a strong odor of intoxicants on his breath
               as I spoke with him and noticed he spoke with slurred speech. I
               asked if I could check his eyes and he refused. I asked him for
               ID and he provided a CA driver's license that confirmed he was
               under 21. Officer Westerman ran him and I advised Leboeuf he
               was under arrest for MIP Exhibiting and placed him in handcuffs
               (double locked). As I was searching Leboeuf Officer Westerman
               read him his Constitutional Rights. Leboeuf was escorted to the
               processing room where I issued him criminal citation #C7822 for
               MIP Exhibiting. I explained the citation to him, he received
               his copy, and was released. I read him an ejection notice and
               provided him with a copy. I escorted him from the coliseum.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 25 day of April, 2015, in

               at approximately 2110 hours, I was working the 2 Chainz Concert
               at Beasley Coliseum when I observed a Staff Pro employee
               escorting a male out of the concert. The male was resisting a
               little so I stepped in and placed him in a wrist lock behind
               his back. I activated my body camera and advised the male to
               quit resisting and just walk. I asked the Staff Pro employee
               what he was being ejected for and he stated he had been in the
               front of the floor and had been instigating a fight. He said he
               saw the male throw two punches. The male stated he had been
               hit. I could not see any marks on the male. As I was escorting
               him I could smell the odor of intoxicants emitting from breath
               as he spoke and I observed his speech was slurred. His eyes
               were also bloodshot and appeared watery and sleepy. At the
               doors I had the male stand against the wall and asked him to
               pull out his identification. He was identified as Brandon Mohr
               by his WA Driver's License. I observed Mohr was under the age
               of twenty one. I advised Mohr he was under arrest for Minor
               Exhibiting in a Public Place. I handcuffed him, the handcuffs
               were double locked, I advised him he had the right to an
               attorney and he was being audio and video recorded. I asked him
               if he understood what I just explained to him and he said yes.
               I had him sit outside on a wall while I filled out his
               citation. When I was finished filling out the citation I
               explained it to Mohr. I unhandcuffed him, gave him his copy of
               the citation and advised him he was trespassed from Beasley
               Coliseum for the rest of the evening. I also provided him with
               a typed copy of the trespass notice. He stated he understood. I
               advised him he was free to leave and he left. I was later
               advised Mohr was contacted across from WSU Parking Services. He
               was transported to PRH see case #15-W2011. My video was
               downloaded to the S: drive. Refer to Student Conduct. I certify

               was on patrol at Beasely Coliseum for the Springfest concert,
               2Chainz. I was watching the crowd on the floor of the coliseum
               when I observed a female fall to the ground. I ran over to help
               her and asked if she was ok. She looked up at me but did not
               say anything. I could see her eyes were bloodshot and watery
               and that she appeared to be under the age of 21. I could smell
               a very strong odor of intoxicants emitting from her. I asked if
               she was ok and she mumbled something that I could not
               understand. A male that was with her told me she was fine. He
               tried to help her stand up but she could not do so under her
               own power. After a couple of attempts she was able to stand
               with the assistance of the male. When she got to her feet she
               stumbled and swayed. I told the female she was too drunk to be
               inside at the concert and escorted her to the west end tunnel
               so I could speak to her where it was not so loud. I asked the
               female for identification and she provided her WSU Cougar Card
               identifying her as Courtney M. Rucker. She provided her
               birthday of 07-15-95. As I spoke to Rucker in the tunnel, away
               from the crowd, I could smell a very strong odor of alcohol on
               her breath. I explained to Rucker that I would be forwarding
               charges to the Whitman County Prosecutor for MIP Exhibiting. I
               told Rucker that this contact was being audio and video
               recorded and read her Miranda Rights to her. I then told her
               she was being ejected from the colisium. I read her an ejection
               noticed, warning her about trespassing, and took her bracelet
               that was given as entry onto the concert floor. I told Rucker
               she was free to leave. At about 2220 hours I heard over the
               radio that Officer Olmstead was contacting Rucker and the male
               she had been with. His report states that he "observed that the
               female was slumped over with her head on the legs of the male".
               At that time Olmstead provided Rucker with a courtsey transport
               home. Charges forwarded for MIP Exhibiting. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of

               the floor monitoring the crowd when two females came up to me
               and said that there was pushing and shoving going on in the

               me that she was punched in side of the face, causing her
               earring to fall out. I could see that her left ear was red and
               swollen. Bowman's friend, Julianna M. Ellings, said that she
               witnessed the assault. Bowman and Ellings said that the crowd
               management employee already told the suspect to leave and they
               do not know where she went. Bowman said that her main concern
               was for the safety of the people in the front row because there
               was "a ridiculous amount of pushing, shoving and hitting going
               on". Bowman said she would let me know if she saw the female
               again and that she would be sitting in the stands for the rest
               of the concert. I did not contact the StaffPro employee who

               M. Losch 10/29/95 Warned Trespassing (NOT a WSU Student)
               NARRATIVE: On 04/25/15 at approximately 2346 hours I responded
               to a sickness call at Perham Hall. Dispatch stated a female was
               vomiting in the hallway and a male was trying to pick her up
               and take her away. While en route dispatch stated the female
               and male ran out of the building and behind Perham Hall. Upon
               arrival I found a male and female leaning up against the
               southern wall of Perham Hall. I walked up to the two and told
               them why I was called to the area. The female, later identified
               as Meagan Ilene Smiley 04/05/95, said they were fine. The male
               was later identified as Kyle Martin Losch 10/29/95. I asked
               what floor they had just been on and they stated the 2nd. I
               asked Smiley if she had been vomiting and she said no. I asked
               Smiley if she had her ID and she said no. Smiley provided a
               false name of MEGAN SMILEY 04/05/95. Smiley said she did not
               have a middle name as well. While talking with Smiley I noticed
               Smiley' eyes were about halfway closed and appeared to be
               watery. I could also smell the odor of intoxicants coming from
               her breath. About this time medics arrived to evaluate Smiley.
               As soon as medics arrived Smiley said she did not want to be
               evaluated so the medics left. I cleared as well. As I was
               clearing dispatch stated they could not find a state return for
               Smiley with the information I had provided. I saw Smiley and
               Losch still standing near south wall of Perham Hall. I walked
               over to the two and asked Smiley why I would not be getting a
               return for her name. I asked Smiley to provide her name and
               date of birth again. Smiley again provided the exact same false
               information as the first time. I asked Smiley for her WSU
               student identification number and she provided it. I told
               Smiley if I found out she had lied about her name or date of
               birth she could be charged with making a false statement to a
               public servant. I asked Smiley if she wanted to change the
               information she had provided me and Smiley said no. I returned
               to my patrol car and ran Smiley's WSU ID number through Zzusis.
               I found Smiley's true name in Zzusis. I returned to Smiley and
               told her that I would be sending her to Student Conduct for

               lying about her name and MIP Exhibiting. At this point I
               cleared the area. About five minutes later Ofc. Whitman radioed
               that he was informed by the RED on duty that Smiley and Losch
               were inside Streit Perham causing issues. I responded back and
               found Smiley inside the lobby area. Smiley stated that she was
               trying to get into Perham Hall. I asked Smiley where she was
               staying. Smiley said she was staying with her friend in Streit
               Hall. Smiley's friend was standing near her. The friend was not
               identified. I told Smiley if she was staying in Streit then she
               was not supposed to be in Perham Hall. I told Smiley to return
               to Streit and she did. Just as Smiley was walking off I found
               Losch coming from Streit Hall into the lobby area. I asked
               Losch where he was staying. Losch stated he was staying on the
               second floor of Streit with friends. I asked Losch where his
               friend was. Losch stated that his friend, "Troy", had gone off
               with a girl to "hook up." I asked Losch if Troy was in the
               building and he said no. Losch stated he was trying to get into
               Troy's room but did not have a key. I told Losch that he was
               not allowed to be in the building unaccompanied. I escorted
               Losch from the building and told him if he was found in the
               building without being escorted by Troy he would be arrested
               for trespassing. Losch stated he understood. I spoke with the
               RA's who were doing rounds and informed them of the situation.
               I told the RA's to call us if they found Losch or Smiley
               unaccompanied in the building. END OF REPORT I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               approximately 0121 hours Cpl. Kuhrt and I were on patrol in the
               area of Kimbrough Hall, located at 680 NE Library Rd. When we
               drove by I could see what appeared to be a person standing on
               the northwest corner of the rooftop. Sgt. Griffin arrived on
               scene as backup officer. Sgt. Griffin, Cpl. Kuhrt, and I went
               to the rooftop to contact the individuals. Once I got to the
               top of the roof, I saw a couple of males standing in the area
               of the ladder who were later identified as Jordan D. Washington
               (DOB 05-25-93) and Matthew R. Rinaldi (DOB 12-11-92). While I
               spoke with Washington and Rinaldi, Cpl. Kuhrt went to locate
               the other two around the corner. I asked Washington and Rinaldi
               what he was doing on the roof, and they told me just enjoying
               the view. They said they were seniors and wanted to do
               something fun before graduation. I asked them if they had been
               on top of the Kimbrough roof in the past, and they both said
               no. I asked them how they got on top of the roof, and they said
               they climbed up the south side of the building and used the
               ladder. I asked if they saw the sign that said no trespassing,
               and they said yes. Cpl. Kuhrt and Sgt. Griffin brought over the
               other two individuals who were on the rooftop. The other two
               were identified as Tait J. Meyer (DOB 03-08-93) and Matthew G.
               Townsend (DOB 02-22-93). I told all of them if they were found
               on the rooftop again they would be arrested for criminal
               trespassing. All of them are WSU students. I told all of them I
               would be notifying WSU Student Conduct. We escorted them all
               off the rooftop. All of them were polite and cooperative. We
               all cleared the scene. No further action. I certify and declare

               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Elliott R. Taylor
               09/17/97 Charges Forwarded MIP Exhibiting 2. NARRATIVE: On
               04/26/15 at approximately 0159 hours I was driving westbound on
               Colorado Street when I came to a stop at the intersection of
               Colorado and B St. I turned right onto northbound B St and had
               to come to an immediate stop because there was a black Mazda 3
               facing southbound in the northbound lane. The Mazda was not
               running and blocking the whole northbound lane. I activated my
               emergency lights to warn northbound traffic of the obstruction.
               I exited my patrol car and walked up to the front of the car
               and saw a male sitting in the driver's seat. The male was later
               identified as Elliott Richard Taylor 09/17/97. I asked Taylor
               why he was stopped facing the wrong way. Taylor said he had
               lost his cell phone in the fraternity. Taylor pointed to the
               Cougar Cottage Bar. I asked Taylor if he meant the bar next to
               us and Taylor said it was the fraternity behind the bar. While
               talking with Taylor I could smell the odor of intoxicants
               coming from the car. Taylor was the only person in his car. I
               found Taylor's speech pattern to be very dramatic and over
               dramatized. I asked Taylor if he had his ID with him. Taylor
               handed me his WADL which identified him as 17 years old. I
               asked Taylor for his registration and proof of insurance.
               Taylor began to look for it but stopped after a few moments. I
               asked Taylor if he could not find it and Taylor said, "no I
               have it." Taylor had to reopen the glovebox that he already had
               looked through to grab the registration. It appeared as if
               Taylor had forgotten what I had asked for in a very short
               amount of time. I asked Taylor where he had started driving
               from and Taylor pointed to the parking lot behind the Cougar
               Cottage. About this time Cpl. Kuhrt and Ofc. Tiengo arrived on
               scene. I asked Taylor if he could come talk to me outside of
               the car. Taylor exited an joined me on the sidewalk. I asked
               Taylor how much he had to drink tonight. Taylor said he had one
               beer around 1930 and 2000 hours. I asked Taylor if he was
               willing to do some voluntary field sobriety tests and Taylor
               said that was fine. I told Taylor that I would be evaluating
               him on how well he followed my instructions as well as how well
               he performed the tests. I began the first test, HGN, in the
               gravel parking lot behind the Cougar Cottage. During the HGN
               test Taylor was not following my pen all the way. Instead

               Taylor was stopping just past my shoulder. I reminded Taylor to
               follow it all the way. I had to remind Taylor several more
               times to keep following the pen. During the test I observed,
               equal pupil size, equal tracking, and lack of smooth pursuit.
               As Taylor stood before me I could smell the odor of intoxicants
               coming from his breath. The next test was the walk and turn.
               While explaining the test Taylor stepped out of the starting
               position and stood with his feet apart for the remainder of my
               demonstration. I tried to get Taylor back into the starting
               position but Taylor decided to start the test. I told Taylor to
               stop as I had not instructed him to begin. One I told Taylor to
               begin I observed the following errors: -Not counting his steps
               out loud -Took 10 steps instead of 9 -Turned using both feet
               instead of the instructed method -Not counting his steps out
               loud on his return 9 steps The next test was the one leg stand.
               When I told Taylor to start he raised his left leg and began
               counting. I did not observe any errors. Taylor counted to 22 in
               the 30 seconds. I told Taylor the last test I had for him was
               the preliminary breath test. I told Taylor that the PBT did not
               replace the evidentiary breath test and like all the other
               tests it was voluntary. Taylor said he did not want to provide
               a PBT sample. Based on my training, experience, and
               observations I determined that Taylor was most likely in the
               0.02 to 0.04 range. I decided not to arrest Taylor for minor
               operating a moving vehicle after consuming alcohol because of
               his lower impairment level. I told Taylor that because he was a
               minor and he had been drinking I would need to call his mother
               who was staying at the Marriott in Moscow, ID. Taylor provided
               me with his mother's phone number. At this point I had probable
               cause for MIP Exhibiting on Taylor. I decided that the best
               course of action would be to release Taylor to his mother and
               let this situation be a learning experience and not file
               charges. I called Pami Sue Taylor 06/05/67 who is Taylor's
               mother. I explained to Pami what had occurred and the options
               for her to have Taylor released. While I was speaking to Pami,
               Taylor asked why he couldn't drive the car. Cpl. Kuhrt told
               Taylor that a sober person would provide a PBT sample to prove
               it. Taylor said, "I told him I had a beer so obviously I'm
               going to blow something." Pami stated that she would appreciate
               it if I could drive Taylor to Moscow and release him to her. I
               told Pami that I needed approval from my Sergeant first but I
               should be able to do that. I handed Taylor the cell phone so he
               could talk to his mother for a minute while I contacted my
               Sergeant. As soon as I handed Taylor the phone he said, "these
               fucking pigs I'm not drunk, what, this is fucking stupid."
               Taylor was clearly being verbally abusive towards his mother.
               As Taylor was talking to his mother, we decided to move his
               mother's car so we could free up the roadway. Taylor still had
               the keys in his pocket so I asked him for them. I had to ask
               for the keys three times before Taylor stuck out his hand
               slightly allowing Cpl. Kuhrt to take them. I told Taylor that I
               need the cell phone back and Taylor gave it back. I again
               talked to Pami who now stated that she wanted to call a 18 year
               old she knows who lives in Northside Hall so Taylor could be
               released to them. Pami asked if she could call me back in a few

               minutes. I told her that was fine. I asked for Pami's
               information for my case. As Pami was providing her information
               Taylor said, "where the fuck did he go with my car." I told
               Taylor if he continues to swear then I could just take him to
               the holding facility where he could wait until we got
               everything sorted out. Taylor told me that swearing is not
               against the law. I told Taylor that it is disrespectful and
               rude. Taylor interrupted me and said that its freedom of
               speech. Recognizing that Taylor was not going to listen to
               anything I had to say I stopped talking to him. After finishing
               my conversation with Pami, Pami asked if she could talk to
               Taylor. I handed Taylor the cell phone. Taylor began to yell on
               the phone to his mother, "just like last time where I got a
               fucking felony for cops witting a fake ass report." By this
               time I had tried to extend every courtesy to Taylor by not
               arresting him. By Taylor's behavior it was clear that Taylor
               had no remorse for his actions and did not think that driving
               after consuming alcohol at 17 years old was a big deal. I took
               the cell phone away from Taylor and told him he was under
               arrest for MIP Exhibiting. I handcuffed (D/L) Taylor and told
               him he was being audio and video recorded. Ofc. Tiengo read
               Taylor his Miranda Rights. Taylor stated he understood his
               rights. I walked Taylor over to my patrol car where he was
               searched incident to arrest. No weapons or illegal items were
               found. While searching Taylor, Pami called my cell phone again.
               I handed the cell phone to Cpl. Kuhrt who spoke to Pami. I
               placed Taylor in the backseat of my patrol car. Cpl. Kuhrt
               spoke with Pami for approximately seven minutes explaining the
               situation and Taylor's behavior. After Cpl. Kuhrt finished
               speaking with Pami, Cpl. Kuhrt told me that Pami was still
               trying to contact the person in Northside Hall and would call
               me back in about five minutes. I drove Taylor over to Northside
               Hall and awaited Pami's call. Once Pami called me she stated
               that she was unable to reach the person at Northside and was
               wondering if I was still willing to transport Taylor to the
               Moscow Marriott Hotel. I said I would. I transported Taylor to
               the Moscow Marriott and met with Pami near the front entrance.
               I had Taylor stay in the back of my patrol car as I spoke with
               Pami. While explaining the situation to Pami I could hear
               Taylor thrashing around in the backseat of my patrol car. I
               told Intern Roberts to tell Taylor to knock it off. Taylor
               stopped thrashing around for a few minutes before starting
               again. I opened the rear door and asked Taylor why he was
               thrashing around. Taylor said, "get me the fuck out of this
               shit." I told Taylor that I wear a body camera and his behavior
               has been recorded. I told Taylor that the Prosecutor and Judge
               could see how he was behaving. Taylor replied, "so you
               arresting me for no reason is recorded, great." I told Taylor
               that I would be requesting charges of MIP Exhibiting from the
               prosecutor. I explained the juvenile process. I started to tell
               Taylor that if he decides to come back to WSU, then Taylor
               interrupted saying, "fuck that shit, fuck you guys." At this
               point I was done listening to Taylor's rants and released him
               to his mother's custody. Once released I returned to Pullman.
               Taylor is the most disrespectful and immature juvenile I have
