               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1908 SYNOPSIS: Two vehicle, non-injury
               collision. Parties exchanged information. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 04-22-15 at about 0946
               hours I was dispatched to the report of a cold, non-injury
               vehicle collision. The RP, Thea McCracken, was requesting phone
               contact. I called McCracken and asked her what happened. She
               explained the following; she told me that on Monday, 04-20-15,
               she was driving a Zip car, WA/APJ2117, on Cougar Way near Smith
               Gym. McCracken said she was stopped, waiting to turn left into
               the parking lot to return the Zip car. She told me that she was
               waiting for traffic to clear when she was rear-ended. She said
               that there was damage to both vehicles but nobody was injured.
               She said she exchanged information with the other driver then
               called ZipCar to find out what she should do. They told her she
               needed to fill out their claim paperwork but to not call the
               police "because they won't respond if there is no injuries".
               McCracken said that after thinking about the incident she
               wanted to have it documented by the police, which is why she
               was now calling. McCracken said that she had one passenger in
               her vehicle, Kamira Nicolino. She also gave me the name of
               another friend that witnessed the incident, Natassja Haynes.
               McCracken told me that she had pictures and information for the
               other driver, but the information was at her house. She told me
               that she would get the information to me when she got home this
               afternoon. I gave McCracken my email address to send me the
               information and gave her the case number. I also explained to
               her to not hesitate to call the police in a situation such as
               this. At abuot 1045 hours I called Nicolino. She asked that I
               call her back sometime after 1pm. At about 1047 hours I called
               Haynes. I asked her what she witnessed on Monday. She said that
               she was parked, looking in her rearview mirror, when she saw
               McCracken stopped, waiting to turn left into the parking lot.
               She said McCracken was waiting for traffic to clear before
               making her turn. Haynes said that as she was looking in her
               rearview mirror she saw a car rearend McCracken's vehicle. She
               said it did not appear the car tried to brake or avoid the
               collision. She told me it looked like there was extensive front
               end damage to the other car and that the license plate fell
               off. At about 1123 hours I received an email from McCracken
               which contained pictures that she took of the collision. I
               downloaded them to Spillman Files. There was no information
               about the other driver contained in this email. I asked
               McCracken to send me that information. At about 1325 hours I

               called Nicolino. I asked her to tell me what happened. She said
               that she was a passenger in Thea's car and they were stopped,
               with their signal on, waiting to turn into the parking lot. She
               said that they were rearended. Nicolino told me that she still
               has a headache and thinks she may have suffered a concussion
               because she hit her head on the dashboard on impact. I asked
               her if she needed medical attention and she said no. I asked
               her if she has been to the doctor or hospital since the
               collision and she said no. Nicolino told me that she did not
               see the collision coming, and also provided me with Haynes'
               name as a witness. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this ____ day of

               denied having marijuana. Documentation only. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 04-22-15 at about 1058
               hours I was dispatched to the report of drugs at McEachern
               Hall. The RP, Hannah Mitchell, was the Hall Director on duty
               and was requesting phone contact. I called Mitchell and asked
               her what was going on, she explained the following; she said
               that around 1045 hours she went to North 504 for the report of
               a noise complaint. She said that she contacted the resident,
               Daniel Arceo-Martinez, who is a high school equivalency program
               student. She said that when Daniel opened the door she warned
               him for the noise and then confronted him about the odor of
               marijuana coming from his room. Mitchell said that Daniel
               became defensive and said he did not have marijuana in his
               room, and the police could check. Mitchell said that per
               protocol, she notified the program coordinator, and then spoke
               to Daniel in her office. She told me that once Daniel stepped
               from his room she was certain that the odor was coming from his
               person, rather than his room. She said that while Daniel was in
               her office she could smell the odor of marijuana emitting from
               him. She said that she questioned him about this and he
               admitted to smoking marijuana off campus and said he did not
               have any with him. Mitchell wanted the contact documented with
               the police. I gave her the case number and confirmed that she
               had notified the program coordinator. Informational only. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 22nd day of April, 2015, in Pullman,

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1918 SYNOPSIS: Report of unwanted phone
               calls and emails from an ex boyfriend. The complainant only
               wanted this documented at this point and no law enforcement
               action at this time. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               Kane, Tyler M (02-20-95) None at this time Harassment 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 04-22-15 around 1642 hrs I was dispatched to a
               reported harassment. I contacted the reporting party,
               identified as Roanna S Nam (050295), and told the following.
               Nam explained she had recently broken up with her boyfriend,
               Tyler M Kane (02-20-95). She went on to tell me since the
               breakup she has been receiving phone calls and emails from
               Kane. Nam has asked Kane to stop contacting her and blocked his
               email address and phone number. Nam added she has now started
               to receive phone calls from blocked numbers and emails from
               different email address which she believes to be from Kane. I
               asked what the subject matter of the phone calls and emails
               were. Nam explained Kane wanted her to speak to him and
               believed it was in an attempt to get back together. She added
               she has no intent of doing so and has repeatedly told him so.
               Around this point I obtained Kane's information and we
               discussed several different options. Nam told he she was aware
               of a restraining order and had obtained information on what to
               do from a Tacoma Police Officer, although she filed no report
               at that time. After explaining several options including my
               contacting Kane, Nam told me she simply wanted this incident
               documented but did not want him contacted. I asked her several
               more times regarding this and each time she explained she
               simply wanted it documented and no law enforcement action. She
               went on to tell me the phone calls have been subsiding and she
               was doing this to document the issue. I told her if she changed
               her mind to contact us and provided her with the case number
               for reference. She thanked me and we concluded our call.
               Following the conversation I contacted Whitcom and asked them
               to conduct a drivers check on Kane as well as check his
               criminal history. I found they were both clear and cleared the
               call a short time later. Nothing further at this time. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 22nd day of April, 2015, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer

               Pullman Fire arrived and transported the male to PRH. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 04-23-15 at
               0449 hours Officer Boyd and I were dispatched to a breathing
               difficulty at Yakama Apartments #660. As we were in route
               dispatch advised that the male, a Omar H. Alhowikan 101783, was
               breathing, but his wife thought he was in heart failure. Upon
               our arrival I grabbed the AED out of my trunk and we entered
               apartment #660. The door to the apartment was open and I yelled
               "Police is anyone here." A male, later identified as Naif A.
               Alhaqbani came out of the back hallway and motioned us to come
               with him. As we entered the back hallway I saw two children in
               a bedroom with two females. All four were crying. We went to
               the bedroom located at the front of the apartment. As I entered
               the room I could see the male, Omar H. Alhowikan on the bed. He
               was lying on his back with his eyes rolled back into his head.
               He was wearing underwear and a dark color top. I lay the AED on
               the bed next to his and felt for a pulse on the top of his
               foot. There wasn't one. I felt for a pulse on his left wrist
               and there wasn't one. Officer Boyd tried to hear if he was
               breathing and he wasn't. Boyd tried a sternum rub and got no
               response. We moved him to the floor. I open the AED and Boyd
               cut his shirt off. I applied the pads to his chest in the
               recommended positions and pushed the on button. After a short
               time the AED stated a shock was needed. Officer Boyd pushed the
               button and the AED applied a shock. I notified dispatch of the
               shock and that we were starting CPR. Officer Boyd began
               applying chest compressions. I had dispatch call Lt. Larsen and
               advise him of the situation. Pullman fire arrived on scene. The
               AED told us to stop compressions. The AED advised another shock
               was needed, so the button was pushed and a shock was applied.
               Pullman fire wanted to apply their AED pads, so I removed ours
               and they applied theirs. At that time I started chest
               compressions. I provided compressions for approximately 1 to 1
               1/2 minutes. The medics advised they wanted to check his pulse
               and breathing. He had a slight pulse and had agnol breathing.
               One of the medics started compressions and I was handed an IV
               bag. I was told to squeeze the bag as hard as I could. The IV
               was connected to his shin bone. Medics prepared him to be
               transported to the hospital. He was placed on a back board and
               taken to the ambulance. He was then transported to PRH. I
               photographed the room and its contents. One of the Pullman Fire

               Officers and I cleaned up the room and retrieved all equipment
               that was left behind. I took the equipment to the ambulance in
               a bio hazard bag. One of the medics stated that his condition
               was the same and they would be leaving shortly. I went back to
               the apartment and contacted Officer Boyd, neighbor Alhaqbani,
               Alhaqbani's wife, and Layla Alhunurishi. I informed them Omar
               would be transported to Pullman Regional Hospital. Omars wife
               stated she wanted Alhaqbani to go to the hospital. She would
               wait and take care of their children. Boyd and I both asked if
               Layla wanted a councilor to come by the house and she said she
               didn't. Pullman Fire left with Omar and Alhaqbani followed
               them. I called Lt. Larsen and advised him that Omar was
               breathing and had a pulse. Officer Boyd and I returned to the
               department. I gave Officer Jones the AED so he could place it
               back into service. I called the on call Dean of Students and
               informed her of the situation. I asked her to see if someone
               could check on Lyala Alhurishi. She seem to understand the
               situation, but there was a language barrier. She said she would
               and I ended the call. Back at the department all photographs
               and videos were down loaded into spillman and the department
               hard drive. At 0730 hours I called PRH to obtain a status of
               Omar. They stated that he would be transported to Sacret Heart
               Medical Center in Spokane Via Med Star. I re contacted Flores
               and informed her of Omar's change of status. She thanked me and
               we ended the call. Nothing further at this time...............
               I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws
