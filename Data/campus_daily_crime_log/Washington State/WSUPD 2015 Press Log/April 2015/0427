               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2036 SYNOPSIS: A WSU student reported
               his iPad was stolen from the CUB. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 04-27-15, at approximately
               1047 hours, Ivan P. McLennan (06-29-93) came to the WSU Police
               Department to report his iPad was stolen from the CUB. I asked
               him to provide me with the details. McLennan said he had a "DTC
               355" class in College Hall on 04-27-15 that ended at 1000. He
               said he walked from College Hall to the WSU Compton Union
               Building (CUB). He said he sat down near the entrance to the
               food court and was using his iPad. He said he had to go to the
               bathroom so he put his iPad under his backpack and placed both
               items under the bench near where he was sitting. He said when
               he came out of the bathroom, his backpack was where he left it,
               but his iPad was gone. I asked him to describe the iPad to me
               and he said he didn't know much about it as it had been issued
               to him by WSU Athletics as he is a WSU Football player. He told
               me he used the iPad as well as his iPhone 6 on the WSU Wireless
               Network. He said he last used the iPad on the Network around 10
               AM on 04-27-15. He said his Network ID is "ivan.mclennan". I
               told him I would contact the WSU IT department to see if we
               could locate the iPad on the WSU Network. I gave him my
               business card with a Police Case Number on it and asked him to
               call me if he located the iPad. I contacted Brian Hall, who
               works for WSU IT, and relayed the information regarding the
               stolen iPad. He said he would keep an eye out for it on the
               Network and would let me know if he was able to locate it.
               Wanda Tennant is the Athletics Staff Member who is in charge of
               issuing iPads to WSU Student Athletes. I have sent her an e-
               mail asking for more specifics about the stolen iPad. As soon
               as I get the information from Tennant, I will enter the stolen
               iPad into NCIC. More to follow. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 27th day of
               April, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: JAK/333 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2039 SYNOPSIS: A 9mm Hand Gun, 1
               Magazine with 3 to 4 rounds of 9mm Ammunition, and 1 amplifier
               were reported stolen from a vehicle which was parked in the Nez
               Perce Village Apartments parking lot. The items were stolen
               sometime between 2130 and 04-26-15 0800 on 04-27-15. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: Dylan J.H. Lewis
               (03-18-94) came to the WSU Police Department on 04-27-15 at
               approximately 1507 hours to report he is a victim of a vehicle
               prowl. I spoke with Lewis who said his 9mm Hand Gun, 1 Magazine
               with 3 to 4 rounds of 9mm Ammunition, and 1 amplifier were
               stolen from his vehicle (WA/AOG3151). He believes the vehicle
               prowl occurred sometime after 2130 hours on 04-26-15 and 0800
               hours on 04-27-15. Lewis said his vehicle was parked just
               outside of his apartment and would have heard if someone opened
               his car doors. He went to sleep at approximately 2130 hours on
               04-26-15 and went out to his car at approximately 0800 on 04-
               27-15. Lewis said he may have left his vehicle unlocked, but is
               not sure. There was no sign of forcible entry into his car. He
               described his Hand Gun as being manufactured by Stava and said
               it is a model M88A (9mm). He said he kept the handgun under the
               back portion of the driver's seat. He said he kept 1 Magazine
               with 3 to 4 rounds of 9mm ammunition in the center console of
               his car. He also said he had 1 amplifier stolen from the trunk
               of his car. I asked him if he had a button or lever inside his
               car to open the trunk. He said he believes someone accessed his
               trunk by folding his back seats down. He said there were a few
               items in the back seat area he normally kept in the trunk area
               of the car. I asked Lewis if he had the serial numbers of the
               Hand Gun and Amplifier. He said he though he had the paperwork
               at his apartment and would provide me with the requested
               information when he found it. He brought in a copy of the
               purchase order for his Hand Gun. As of 0645 hours on 04-28-15,
               Lewis has not provided me with any information about his stolen
               Amplifier. I have filled out a form to have the WSUPD Records
               Department enter the stolen Hand Gun into the NCIC Data System.
               More to follow. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury

               INSURANCE: Self Insured DAMAGE: $80.00 WITNESS(ES): Lehnertz,
               Gunnar E (073191) NARRATIVE: On 04-27-15 around 1634 hrs I was
               requested to respond to a report of a two vehicle non injury
               collision in the alley at 535 NE Maiden Ln between a Pullman
               city vehicle and another vehicle. Upon my arrival I spoke with
               Ofc Mykelbust of the the Pullman Police Department and was told
               the following. Mykelbust explained a Ofc Lambert of the Pullman
               Police was driving the Code Enforcement Vehicle (Wa. 41705D),
               and parked in the alley along a fence line where I saw the
               vehicle. Lambert was outside of the vehicle when a second
               vehicle (Wa. ATK8073) driven by Mohammed H Almahrouqi (07-19-
               93) backed out of the carport and into the side of Lamberts
               vehicle. Mykelbust also explained Almahrouqi had a passenger,
               Gunnar E Lehnertz (07-31-91), whom he had spoken with and
               needed to leave shortly. After speaking with Mykelbust I spoke
               with Lehnertz and was told the following. Lehnertz explained he
               had been in the car with Almahrouqi, who had been driving.
               Almahrouqi had been backing out of the carport when the
               collision with Lambert's vehicle took place. I asked him which
               vehicle they had been in and he pointed to a black Honda Civic,
               which was registered to Almahrouqi. After speaking with
               Lehnertz I photographed both vehicles before noting a small
               dent just behind the rear passenger side door of Lambert's
               vehicle. While photographing Almahrouqi's vehicle I noticed the
               passenger side rear bumper cover had paint transfer from
               Lamberts vehicle and appeared to be misaligned. After I
               completed taking photographs of the vehicles I spoke with
               Almahrouqi who told me the following. Almahrouqi told me he and
               Lehnertz had exited his apartment and were entering his vehicle
               to leave. He went on to explain a red Honda Civic had been
               illegally parked next to him and as he began backing out he was
               trying to make sure he did not hit it. As he continued to back
               he struck the vehicle Lambert, whom he told me he did not
               recall seeing prior to backing out. The result of the collision
               put a small dent Lamberts vehicle along with damaging the rear
               passenger side bumper cover of his vehicle. At this point I
               spoke with Lambert who explained he had been outside of the
               vehicle when the collision had taken place. He went on to tell

               me he had been away from his vehicle as Almahrouqi had began
               backing. Once Almahrouqi had struck his vehicle Lambert had
               activated his camera and notified Whitcom on the collision.
               Around this point I reviewed the information I had been given
               by Almahrouqi, which had not been run and attached previously
               by Mykelbust. Shortly after this I returned Almanhrouqi's

               infraction and I told him based upon what I had seen I was not
               going to issue an infraction. We continued to speak for a short
               period before we concluded our conversation and I spoke with
               Lambert. Lambert had no questions additional questions after
               which I cleared and returned to patrol. Nothing further. I

               hours I was dispatched to a cold vehicle prowl call at the

               reporting party, Christina C. Tzintzun 03/07/95, who stated
               that her car had been broken into. Tzintzun stated that she had
               parked her car in the blue lot on 04/20/15 at approximately
               1200 hours. Tzintzun said she was sure that she had locked the
               doors. On 04/27/15 at approximately 2100 hours Tzintzun
               returned to her 2000 Ford Mustang and found her driver's side
               door ajar. Tzintzun opened the door and found the center
               console and glove box open. There were papers scattered around
               the interior of the vehicle as if someone had rummaged through
               it. Tzintzun looked through her car and the only thing missing
               was an Apple Ipod Touch 1st generation 16GB. Tzintzun said she
               has the only key for the car and does not know how they gained
               access. I looked over the car and found no pry marks or new
               damage to the car. I provided Tzintzun with my business card
               and her case number. I asked Tzintzun if she had the serial
               number for the Ipod and Tzintzun said she did not know. I asked
               Tzintzun to email me the serial number if she comes across it.

               #5Z0545108 2. NARRATIVE: On 04/28/15 at about 0034 hours I was
               on patrol at the intersection of Stadium Way and Cougar Way
               facing northbound when a vehicle passed traveling southbound. I
               had my window rolled down and could hear the vehicle was
               equipped with studded tires. As the vehicle passed I could see
               in my rearview mirror there was white light showing to the rear
               of the vehicle. I turned on the vehicle and could clearly see
               white light showing from the drivers side tail light. I
               activated my overhead lights to stop the vehicle. The vehicle
               license was partially obscured by the ball of the trailer hitch
               on the vehicle. I later identified the vehicle license as
               ID/S47933. The driver pulled over to the side of Stadium Way
               near the Fine Arts parking garage. I contacted the driver, Cory
               J. Dickinson (082689), and told him the stop was being
               recorded. I asked him for his license, registration, and proof
               of insurance. I asked him if he knew why I stopped him and he
               said he thought it was because of the broken tail light. I said
               yes, and because he still had studded tires on his vehicle.
               Studded tires are not allowed after March 31. He told me he had
               received a warning for have studded tires on his vehicle. As he
               was looking for his other information he found a warning ticket
               written by Officer Westerman on 04/13/15 for studded tires. He
               handed me his Idaho drivers license and expired vehicle
               registration and expired proof of insurance. I went back to my
               vehicle and ran his drivers license through dispatch. Dispatch
               advised he was suspended in the third degree in Washington, and
               valid in Idaho. I went back to the vehicle and asked Dickinson
               to step out of the vehicle, he did. I told him he was under
               arrest for driving with a suspended license and placed him in
               handcuffs(DL). I informed him he was being audio and video
               recorded and read him Miranda warnings from my department
               issued Miranda warnings card. I searched Dickinson incident to
               arrest and explained I was going to write him a citation,
               release him and he could call a friend to pick him up. Officer
               Westerman asked him if it was all right if we moved the vehicle
               off the roadway into the Fine Arts parking garage. Dickinson
               said that was all right. Officer Westerman drove the vehicle
               into the garage, I placed Dickinson into the back of my vehicle
               and I drove into the parking garage as well. I completed the
               citation for DWLS 3rd (#5Z0545108) and explained it to
04/28/15         Washington State University Police Department               337

               Dickinson. I removed the handcuffs, gave Dickinson his property
               and the citation and told him he was free to go, but not to
               drive. Cited and released. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 28th day of April,
