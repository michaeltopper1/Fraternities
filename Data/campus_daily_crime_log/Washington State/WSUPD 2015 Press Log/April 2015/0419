               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 04-19-15 at about 0956 hours I
               was dispatched to the report of a lockout. The RP, Christopher
               P. Routen, was requesting contact in front of WSUPD. I
               responded and contacted Routen who told me that he needed help
               unlocking a room big enough for 400 people. He told me that
               every Sunday his RSO group reserves the Todd Auditorium but
               today there was a different RSO scheduled for that room. Routen
               explained that he needed assistance with unlocking an
               auditorium in another building to accommodate his group of 400
               church-goers. I explained to Routen that without consent from
               the person in charge of a room that could accommodate his group
               I would not be able to unlock it for him. He stated he
               understood and said he was trying to work with CUB staff to use
               the auditorium there. I did not unlock any rooms for Routen.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 19th day of April, 2015, in

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Olmstead/339 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1853 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched to a
               report of harassment at the Nez Perce Apartments. Mackenzie J.
               Ellis (DOB 02-08-1994) reported that someone had deflated two
               of the tires on her vehicle. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 04-19-2015 at about 1644 hrs I
               was dispatched to a report of harassment at the Nez Perce
               Apartments, located at 1445 NE North Fairway Road. I arrived on
               scene and contacted the complainant, Mackenzie J. Ellis (DOB
               02-08-1994). Ellis resides at Nez Perce Apartments #L49. Ellis
               stated that on 04-18-2015 at about 2345 hrs she parked her
               silver, 2002 Hyundai Accent (WA Lic. 761YSB) in the parking lot
               outside her apartment. On 04-19-2015 at about 0700 hrs Ellis
               returned to her vehicle and discovered that it was unlocked,
               both of the passenger side doors were not completely latched,
               both passenger side tires were deflated, and her vehicle would
               not start. Ellis thought she had locked her vehicle the day
               before when she parked it, but was not sure. Ellis said the
               interior of her vehicle was undisturbed, and it did not appear
               that anyone had entered her vehicle. Ellis stated that nothing
               was missing from inside her vehicle. I observed that both
               passenger side tires had been deflated. The valve stem caps had
               been removed from both tires, and I found one of the caps on
               the ground near the rear tire. I did not see any damage to the
               sidewalls of the tires. It appears that someone had deflated
               the tires by letting air out of the valve stems. Ellis
               speculated that because the doors were not latched, the dome
               light would have stayed on and drained the vehicle's battery.
               Ellis said that she had tried to jump start her vehicle earlier
               today, but it still would not start. I checked the engine
               compartment of Ellis' vehicle, but nothing appeared to be
               damaged or out of place. I photographed Ellis' vehicle, and the
               photographs have been downloaded into Spillman and attached to
               this case. Ellis did not have any idea who might have done this
               to her vehicle, other than she has been dealing with a previous
               incident of harassment. For more information, see related case
               15-W903. At this point in the investigation, it does not appear
               that Ellis' vehicle has been physically damaged. Ellis said she
               would contact Les Schwab tomorrow and have them respond to
               service her vehicle. Ellis will contact me if she determines
               that her vehicle has been damaged. No suspects or leads were
               identified. No further action at this time. Olmstead/339 I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and

               side of the building. I asked Hiemstra and Freibott if they
               knew they should not be on the roof, and they both said yes and
               apologized. Hiemstra said she has been on the roof of Kimbrough
               Hall multiple times in the past. Freibott told us this was her
               first time on the rooftop. I told Hiemstra and Friebott if they
               were found on the rooftop again they would be arrested for
               criminal trespassing. Hiemstra and Friebott said they

               report of a citizen dispute at Scott Hall. Upon further
               investigation, it was determined that no physical altercation
               had occurred. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 04-19-2015 at about 2314 hrs I was dispatched to
               a report of a citizen dispute on the north side of Scott Hall,
               located at 1310 NE Cougar Way. I arrived on scene, along with
               several other officers from WSUPD and PPD. I observed a group
               of males sitting around a campfire in the backyard of a
               residence on Alfred Lane. Upon further investigation, it was
               determined that no physical altercation or dispute had
               occurred. The original report of a citizen dispute is
               unfounded. No further action at this time. Olmstead/339 I
