               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2075 SYNOPSIS: Subject contacted for a
               welfare check. He requested to go to PRH to speak with an MHP.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 04-29-
               15 at about 0720 hours I was dispatched to the report of a
               welfare check. Whitcom advised that they had received a call
               from Charise P. Deberry regarding Tommy Ho. Deberry stated that
               she had received a text message from Ho at 0340 hours that
               thanked her for everything and stated that he was "slowly dying
               right now". Deberry said that she had tried calling Ho several
               times since seeing the text and his phone is going to
               voicemail. Deberry did not know Ho's address, but knew he lived
               in the Stephenson Complex. I was able to determine that Ho
               lives in Stephenson South room 1211. Officer Stewart and I
               responded there. We knocked on the door and a male answered and
               asked "did somebody call about me?" I confirmed with the male
               that his name is Tommy and asked if we could speak to him in
               the lounge, he agreed. I asked Tommy what was going on. He said
               that he has been very sad and that he has a lot going on. I
               asked Tommy if he is feeling like hurting himself and he said
               that he did not feel that way at the moment but he does at
               night, when he is alone. He said that he was feeling very
               lonely last night and had thoughts of committing suicide. I
               asked Tommy how he would do that and he said he would "walk out
               the window". As we spoke he looked at the window several times.
               I asked Tommy if he felt safe living on the 12th floor and his
               response was that it is "ironic". I asked Tommy if he sees a
               counselor and he said yes, but does not have another
               appointment until next Tuesday. I asked him if he would like to
               speak to a conselor right now. After thinking about it he said
               yes. Stewart tried to call WSU Counseling Services but they
               were not open. We spoke with Tommy about going to PRH to speak
               to a counselor and he said he wanted to do that. I transported
               Tommy, voluntarily, to PRH to speak with a mental health
               professional. Once there I briefed ER staff on what was going
               on. Vievu video was downloaded to the S: drive. Send case to
               WSU Counseling services. Nothing further. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               29th day of April, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               telephone calls to a pet loss hotline. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On April 29, 2015 at about 0846
               hours I was dispatched to the report of harassing telephone
               calls to a WSU phone number. I contacted the complainant, Anne
               V. Lafrance (02/02/52), by telephone as requested. Lafrance
               told me she is in charge of the WSU Pet Loss Hotline. Over the
               past year the hotline has received eight (8) or nine (9) calls
               from a female caller who is "abusive" to the volunteers
               answering the hotline. The incoming number is 617-628-4356.
               This area code is from Massachusetts. Lafrance indicated the
               female caller may have some mental issues. Lafrance said she
               just wants the telephone number blocked. She was told that she
               needed a WSU Police report number before WSU IT will block the
               number. The WSU Pet Loss Hotline number is 1-866-266-8635 or
               509-335-5704. When I Googled "pet loss hotline" WSU was the
               first non advertisement listed. I contacted Cecil Floyd and
               John Daleo, WSU IT regarding the process of blocking incoming
               telephone numbers. I learned that WSU does not have a mechanism
               in place to block incoming numbers. They can block outgoing. In
               addition the 866 number belongs to Sprint. I recontacted
               Lafrance, explained what I was told by Floyd and Daleo. I
               provided Lafrance with contact information for Daleo. She was
               going to speak with him about other alternative solutions. No
               further investigation at this time. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 29th day of

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2089 SYNOPSIS: Report of a physical
               domestic in progress. One subject was arrested and booked into
               Whitman County Jail for Assault 4th Degree Domestic Violence.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Tofaagaoalii Laa/08-30-
               91 Arrested & Booked Assault 4th DV 2. NARRATIVE: On 04-29-15
               at approximately 1725 hours, Ofc. Welter and I responded to
               Columbia Apartment J28 for the report of a physical domestic.
               When we arrived, I could hear a male and female voice yelling
               at each other inside the apartment. I knocked on the door and I
               heard the male say just a minute. After a few seconds, I
               knocked again and advised them to come to the door. A male,
               later identified as Fiaai Robert Moliga/05-19-90, answered the
               door. I asked him to step outside and speak with Ofc. Welter. I
               went inside the apartment and found the female, later
               identified as Tofaagaoalii Laa/08-30-91, sitting on the couch.
               I asked if anyone else was in the apartment and she said no. I
               advised her I was video and audio recording and she said she
               understood. I asked her what was going on and she stated her
               and her boyfriend, Moliga, had been having an argument over
               something stupid. I asked her how long they had been dating and
               she said three years. I asked her what the argument was over
               and she said just stupid stuff. I asked her what happened and
               she said nothing. While speaking with her, she wiped her cheek
               with her right hand and I could see what appeared to be the
               beginning of a bruise on the knuckle of her little finger. It
               appeared red and slightly swollen. I asked her if the argument
               had been physical and she said no. I asked her if she had hit
               him and she said no. I asked her if she had pushed him and she
               said yes, just a small push on the arm to get him to go away. I
               asked her if he had hit her at all and she said no. I asked her
               if he had pushed her and she said no. Laa did not really answer
               any other questions and kept saying it was just a stupid
               argument. I went outside and spoke to Ofc. Welter. He stated
               Moliga had told him she had gone through his cell phone and
               found some things she didn't like. She then got mad and,
               "freaked out" on him. He stated she hit him several times with
               her right fist to the side of his face. I could see a scratch
               mark and his ear appeared red. I later took photographs of the
               side of his face. Ofc. Welter stated he had seen what appeared
               to be blood on Moliga's lip when he first began speaking to
               him. Moliga had also told the dispatcher he was bleeding from
               the mouth when he called. Based on this information, Whitcom
               had paged medics and had them staged. We told them they could

               come into the scene and Moliga refused treatment so they
               cleared. I returned to Laa and advised her she was under arrest
               for Assault 4th Degree DV and she had the right to an attorney.
               I allowed her to get a pair of pants, her cell phone, wallet,
               shoes, and a hair bungee. She was handcuffed, the handcuffs
               were double locked, and I advised her of her Miranda Warnings
               which she stated she understood. Laa was transported to Pullman
               PD and later booked into the Whitman County Jail. Moliga was
               provided the DV and victim packet of information. I certify and

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: ENW/328 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2090 SYNOPSIS: Report of the
               unauthorized use of a credit card from two businesses. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 04-29-15 I was
               dispatched to a reported fraud at 1650 NE Valley Rd. I
               contacted the complainant, later identified as Danlin Ling (01-
               14-90) and was told the following. Lin explained her mother,
               Xiaotong Lin (01-14-64) had her US Bank account compromised.
               She went on to tell me there were two unauthorized transactions
               made on the card, one to Jack In The Box totaling $4.62, and
               another made to Red Bento in the amount of $15.12. Both
               transactions were made on 04-13-15 and after noticing the
               transactions US Bank was contacted. While speaking with
               representatives from US Bank, Lin learned the mailing address
               for the account had also been changed to 1455 NE Brandi Way;
               N301. I asked Lin if she had any other information on the
               transactions and if I could speak with her mother. She told me
               she did not know and she asked if she could translate for her
               mother since she had difficulties speaking english. I told her
               that would be fine and asked if they knew anyone who lived at
               the address she had provided me. She told me she didn't know
               anyone there at which point she was provided with the case
               number for reference. I told her I would contact her if I
               learned anything or had any further questions and she told me
               that would be fine. After speaking with Lin I contacted Jack In
               The Box and spoke with a manager. I learned they have a limited
               video surveillance system, but he would be happy to try and
               help to identify a subject. He went on to explain the
               information he needed and I told him I would be in contact with
               him when I had the information he requested. After speaking
               with him I contacted Red Bento and was told management would
               have to be advised and they would call me back once they had
               spoken with them. I also conducted a search of Spillman for the
               address provided to me by Lin. I learned the address came back
               to an individual named Majed I Badry (04-15-84). A further
               check of Zzusis showed he had changed his address as of 01-15
               and now lives on Latah St. At this point I contacted Ofc
               Burkett of the Pullman Police Department to let him know what I
               had learned regarding this case and that it appears the crimes
               are occurring in his jurisdiction. Burkett asked me if I would
               continue with my investigation since I had the information and
               I told him I would before concluding our call. I continued to
               try and locate a current resident at the 1455 NE Brandi Way
               address I had been provided and have yet to locate anyone. At

               2044 hrs I heard back from Red Bento management. They told me
               their surveillance system is only held on their system for 7
               days and would not be of any help at this point. I thanked them
               for checking and will ask dayshift to assign someone to go to
               Jack In The Box and review their surveillance footage for a
               possible suspect before proceeding further. Investigation
               continues. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 29th day of April, 2015, in Pullman,
