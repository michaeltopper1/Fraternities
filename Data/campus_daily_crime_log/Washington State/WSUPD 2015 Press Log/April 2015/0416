               NARRATIVE: On 04/16/15 at approximately 0757 hours Pullman
               Police Department was dispatched to a two car unknown injury
               collision at Terre View and State Route 270. After Officers
               arrived in the area they found the collision to be at Terre
               View and just north of Animal Science Road. Pullman Officer
               requested a WSUPD Officer to respond since they believed the
               collision occurred in WSUPD jurisdiction. I responded to the
               call. Upon arrival I contacted Ofc. Crow who had already
               contacted the driver of both vehicles. Ofc. Crow stated that
               the front car had stopped quickly for a squirrel in the roadway
               and the second car ran into the back of it. The collision
               occurred in the roadway of Terre View which is the jurisdiction
               of the Pullman Police Department. I did not want to argue in
               front of the people involved in the collision so I took the
               case. Ofc. Crow provided me with the driver's licenses, vehicle
               registrations, and proof of insurances, for all involved. About
               this time Ofc. Crow left the scene. I contacted Nicole Marie
               Hessner 12/04/92 who had been driving a 2004 Honda Accord.
               Hessner said she was driving northbound on Terre View when a
               squirrel ran from the eastside sidewalk into the roadway in
               front of her. Hessner quickly braked to avoid the squirrel.
               Hessner said that was when she was rear ended. I asked Hessner
               if she had crossed either the center or fog line. Hessner said
               she stopped in the middle of her lane. Lucas James Verge
               09/22/93 was the passenger in Hessner's car and provided the
               same account of the incident. I asked Hessner and Verge if they
               would like medical attention and both said the medics already
               checked them out prior to my arrival. Both Hessner and Verge
               stated they were wearing their seatbelts. I next spoke with
               Nathaniel Brian Allen 01/02/77 who stated he was a witness. I
               asked Allen what he saw. Allen stated he drove up on the
               collision after it had happened and had seen all the debris in
               the roadway. Allen stated he knew the driver of the second
               vehicle so he stopped to check on him. Allen did not see the

               collision occur. Lastly I spoke with Huba J. Leidenfrost
               11/15/68 who was driving a 1982 Ford F150. Leidenfrost stated
               he was driving northbound on Terre View behind Hessner when
               Hessner quickly braked for the squirrel. Leidenfrost stated he
               tried to brake but his foot went to the floor as if his brakes
               were not working. Leidenfrost let off the brake and tried
               again. This time his brakes started to grab. Leidenfrost
               started to veer to the shoulder to avoid Hessner but it was too
               little to late and he rear ended Hessner. Leidenfrost's
               driver's side front corner of his truck collided with Hessner's
               rear end. Looking at the roadway there were approximately 30
               feet of skid marks left on the pavement from Leidenfrost's
               truck as he tied to stop. The skid marks start form the center
               of the lane and end near the shoulder of the roadway next to a
               large pile of debris. The skid marks and debris matched up to
               the accounts provided by Hessner and Leidenfrost. Ofc. Jones
               photographed the scene and damage to both cars. The photos were
               uploaded to the files folder. The damage of to the Honda is
               estimated at $4000 dollars. The damage to the Ford is estimated
               at $1000 dollars. A PTCR was completed and sent to the State
               Patrol. END OF REPORT I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 16th day of April,

               at the Red 2 parking lot. Dispatch stated that Jane Marie
               Lawford 03/07/61 called that there were two dogs in a dark
               colored Jeep that looked "unhappy." I responded to the area and
               found the jeep and two people standing next to it. I contacted
               Ian Henry Guest 11/19/75, who said the dogs belonged to him.
               Guest stated he has three dogs who were in the trailer. Guest
               showed me the dogs who were in kennels inside the enclosed
               trailer. The dogs had water and food. The dogs were clearly
               well taken care of. Guest told me that he raises dogs to be
               bomb detection dogs and was on his way to a training. Guest
               guessed that the dogs were probably barking earlier which is
               why someone called. Since the dogs were well taken care for I
               cleared. END OF REPORT I certify and declare under penalty of

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1787 SYNOPSIS: Report of two males
               sitting in a car for over an hour near the J building of
               Chinook Village. The vehicle was contacted and two males were
               warned for possession of marijuana. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE 1.
               Tanner Lee Hull 11/16/95 Student Conduct Poss. of Marijuana 2.
               Peter Nevius Readdy 03/14/96 Student Conduct Poss. of Marijuana
               NARRATIVE: On 04/16/15 at approximately 1422 hours I was
               dispatched to a drugs call near the J building of Chinook
               Village. Jennifer Anne Duke 03/11/94, called to report two
               males sitting in a silver car for over an hour. Duke just found
               it suspicious. I responded to the area and found the described
               car. As I neared the car two males exited the car and appeared
               to be very nervous. I asked the two if we could talk and they
               stopped. The two males were later identified as Tanner Lee Hull
               11/16/95 and Peter Nevius Readdy 03/14/96. I asked the two how
               long they had been sitting in their car. Hull said only for a
               little bit. I told the two what had been reported to me. From
               standing outside the car I could see a blow torch that is
               commonly used with drugs. I asked Readdy and Hull for their
               IDs. Hull provided his WADL and Readdy provided his Cougar
               Card. Both Hull and Readdy were identified as under the age of
               21. I told the two as long as they were willing to destroy
               their marijuana and smoking devices this case would only be
               referred to student conduct and I would not be taking legal
               action. Both eagerly agreed. Hull turned over a small amount of
               marijuana concentrate. Readdy grabbed a glass stem that they
               had used to smoke with. Hull, Readdy, and I walked over to the
               trash can where they destroyed their illegal items. I explained
               Washington's marijuana laws and the student conduct process to
               both. Both stated they understood and walked away. END OF
               REPORT I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the
               laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 16th day of April, 2015, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer

               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Gustav Henry Carstens/10-25-92 Cited
               Negligent Driving 1st C-8762 2. NARRATIVE: On 04-16-15 at
               approximately 2132 hours, I was traveling east bound on
               Colorado St near Parking Services when I observed a vehicle
               traveling west bound which appeared to be traveling in excess
               of the posted 20 mph speed limit. I could see the vehicle was
               increasing in speed and could hear the engine throttling
               louder. I activated the SMD (speed measuring device) in the
               moving mode. The patrol vehicle speed shown on the SMD matched
               the speed shown on my vehicle's speedometer. The SMD emitted an
               increasing high pitched audio tone. I saw no obstructions
               between my location and the defendant's vehicle when I obtained
               the reading. The SMD displayed a speed of 46 mph for the
               defendant's vehicle. At the time, the defendant's vehicle was
               alone. The weather was clear, the road was dry, it was night,
               and there was no other vehicle traffic, but a lot of pedestrian
               traffic in the area. I operated MPH Python III Directional
               Radar Serial # 846004571, Front Antenna # 855006706, Rear
               Antenna # 855006705, Tuning Fork numbers 395438 and 395723.
               Both tuning forks are certified. I checked the calibration of
               the SMD before and after my shift and it is in proper working
               order. Calibration is tested by the use of the internal test,
               light test and external test with the tuning forks. On the
               aforementioned day, the following are the test results. A light
               test displayed all "8"s in the first two LED readout windows
               and "188" in the third (patrol) window. For the internal test,
               the stationary test result is a "32" mph in the target window
               and moving mode test result is "32" in target and "32" in
               patrol windows, followed by the Doppler tones. The unit passed
               the internal test by stating "PASS" in the fast window. The
               test results for the external test is "30", "35", and "65" for
               the moving mode. For stationary mode, the test results were
               "65" and "35". The unit passed the external test. The radar is
               certified by the factory and Day Wireless Technicians, and is
               in proper working order. I have successfully completed a
               Washington State Criminal Justice Training Commission approved
               course in the operation of Police Traffic Radar. I have
               received instruction in the use of the above-described SMD and
               it is operated according to the instructions and training at
               the time of the contact. This SMD is calibrated every two years
               in accordance with Washington State University Police

               Department Policy. All certifications for the radar unit, both
               tuning forks, and my SMD certifications are on file with the
               Whitman County Courts. I activated my emergency lights as the
               vehicle approached and began to turn on the vehicle. As I did,
               I heard the vehicle down shift and then accelerate. At the
               time, I thought the vehicle was going to attempt to elude me. I
               turned and observed the vehicle turn down C St next to
               Valhalla's Bar. I activated my siren at this time. I followed
               behind the vehicle and it turned into 850 NE C St parking lot.
               I stopped behind the vehicle, and activated my VieVu camera as
               I exited my vehicle. As I contacted the driver, I advised him
               the traffic stop was being recorded. I explained to him the
               reason for the stop and he stated he had been driving his
               passenger home. As the driver spoke, I could smell a very
               strong odor of intoxicants emitting from the vehicle which
               became stronger as he spoke. I observed the odor emitting from
               his breath. I also observed the driver's eyes were very
               bloodshot, and appeared watery and sleepy. As he spoke, I could
               hear his speech was slurred. When I asked for his driver's
               license, I observed his movements were slow. The male was
               identified as Gustav H. Carstens by his WA Driver's License. I
               asked Gustav how much he had to drink today and he said
               nothing. He stated he had just gotten done rock climbing and
               held his hand out to show me the white chalk on his hand. I
               could see a Coors Beer paper bracelet on his right wrist which
               is often used for entrance into a drinking area such as a bar
               or beer garden. I asked Gustav if he would be willing to take a
               PBT test and he said, "No, not here". I asked him if he would
               square his shoulders to me in the car so I could look at his
               eyes and he said yes. He told me he had a lazy left eye and was
               wearing contacts. I advised him to follow the tip of my finger
               without moving his head. I did a couple of passes and noticed
               his eyes were equal size and had equal tracking. I also
               observed his eyes lacked smooth pursuit. I again asked Gustav
               how much he had to drink and he said none. I asked him to
               remain in the vehicle. I did a driver's check on Gustav and
               waited for Ofc. Tiengo to arrive. Once he arrived, Ofc. Tiengo
               asked Gustav if he would be willing to perform voluntary field
               sobriety tests. Gustav said no. I asked Gustav to step from the
               vehicle. As he got to the rear of the vehicle, I told him to
               turn around and place his hands behind his back. I advised him
               he was under arrest for Negligent Driving 1st Degree and I
               advised him he had the right to an attorney. I handcuffed
               Gustav and double locked the handcuffs. Ofc. Tiengo searched
               Gustav while I spoke to his passenger. I asked her if she had
               been drinking and she said no, and then stated she had drank 5
               hours prior to the stop. I asked her if I asked Gustav if she
               could drive the vehicle and I verified she was sober, if she
               would be willing to drive the car. She said yes. I noticed she
               had gum in her mouth and I had her spit it out. I had her
               remain in the vehicle while I filled out the citation for
               Gustav. After I was done, I returned to the car and asked her
               to take a PBT test and she agreed. She was not able to drive

    Narrative: RVWD: 316 / OFC: DBT/321 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1797 SYNOPSIS: Subjects could be seen
               smoking marijuana from a window of Streit Hall. A small amount
               of marijuana and a pipe were destroyed. Students referred to
               student conduct. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Julian

               Arbogast/05-27-96 Warned Poss. of Marijuana NARRATIVE: On 04-
               16-15 at approximately 2253 hours Cpl. Kuhrt and I were on foot
               patrol behind Streit Hall, located at 1620 NE Cougar Way. Cpl.
               Kuhrt observed two males in a room on the fourth floor of
               Streit Hall appearing to be smoking marijuana. Cpl. Kuhrt and I
               went up to the fourth floor of Streit Hall. As soon as we got
               up there, we saw three males leaving room #405. The three males
               were later identified as Julian J. Goldman (DOB 02-06-96),
               David P. Yingling (DOB 07-12-96), and Nicholas S. Arbogast (DOB
               05-27-96). Cpl. Kuhrt asked them what they had been doing when
               we observed them through their window a couple minutes ago.
               Eventually, Arbogast said "smoking". Cpl. Kuhrt asked how much
               weed was in the room, and asked if there was pounds. Goldman
               sighed and said no. I asked if any of them were 21 years of
               age, and if any of them had a medical marijuana card. They all
               said no to both questions. Goldman said he lived in room #405.
               I asked how much weed was in the room. Goldman said probably a
               gram. I told Goldman if he wanted to destroy the marijuana we
               would only be notifying student conduct and not be pursuing any
               criminal charges. Goldman said he wanted to handle it that way.
               Goldman admitted to having smoked, while Yingling and Arbogast
               both denied smoking. While I was running their names through
               Dispatch, Cpl. Kuhrt was speaking with the three of them. Cpl.
               Kuhrt told Yingling he looked like the other male he saw
               smoking in the window. Yingling then admitted to having smoked
               as well. When Goldman opened the door to his room to retrieve
               his marijuana, I could smell the odor of marijuana emitting
               from the room. Goldman brought out a small amount of fresh
               marijuana and a pipe. I walked with Goldman down to one of the
               dumpsters outside, and I watched him throw the marijuana and
               the pipe away. Cpl. Kuhrt and I cleared the scene. No further
               action. My Vievu camera was activated, and the video has been
               downloaded into the permanent digital evidence folder. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 17th day of April, 2015, in Pullman,

               DEPARTMENT CASE #:15-W1801 SYNOPSIS: Agency assist for WCSO for
               DRE Evaluation. Evaluation completed and blood draw performed.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               04/16/15 at approximately 2325 hours Whitcom radioed and asked
               if I was available to administer a DRE Evaluation for Dep.
               Waltz. I said I was and that I would meet Dep. Waltz at PPD.
               Ofc. Tiengo and I responded to PPD where I met with Dep. Waltz.
               Dep. Waltz explained that he stopped the subject, Laddiego
               Duncan, for crossing the center line by approximately 4 feet,
               repetitive lane travel issues, and going 45MPH in a 60MPH speed
               zone. Dep. Waltz said Duncan performed field sobriety tests and
               did so poorly showing many signs of impairment. Dep. Waltz said
               Duncan admitted to taking Clonazepam. I first saw Duncan in the
               holding facility of Pullman PD. I listened while Dep. Waltz
               read Duncan his Constitutional Rights. While Duncan was
               speaking his words were slow, deliberate, and slurred. It was
               difficult to understand Duncan and I had to pay close attention
               in order to understand him. Once Dep. Waltz was finished with
               the Constitutional Rights, I asked Duncan if he would provide a
               PBT sample. I explained to Duncan that the PBT did not replace
               the evidentiary breath test and that it was voluntary. Duncan
               said he would provide a sample. I ensured the PBT (FST #102460)
               was working properly and Duncan provided a sample of .000 at
               0000 hours. I explained the DRE evaluation to Duncan and asked
               if he would submit to the evaluation. Duncan said he would. I
               told Duncan that his rights still applied during the
               evaluation. I activated my VieVu camera during the evaluation.
               I began the evaluation at 0000 hours and finished at 0041
               hours. At the end of the evaluation it was my opinion as a
               certified DRE that Duncan was under the influence of a CNS
               Depressant and was unable to operate a vehicle safely. I
               advised Dep. Waltz of my opinion and he completed a search
               warrant for a blood draw. Pullman Fire Department responded to
               PPD for the blood draw. I provided the Paramedic (Mark Sugden)
               with the blood draw kit. I watched as Sugden opened the kit and
               removed the two vials. I watched as Sugden swabbed the crook of
               Duncan's left arm with an iodine solution. I watched as Sugden
               drew blood into the two grey top vials from the blood draw kit
               at 0215 hours. Sugden and I labeled the vials. I collected the
               blood draw kit and returned to WSUPD with the kit and logged it
               into evidence to be sent to the lab for testing. See supplement
               for complete details of the evaluation. I certify and declare

               having an asthma attack. We responded to the 6th floor of
               Perham Hall and contacted the patient a Daniel Giday. He was in
               the laundry room lying on the floor. He was covered in vomit
               and was dry heaving. As Daniels spoke to he there was a very
               strong odor of intoxicating beverages coming from his breath. I
               asked him how much he had to drink and he said a fifth of
               vodka. His speech was slurred. As we were waiting for medics to
               arrived I could hear him wheezing. He stated several times he
               was having a hard time breathing. Daniels rolled him on his
               side and told him to stay there. He began trying to get up, but
               fell back down. Daniels told him to stay on the floor several
               times, but eventually had to hold him down to keep him from
               harming himself. Medics arrived and determined he need to be
               transported to PRH. When we got him on the stretcher he began
               fighting with EMS personal. IN the ambulance he had to be put
               into restraints. Cpl Daniels rode in the ambulance to PRH and I
               met them there. It took 3 hospital staff, Cpl Daniels and
               myself and several EMS personal to put him in restraints. When
               we cleared he was still fighting with the restraints. Nothing

               0118 hrs Cougar Security units advised Whitcom of a possibly
               intoxicated male near Regents Hall. Upon my arrival I was told
               the male, later identified as Shaunveer S Sandhu (12-13-94)
               appeared to be intoxicated and was previously sitting outside
               on the steps of Regents Hall. Sandhu later got up and walked
               inside of Regents Hall and into the dining center while
               stumbling. I entered Regents Hall and as I was walking into the
               dining center Cougar Security units pointed Sandhu out. I began
               to walk after him while noting he was staggering as he was
               walking towards the exit. I contacted him prior to exiting and
               asked him what was going on. Sandhu, who was holding a small
               container of french fries, was swaying approximately 4-5 inches
               to each side as we spoke, mumbled something I could not
               understand. I asked him again what was going on at which point
               he told me he was going home. When asked where his residence
               was located, Sandhu pointed off towards the direction of
               Beasley Coliseum. After asking him several more times for the
               exact location I was eventually told he resides in room 409 of
               Perham Hall. Sandhu and I continued to speak at which point I
               noticed he appeared to be under the age of 21 and had the odor
               of intoxicants coming from his breath as he spoke. I asked him
               for his drivers license at which point he pulled his wallet. As
               he opened his wallet I could see his Washington State Drivers
               License in the flap, yet he began to slowly look at his hand
               before eventually starting to put his wallet away. I asked him
               again to see his drivers license and pointed out where it was
               located. Sandhu looked at it and his french fries as if
               confused at what to do. I eventually obtained his drivers
               license, which showed his age as 20, and asked him him how much
               he had to drink. Sandhu told me he had made a terrible mistake
               earlier, but was going to take full responsibility for his
               actions. We discussed this at which point he later explained he
               had been contacted previously for underage drinking. He went on
               to tell me he had been walking home from the greek row area
               where he had been at a fraternity live out. He admitted to
               having consumed alcohol before walking back to his residence,
               at which point he was seen by Cougar Security units. We spoke
               about the decisions he had made and I warned him about being

               before he was released to return to his residence. I watched
