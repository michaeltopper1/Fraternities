               the stairwell and found nobody. He told me that he already
               reset the alarm. I did not identify the employee. No emergency,

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1731 SYNOPSIS: Barrestt was cited and
               released for failure to transfer vehicle title within 45 days.
               Horner was issued an infraction for failure to wear a helmet.

               96 Cite & Release Fail to Transfer Title 5Z0215362 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 04-13-15 at about 0855 hours I was on patrol
               travelling northbound on N. Fairway when I observed a moped
               travelling southbound near the Student Recreation Center. The
               moped caught my attention because I noticed the passenger was
               not wearing a helmet. I turned around to stop the moped and
               noticed that the driver had already pulled into the tennis
               courts parking lot. I pulled in behind the moped, WA/1A6731,
               and activated my emergency lights. I contacted the driver and
               passenger. The driver, Luke N. Barrett, said that he knew why I
               was stopping them and apologized for not having a helmet for
               his passenger. I asked the passenger for his identification and
               he gave me his WSU Cougar Card identifying him as Austin C.
               Horner. He provided a birthday of 02-15-96. I returned to my
               patrol car to run Horner's information and was notified by
               Whitcom that the moped registration expired 08-17-2013. I
               checked Horner's information and returned to speak to the
               driver. I asked him about the expired registration. He said
               that he was sure his dad renewed the tabs and he must have them
               at home. I told him they have not been renewed and asked who
               the vehicle should be registered to. He gave me his father's
               name, which was not the same as the registered owner, Michael
               Nagele. I asked Barrett who Michael was and he said that is who
               they bought the moped from about a year ago in Spokane. Barrett
               told me that he thought his dad took care of everything and
               that he has the title for the moped at his dorm. I explained to
               Barrett that the title needed to be transferred into either his
               or his dad's name within 45 days of purchase. I asked Barrett
               for his identification, which he provided. I issued Barrett a
               criminal citation for RCW 46.12.650.7 for Failure to transfer
               title within 45 days. I explained the citation to him and gave
               him a copy. I also explained to him how to resolve this issue.
               I issued Horner an infraction for RCW 46.37.530 for failure to
               wear a helmet. I explained the infraction to him and gave him a
               copy. I then provided a courtesy transport from the tennis
               courts to Perham Hall for Horner. Video was downloaded to the
               s: drive. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 14th day of April,

    Narrative: RVWD: 316 / OFC: Olmstead/339 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY
               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1742 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched
               to the report of the odor of marijuana in Stephenson East.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Gregory J. Witkowski /
               03-09-1996 Warned Poss. of Marijuana 2. Matthew H. Reynolds /
               07-19-1996 Warned Poss. of Marijuana NARRATIVE: On 04-13-2015
               at about 2016 hrs I was dispatched to a report of the odor of
               marijuana originating from Stephenson East #1225, located at
               1265 SE Stadium Way. Officer Welter and I arrived on scene and
               contacted several hall staff members in the hallway, including
               the complainant, Hannah M. Mitchell (DOB 09-09-1985). Mitchell
               is the hall director for McEachern Hall. Mitchell stated that
               she had already contacted the occupants of the room, and they
               were waiting inside. I knocked on the door, and it was answered
               by Gregory J. Witkowski (DOB 03-09-1996) and Matthew H.
               Reynolds (DOB 07-19-1996). Witkowski and Reynolds are the
               residents of the room. Witkowski is 19 years old, and Reynolds
               is 18 years old. They were the only occupants of the room. The
               odor of marijuana was apparent when the door to room was
               opened, and I could detect an obvious odor of marijuana
               originating from inside the room. Reynolds admitted to smoking
               marijuana inside the room with a pipe. Witkowski had not been
               smoking marijuana inside the room. Upon further investigation,
               I determined that Reynolds and Witkowski were in possession of
               a small amount of green vegetable material (GVM) in a plastic
               bag and a pipe. The GVM appeared to be marijuana and smelled
               like fresh marijuana. Reynolds and Witkowski both claimed
               responsibility and ownership of the marijuana and the pipe.
               Reynolds and Witkowski were cooperative, and I explained to
               them that I would not be taking any enforcement action.
               Reynolds and Witkowski agreed to voluntarily dispose of the GVM
               in the nearby restroom toilet, which they did. Reynolds and
               Witkowski said they would dispose of the pipe. Officer Welter
               and I cleared the scene. No further action at this time.
               Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this __13__ day of __April___, 2015,
