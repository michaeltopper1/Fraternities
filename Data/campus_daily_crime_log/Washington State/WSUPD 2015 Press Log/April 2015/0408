               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1631 SYNOPSIS: Complainant reported
               being harassed by a former friend at the Rec Center. He did not
               want any charges filed but requested an officer contact the
               subject and instruct them to stop. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Christobal J. Ramirez/092091 Warned Threatening
               2. NARRATIVE: On 04/08/15 at about 1037 hrs Dispatch advised of
               a subject who was in the lobby wanting to report a harassment.
               I contacted the complainant, Efren M. Ramos (112491). He told
               me he was in the rec center at about 2020 hrs working out when
               another male, Christobal J. Ramirez (092091) came up to him.
               Ramos did not know what, if anything, Ramirez said to him at
               that time because Ramos had headphones in. A moment later
               Ramirez pushed Ramos on the shoulder so he took his headphones
               out. Ramirez said "Next time I see you I'll rip your face off"
               and left. A short time later Ramirez returned and said " I'm
               gonna fucking kill you, I'll break your neck". Ramos said he
               use to be best friends with Ramirez but had not seen him in a
               couple years. Ramos did not appear to be frightened by the
               comments and told me he was not really scared of Ramirez but
               was concerned with what he (Ramos) might do if Ramirez came
               back. Ramos said he use to be involved in fights and did not
               want that to happen again. Ramos said he didn't want Ramirez
               arrested or charged with any crime. He asked that I contact
               Ramirez and tell him not to contact Ramos any more. Ramos did
               not have any contact information for Ramirez. I provided Ramos
               with my business card and instructed him to call if he had any
               further problems with Ramirez. I attempted to contact Ramirez
               on the phone after locating his information in ZZUSIS. I left a
               message requesting he call me back. At about 1120 hrs I
               attempted to contact Ramirez again on the phone and a female
               answered. Initially she did not say anything and there was only
               silence on the phone. Once I said hello she responded and I
               asked to speak with Ramirez. She hesitated and said she thought
               I had the wrong number. I could hear her speaking to a male in
               the background. I told her this was the number on file for him
               and again I could hear her speaking with a male in the
               background but could not tell what was being said. She then
               hung up without saying anything. I called back and no one
               answered. I left another voice mail requesting Ramirez call me.
               I instructed him that in the mean time he should not have any
               contact with Ramos. I have yet to receive any contact from
               Ramirez. More to follow. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the

               dispatched to a report of a vehicle (Wa. 506MYN) which had been
               damaged by another vehicle's door. I was asked to contact the

               by phone and upon reaching her was told the following. Booth
               explained she had parked her vehicle in the Green Parking lot
               just off of North Fairway Ln and Ferdinand's Ln around 1540
               hrs. When she returned around 1700 she noticed a blue Ford

               to tell me this vehicle had been parked next to her vehicle and
               due to it's angle was concerned it may have struck her vehicle.
               Booth approached her vehicle and told me she noticed a white
               door mark on her door and tried to get a photo of the license
               plate of the Ford as it was driving away. I told Booth I would
               like to see her vehicle and she agreed to meet me at her
               vehicle. Upon my arrival I noticed a white paint transfer onto
               Booth's vehicle. I began to take photos of the damage, which I
               estimated to be around $60.00, at which point she handed me her
               cell phone. On the screen of the phone I saw a photo of the
               Ford, Booth believed had caused the damage. I noticed the
               license plate was not visible, yet the vehicle appeared to be a
               blue Ford Excursion. At noticing this I explained to Booth I
               did not believe the Ford had caused the damage to her vehicle.
               I went on to explain the color did not match the paint transfer
               found on her vehicle and asked her if she had noticed any other
               vehicle parked near her when she pulled into the lot. She told
               me she had been parked near another Toyota 4-Runner which she
               described as being lighter in color. I told her that would make
               more sense based upon what I was seeing on her vehicle. We
               continued to discuss this vehicle, but Booth could not provide
               any additional information on the vehicle or its drivers. I
               gave Booth my business card along with the case number for
               reference and asked to her to give me a call if she was
               contacted by someone claiming responsibility for the damage or
               if she located the vehicle responsible. She told me she would
               and I cleared a short time later. I returned to the WSU Police
               Department and downloaded the photos taken to this case and
               completed the necessary paperwork before clearing the call.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 8th day of April, 2015, in
