               at approximately 0900 hours I was stopped behind the
               defendant's vehicle (WA AIX6666) at a red light facing south at
               NE Stadium Way and NE Wilson Rd. I ran the vehicle plate since
               the tabs displayed showed expired 03/2015. The vehicle return
               came back as expired 03/22/15. I ran the registered owner, Chun
               L. YU, and his return came back as suspended. I activated my
               emergency lights and stopped the vehicle on NE Wilson at the
               French Ad building. I activated my VieVu camera and contacted
               the driver. Asst. Chief Hansen arrived on scene around this
               time. I introduced myself to the driver and advised him the
               reason for the stop and told him the stop was being recorded. I
               asked the driver if the vehicle belonged to him and he said it
               did. I explained to him that his license was suspended. I asked
               for his license, which he provided, identifying him as Chun L.
               Yu 11/24/86, and I confirmed that he was indeed suspended. I
               explained to Yu that he was going to receive a citation for the
               offense. I asked Yu if he could contact someone to move his
               vehicle since he was not legally parked. Yu said his friends
               did not know how to drive a manual. I told Yu that an officer
               could park the vehicle if he was ok with that, which he said he
               was. I told Yu that he was under arrest, advised him of his
               right to counsel, and reminded him that he was being recorded.
               Yu said he understood. I issued Yu a citation for DWLS while
               Ofc. Stewart arrived on scene and parked Yu's vehicle in a
               parking stall. I explained the citation to Yu, gave him a copy,
               and told him he was free to go. All officers cleared the scene.
               I returned to WSUPD and downloaded by video to the computer.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury

               NARRATIVE: On 04/02/15 at approximately 1004 hours I was
               dispatched to a non-injury collision that occurred on NE Cougar
               Way at NE D St. I responded and found the vehicles and drivers
               in the back parking lot of WSU Parking Services. I asked if
               anyone was injured and all present said they were not. I asked
               where the collision occurred and I was told the collision
               occurred on D St. at the exit of the parking lot for Parking
               Services. I radioed Sgt. Sorem (PPD) and asked if he wanted me
               to handle the call and he said I could handle the collision. I
               spoke with the parties involved and learned the following (from
               all subjects present). Schuler was exiting the parking lot and
               attempting to turn left onto NE D St. Schuler did not see
               Bailey traveling south on NE D St. and turned in front of him.
               Bailey struck the front driver's side of Schuler's vehicle.
               Both vehicles sustained well over $1000 of damage. Both drivers
               moved their cars from the road so they were not blocking the
               lanes of travel. Looking at debris in the roadway as well as
               damage to both vehicles, everything I was told seemed correct.
               I took photos of the vehicles and roadway. I noticed there was
               a vehicle (WA 652YPM) parked illegally along NE D St. The
               vehicle was parked within 5 feet of the curb cut (which was
               within a yellow curb) on the north side of the Parking Services
               parking lot. This is the direction in which Schuler was
               turning. I asked if this vehicle was parked in the same
               location when the collision occurred and all parties said it
               was. I radioed PPD's parking services and advised them of the
               illegally parked vehicle. I provided both parties with an
               exchange of information which contained the case number and my
               information. All parties present said they were wearing their
               seatbelts. I asked for the driver's to collect the vehicle
               debris (which was already moved out of the roadway) and to
               throw it away. No infractions issued. Photos saved to the case.
               Please forward to PPD. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the

               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 04-02-
               15 at approximately 1726 hours Cpl. Daniels and I were
               dispatched to the report of $2.00 stolen out of Rogers Hall
               lost and found, located at 1355 SE Olympia Ave. Cpl. Daniels
               and I arrived on scene. I contacted the complainant, Ethan C.
               Roemeling (DOB 10-06-93), who told me two one dollar bills were
               stolen out of the lost and found. Roemeling told me the lost
               and found is located behind the front desk. Roemeling believes
               the money was taken on 03-31-15 at about 0700 hours because one
               of the custodians accidentally left the door to the front desk
               open. Roemeling said on 03-31-15 at about 0800 the money was
               noticed missing, when front desk staff took an inventory of the
               lost and found, and everything was accounted for except two one
               dollar bills. Roemeling told me there were other things of
               value in the lost and found that were not taken. Roemeling said
               the door to the front desk requires a key swipe to gain access,
               and his supervisor did not mention any of the door swipes to
               appear out of the ordinary. I asked Roemeling if they think the
               custodian may have taken the money, and he said no. I asked
               Roemeling if there was anyone they thought may have taken the
               money, and he said no. I asked Roemeling to show me the lost
               and found. I took photographs of the lost and found, and I have
               attached them to Spillman. Cpl. Daniels and I cleared the
               scene. No further investigation. No suspects or leads at this
               time. My Vievu camera was activated, and the video has been
               downloaded into the permanent digital evidence folder. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of

               opening his driver side door and hitting another vehicle in the
               green 2 lot behind Cleveland Hall, located at 1155 East College
               Ave. Dispatch advised the complaint, Christopher B. Chapman
               (DOB 03-23-80), saw a male get out of a gray, 2007 Volkswagen
               Touareg (WA Lic. #AGX3956) and hit the passenger side of a
               blue, 1996 Mazda MX5CV (WA Lic. #AKX3103) when he opened his
               driver's side door. Cpl. Daniels and I arrived on scene. The
               Volkswagen was parked about a foot to the left of the parking
               space, and really close to the passenger side of the Mazda. I
               could not see any new damage to the passenger side of the
               Mazda. I took photographs of both the vehicles and I have
               attached them to Spillman. I left business cards on both of the
               vehicles with the case number. Cpl. Daniels and I cleared the
               scene. I tried calling the owner of the Mazda, Carl A. Brannen
               (DOB 02-28-58), on the phone but he did not answer so I left
               him a voicemail. I later called Chapman on the phone, and I
               asked him what happened. Chapman told me he watched the driver
               of the Volkswagen throw his driver side door into the Mazda and
               then started to walk away as if nothing happened. Chapman told
               me he confronted the male about doing that, and the male said
               "oh well". I told Chapman I was still trying to contact the
               owner of the Mazda. Chapman told me the owner of the Mazda
               called him. Chapman had left a note on Brannen's Mazda with his
               phone number. Chapman said Brannen told him don't worry about
               it, it's an old car. Brannen also told Chapman there was no new
               damage. report not finished................ I certify and

               released for DWLS 3rd degree. Warnings issued for speeding and
               expired registration. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               Sarah L. Price/082786 Cite/release DWLS 3rd degree 5Z0173317 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 04/02/15 at about 2212 hrs I was driving
               southbound on Stadium Way passing N Fairway Rd. when I noticed
               a vehicle that was traveling northbound on Stadium Way. The
               vehicle, WA AKN2937, caught my attention because it appeared to
               be traveling faster than the posted 20 MPH speed limit. I
               activated my police traffic radar unit (vh 7) which emitted a
               high pitched audio doppler tone. The tone was steady in pitch.
               I observed a display of 30 MPH on the radar unit. The vehicle
               was the only moving vehicle in the radar field at the time of
               the readings and the readings were consistent with my visual
               observation of the vehicle's speed. The calibration of the
               radar unit was checked both before and after the stop by the
               use of factory certified tuning forks. The radar unit was found
               to be in proper working order. I turned around and initiated a
               traffic stop on the vehicle, turning on my overhead lights. The
               vehicle stopped on Stadium Way near Beasley Coliseum. I
               contacted the driver, Sarah L. Price (082786), and told her the
               reason for the stop and the stop was being recorded. I asked
               Price for her driver's license, vehicle registration, and proof
               of insurance. She provided me with her registration and
               driver's license. She could not find her current proof of
               insurance. I returned to my patrol vehicle and ran Prices'
               driver's information on my MDC. The driver's return indicated
               her driving status was DWLS 3rd degree for an unpaid ticket. I
               returned to the vehicle and asked Price to step out so I could
               speak with her. Initially she did not want to but she
               eventually did as requested. I had her move to the nearby
               sidewalk and asked if she had an unpaid ticket in Spokane and
               she said yes. I told her her driver's license was suspended.
               She said she did not know her driver's license was suspended.
               She told me she changed address but did not update the address
               on her driver's license. She said she had not checked the mail
               at her previous address in a while. I told Price she was under
               arrest for DWLS 3rd degree and placed her in handcuffs (double
               locked). Price became very agitated and upset. Arguing and
               yelling at me about being arrested for a suspended license when
               she didn't know it was suspended. I advised Price again she was
               being recorded and told her I would read her her Constitutional
               Rights after searching her then explain everything to her.

               Price continued to yell at Officer Whitman and I. I attempted
               to read her Constitutional Rights to her but she interrupted me
               and would not let me explain. She continued to yell at us,
               saying she knew she had tickets that were preventing her from
               renewing her vehicle registration, which expired in December
               2014. Eventually I had to read her Constitutional Rights to her
               over her talking because it became clear she was not going to
               stop. I asked if she understood her rights and after several
               attempts to get a response she told me she understood her
               rights. I explained to Price it was her responsibility to
               update her address with the DOL and since she had not done so
               she had not received the notice of suspension that was sent to
               the address listed on her driver's license. I issued Price
               criminal citation #5Z0173317 for DWLS 3rd degree. I explained
               the citation to her and she was released. I gave her a verbal
               warning for the expired vehicle registration and speeding.
               Price was argumentative throughout the contact. Her vehicle was
               moved to a legal parking spot at Streit Perham Hall at her
               request. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 03 day of April,
               2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               approximately 0020 Cpl. Daniels and I were on foot patrol in
               the area of Cougar Way near Smith Gym when I noticed two (2)
               females walking eastbound down Cougar Way. I could see both
               females staggering side to side while walking on Cougar Way. As
               the females got closer they both appeared to be under the age
               of 21. I told both of the females I needed to talk to them. I
               asked them if they were 21, and they said no. I asked them if
               they had been drinking, and they said no. My Vievu camera was
               activated and I told both of them I was recording. I asked them
               if they would be willing to take a voluntary breath test, and
               they said no. Both females were later identified as Lacy J.
               Herman (DOB 06-29-96) and Christin A. Ostlund (DOB 01-23-95). I
               noticed Herman had bloodshot and watery eye's and I could smell
               the odor of intoxicants coming from her breath. While I was
               talking with them I noticed Herman continued to sway in a
               circular motion. I noticed Ostlund had watery and sleepy
               looking eye's, and I could smell the odor of intoxicants coming
               from her breath. Ostlund kept trying to say she did not have
               her driver's license on her, but Cpl. Daniels told her to look
               in her purse. While Ostlund was digging through her purse I
               noticed a silver can, which appeared to be a beer can. When I
               questioned Ostlund about it she told me there was no can. Cpl.
               Daniels told her to pull the can out of her purse, and Ostlund
               eventually took out an unopened can of Busch Light and set it
               on the ground. I told both Ostlund and Herman I would be
               forwarding charges to the Whitman County Prosecuting Attorney's
               Office for MIP. Cpl. Daniels explained to them there may or may
               not be criminal charges depending on what the Attorney's Office
               decides to do. Cpl. Daniels told Ostlund to pour her beer out
               in the street. Ostlund had trouble keeping her balance while
               picking up the beer can from the ground. Ostlund poured the
               beer out, and we cleared the scene. No further action. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of

               found a bong and a backpack on the stairs between basketball
               courts behind Orton Hall. I responded and spoke to Cougar
               Security at the basketball courts. They said they were
               patrolling the area when the saw five or six people in the
               stairwell between the basketball courts. They told the people
               in the stairwell that they were not supposed to be on the
               courts after hours. They group left the area and walked in the
               direction of Rogers Hall or the Stephenson Complex. Cougar
               Security checked the stairwell and found a backpack and a bong
               there. They shouted towards the group, that was already on the
               other side of the fence, and asked them if they wanted their
               backpack. They group hurried away and did not answer Cougar
               Security. I checked the outside of the backpack for any sort of
               identifying marks or names, there were none. I looked inside
               the backpack for identification, and found none. Inside the
               backpack was a plastic bag contain green vegetable material,
               that based on my training and experience was marijuana. There
               was also a glass container that had a plastic bag in it that
               contained marijuana. The bong was made of clear glass and had
               burnt marijuana in it. I collected the bong and the backpack,

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Boyd/335 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1537 SYNOPSIS: Subject was contacted for
               MIP Exhibiting. Incident sent to student conduct only. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Allison M. Roland/042596 Warned
               MIP Exhibiting 2. NARRATIVE: On 04/03/15 at about 0149 hrs I
               was driving westbound on Cougar Way when I noticed two females,
               later identified as Allison M. Roland and Haley M. McCann,
               walking eastbound along Cougar Way from Thatuna Rd. They caught
               my attention because McCann appeared to be helping Roland
               maintain her balance as they walked. They both appeared to be
               under the age of 21. I stopped and contacted them as they
               reached the entrance to the library parking garage on Cougar
               Way. I asked if they could stop so I could talk to them. McCann
               initially said they were ok but Roland agreed to stop so McCann
               did as well. McCann said Roland was just upset because she had
               an argument with her boyfriend. Roland denied consuming
               alcohol. I asked if Roland would allow me to look at her eyes
               so I could make sure she had not been consuming alcohol. She
               agreed and I administered a horizontal gaze nystagmus test. I
               observed Roland had bloodshot and watery eyes, and a lack of
               smooth pursuit. I could smell the odor of intoxicants on her
               breath as I administered the test. As I was administering the
               test McCann made several statements about how this was "not
               fair" because Roland's boyfriend had cheated on her. It was
               clear Roland had been consuming alcohol but was not as
               intoxicated as she initially appeared. Roland provided me her
               name and date of birth, which I confirmed through Dispatch. The
               information provided confirmed she was under 21. McCann also
               provided her information. I advised Roland I would not be
               forwarding any criminal charges but I would be sending the
               incident to student conduct. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               03 day of April, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.
