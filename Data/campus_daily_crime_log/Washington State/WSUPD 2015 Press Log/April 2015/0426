               arrival, I contacted a white male who I identified as Kenton A.
               Dow (01-26-95). Dow said he is a life guard who just exited the

               to check the chemicals in the SRC pool area. Lucas was able to
               dis-arm the alarm. Corporal Edwards and I cleared. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2025 SYNOPSIS: 3 women reported seeing a
               male "Beating" and throwing a dog to the ground then "Throw"
               the dog into a silver SUV. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR#
               1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 04-26-15, at approximately 1212 hours, I
               was dispatched to the parking lot behind the Residence Inn,
               located at 1255 NE North Fairway Road for and animal problem.
               Dispatch advised me the reporting party, Kelly M. Cooper (06-
               01-86) had witnessed a male hitting and kicking a dog before
               putting it into a Ford SUV (WA/319YAS). I responded to the
               Residence Inn parking lot and located the Ford SUV (WA/319YAS).
               I exited my patrol vehicle and walked toward the SUV. I could
               hear a dog barking and saw a dog in the back of the SUV. I
               could not fully see into the SUV as there was dark tint on the
               windows, but it appeared as if the dog was able to walk while
               in back of the SUV. A female; later identified as Rima Sanders
               (09-04-67), approached me in the parking lot. She witnessed a
               male "Beating" a black lab on top of the hill that is behind
               the parking lot of the Residence Inn. Sanders said two Hispanic
               males were playing with a black lab in the parking lot. She
               said they were throwing a tennis ball and letting the lab chase
               the ball in the lot. She said one of the males appeared to be
               the dog's owner and was also commanding the dog to sit and lay
               down. She said this male was wearing a red hoody sweatshirt and
               dark basketball shorts. She said approximately 15 minutes later
               she looked out of her 4th floor hotel window again and saw the
               two men and the dog were up the dirt hill behind the parking
               lot. She said the males who was wearing the red hoody
               sweatshirt and dark basketball shorts then flipped the dog over
               his front and pinned the dog by sitting aside the dog. She said
               he began hitting the dog (at least 4 times) in the dogs'
               face/muzzle, with his closed fist. She said there appeared to
               be a lot of force used to hit the dog as the male was drawing
               his fist to his shoulder before swinging down to punch the dog.
               The male then took one of the dogs' front legs and began
               bending it backwards as if to break the leg. After bending the
               leg backwards, the male then dragged the dog behind a shrub and
               she lost sight of what the male was doing to the dog. About a
               minute or two later the male moved from behind the shrub and
               tried to toss the dog over his shoulder. She said the male was
               unsuccessful so he opted to carry the dog in his arms down the
               hillside. Upon reaching the Ford SUV, the male "Threw" the dog
               in the back with the windows closed. The male then got into a 4
               door sedan with the other male and drove away. Sanders said the

               male who was with the apparent dog owner was only involved with
               exercising the dog. She said he was on the hill with the dog
               and its owner, but walked away when the beating began. I
               thanked her for telling me what happened and asked her if she
               would be willing to provide a written statement as to what she
               observed. She said she would and did so. As I was speaking with
               Sanders, Kelly M. Cooper (06-01-86) approached me in the
               parking lot and said she had witnessed a black lab being beaten
               by a male. Cooper said she had been called into one of the 3rd
               floor hotel rooms by one of her house keepers, who stated
               "Someone is beating their dog". Cooper looked out of the window
               and said she saw an Asian male, probably 20-25 years old
               pinning his dog on the ground. She said the man then picked up
               the dog and slammed him to the ground. She said the man then
               pulled the dog back to its feet using its leash around its neck
               before picking him up again. This time the male grabbed the dog
               around the neck and slammed him down by its throat. The man
               then pinned the dog and punched it hard in the face. She said
               the man picked the dog up and threw down again. The male then
               picked the dog up and packed it over his shoulder down the hill
               and "Threw" it in the back of a gray Ford SUV. She said she
               reported the license plate to Whitcom. She said the Asian male
               then got into another car; which she described as a silver
               Mitzubishi, and drove away with another Asian male. I asked
               Cooper if she would be willing to provide a written statement
               as to what she observed. She said she could and said she would
               also have the other house keeper who witnessed the beating of
               the dog, Aubrey Schuman, fill out a statement. In Schuman's
               statement, she said she initially witnessed two guys playing
               with their dog on the hillside. She said all looked friendly at
               first, but the guy in the red sweatshirt got more and more
               rough. She said he picked the dog up only by the collar and
               carried it by its collar a few places in the other direction.
               She said he flung the dog to the ground and sat on it. She said
               the male was yelling and then started to punch the dog
               repeatedly (maybe 5-6 times) in its face. She then walked away
               to get her supervisor, Kelli Cooper. When she and Cooper came
               back to the window the male was still picking the dog up and
               hitting it a couple more times. She said the male then picked
               the dog up and carried it to the car. According to RCW
               16.52.207 (1) A person is guilty of animal cruelty in the
               second degree if, under circumstances not amounting to first
               degree animal cruelty, the person knowingly, recklessly, or
               with criminal negligence inflicts unnecessary suffering or pain
               upon an animal. I called Wendy Lierman from the Whitman County
               Prosecutor's Office and gave her a senopsis as to what I
               learned regarding the case. She advised I document the case and
               forward it to her office for RCW 15.52.207 Animal Cruelty in
               the second degree. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this ____ day of

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2026 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched to a
               report of two individuals on the roof of the Compton Union
               Building smoking marijuana. The individuals were contacted and
               warned. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Michael C. Ehde

               Khalifa / 01-31-1996 Warned Possession of Marijuana NARRATIVE:
               On 04-26-2015 at about 1559 hrs I was dispatched to a report of
               two individuals smoking marijuana on the roof of the Compton
               Union Building (CUB), located at 1500 NE Terrell Mall. Sergeant
               Jacobson and I arrived on scene and determined that the
               individuals had accessed the roof from an open window in the
               Student Entertainment Board office, which was room #304. I
               looked out the window and observed two males on the roof, who
               were later identified as Michael C. Ehde (DOB 11-13-1991) and
               Julian A. Khalifa (DOB 01-31-1996). I saw that Ehde and Khalifa
               had ducked down and were crawling along the roof away from the
               open window. They then stood up and began to run westbound
               along the roof. I verbally ordered them to stop running and to
               return to the window. They both complied with my orders. Ehde
               and Khalifa returned and climbed back into the office through
               the window, at my direction. Ehde was 23 years old, and Khalifa
               was 19 years old. Both Ehde and Khalifa identified themselves
               as WSU students and employees of the Student Entertainment
               Board. Ehde and Khalifa admitted to smoking marijuana on the
               roof. Ehde explained that they had just wrapped up the events
               for the Springfest weekend and had been somewhat stressed out.
               Ehde said they decided to go out onto the roof to smoke
               marijuana. Upon further investigation, I determined that Ehde
               was in possession of a small amount of green vegetable material
               (GVM) in a plastic bag and a small bong. The GVM appeared to be
               marijuana and smelled like fresh marijuana. I detected the odor
               of marijuana originating from both Ehde and Khalifa. Both Ehde
               and Khalifa were cooperative. I counseled both of them for
               their behavior and explained to them that I would not be taking
               any enforcement action. Ehde agreed to voluntarily dispose of
               the GVM in the nearby restroom toilet, which he did. Ehde also
               disposed of his bong in an outside trash receptacle. Sergeant
               Jacobson and I cleared the scene. No further action at this
               time. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this _27__ day of

               hinge. Several screws are drilled through the plastic to hold
               the door to the hinge. The screws were broken out of the
               plastic of the door. I slide the door back on the hinge and saw
               the door hit the door of the machine next to it exerting
               pressure on the hinge and plastic around the hinge screws. It
               appears that overtime the plastic around the screws weekend and
               broke. It appears to be poor manufacturing and design of the
               doors. Kelsey Holtzlider called and reported a door of one of
               her machines had been torn off in the third floor laundry. I
               responded and spoke with Holtzlider. The machine was on the end
               and its door could open up and swing until it hit the corner of
               the machine also putting pressure on the hinge area. This also
               appeared to be damage caused by the combination of high use,
               poor design and manufacturing. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this ____ day of
               _____________, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: BEJ/314 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #:15-W2031 SYNOPSIS: I responded to the second
               floor of Perham Hall for a report of malicious mischief. Upon
               arriving I spoke to the Rp who stated rooms 234, 224 and 236
               all had been damaged. The Rp stated the damage occurred between
               last semester and this morning. The damage was being reported
               because the residence didn't want to be charged for the damage.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 26
               April 2014 at about 1920 hours, I was dispatched to a malicious
               mischief on the second floor of Perham Hall. Upon arriving I
               spoke with Nicholas North. North is the resident advisor on the
               second floor. He stated sometime between last night and this
               morning "fucking fag" had been written on the door of room 234
               with a black sharpie. North saw that "I'm a bitch" had been
               scratched into the door of room 236. He then noticed a penis
               had been scratched into the door of room 224 along with other
               scratches to the door. North was not sure when the scratches
               were put in the doors. He had spoken to the residence of the
               rooms who just wanted the damage documented so they wouldn't
               have to pay for the damage. North said the housing trouble
               shooters would come out and sand the doors down. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               ____ day of _____________, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.
