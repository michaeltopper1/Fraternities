               approximately 2200 hours I responded to the area near Thompson
               Hall for the report of a suspicious vehicle which had been
               parked running for an hour. I contacted the occupant of the
               vehicle who stated they were there because they were using the
               Wi-Fi. She stated her boyfriend was inside the Murrow building
               charging his laptop. I asked if they had a permit to enter the
               restricted area and she said no. As I was talking to her, the
               male came out and I advised him I was issuing him a verbal
               warning for failing to obey the traffic control device, sign,
               Do Not Enter. I advised them to go to the CUB next time. They
               left the area and I cleared. I did not identify either subject.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1971 SYNOPSIS: Major water leak at
               Markley Motor Pool Shop. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR#
               1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 04-24-15 at approximately 2224 hours, I was
               traveling on Grimes Way when I heard water spraying as I was
               passing Markley Motor Pool Building. I looked over and could
               see a very large column of water spraying inside the shop area.
               I pulled in and discovered the entire building was flooded. I
               immediately called Fac Ops and requested someone respond to
               shut off the water to the building. I then requested Dennis
               Rovetto be notified and asked for him to respond. After a short
               period of time, Fac Ops arrived and began looking for the water
               shut off. At approximately 2250 hours, the water was shut off.
               By this time, there was approximately two feet of standing
               water inside the shop, and the large roll up garage door was
               bulging outward. We had attempted to release some of the water
               from within by opening multiple doors, but due to the amount of
               water coming in, it continued to flood. After the water was
               shut off and Motor Pool staff arrived to assist, I took
               photographs of some of the damage. Multiple computers appeared
               to be ruined, and the vehicles which were in the shop had been
               flood along with everything else inside. The staff stated they
               would contact EHS due to possible contamination of the water by
               oil. The leak was due to a flange on an approximate 6-8 inch
               high pressure line breaking. I asked Rovetto if he needed any
               further assistance from our department and he said no. All
               units cleared. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 25th day of April, 2015, in

               hours, I was on patrol near the Washington Building when I
               observed a male being carried by two females down Nevada
               towards Stadium Way. I activated my body camera, got out. and
               contacted the group. I could see the male was barely able to
               stand by himself. He was swaying in a very large circular
               motion and he had an extreme odor of intoxicants emitting from
               his breath. I asked him how much he had to drink and he said a
               lot. I asked for his identification and he was identified as
               Matthew Jones. I asked him if he would take a PBT and he said
               yes. A reading of .242 was observed. I had Jones sit down as I
               was afraid he was going to fall over. I asked him several
               questions to determine if he was able to care for himself or if
               he needed medical attention. He was able to answer all
               questions except one correctly. I asked him if he had a
               roommate and he said yes. Jones lives in Stephenson. I asked if
               we could call his roommate and he said yes. I told the females
               they could leave. They had told me they had seen him stumbling
               and didn't really know him. They were just helping him home.
               They left the area. Jones had a hard time finding his roommates
               number on his cell so I asked if I could do it for him and he
               said yes. I found his roommates number and called him. Nick
               answered the phone, but told me he had been drinking. I asked
               if he could find a sober friend to come get Jones and he said
               yes. He asked to call me right back. About two minutes later,
               he called back and said a friend was on his way. About five
               minutes later a male in a vehicle pulled into the parking lot
               and said he would take care of Jones. I advised Jones he was
               not going to be arrested, but would be forwarded to Student
               Conduct. Prior to the friend arriving, I had Jones take another
               PBT test and the result was lower than the first. I did not get
               Nick's full name or identify the male who came and picked up
               Jones. I also did not identify the two females walking with
               Jones. I cleared. I certify and declare under penalty of

               patrol traveling north bound on Spokane St from Stadium Way
               when I observed three subjects walking southbound on the east
               side sidewalk. All three subjects appeared to be under the age
               of 21 and I observed one of the subjects, later identified as
               Joshua Stein was having a difficult time walking. I turned
               around as they were crossing Stadium Way and I could see Stein
               was stumbling side to side as he walked, taking up the entire
               crosswalk and sidewalk going up to the Stephenson Complex. As I
               began to cross Stadium Way, I observed the three take off
               running towards the building. I pulled into the area of
               Stephenson North loading dock and as I got out of my vehicle, I
               yelled at the subjects to stop. I observed Stein got to the
               door his two friends ran into and the door closed leaving him
               locked out. He turned towards me and began walking back in my
               direction. I activated my body camera and asked him why he was
               running. He stated he wasn't. I could see him swaying as he
               stood in front of me and his speech was very slurred. I also
               observed an odor of intoxicants emitting from his breath which
               became stronger as he spoke. I asked for his ID and he provided
               his WA Driver's License. I asked him to zip up his pants as
               they were undone. I asked him how much he had tonight and he
               stated he had nothing. I asked him if he was going to lie to me
               and he said it wasn't a lie cause he hadn't been drinking. I
               advised him he was under arrest for Minor Exhibiting in a
               Public Place and he had the right to an attorney. He was
               handcuffed, the handcuffs were double locked, and I advised him
               he was being recorded by audio and video. I walked him back to
               my vehicle and searched him incident to arrest. Stein wanted to
               argue about the arrest and stated I couldn't search him. I
               advised him he was being searched incident to arrest and he was
               arrested because he was under 21 and intoxicated in public. I
               placed him in the rear of my patrol vehicle while I completed
               his citation. When I was finished, I pulled him out of the
               vehicle and explained the citation to him. I unhandcuffed him
               and provided him his copy of the citation. I advised him he was
               free to go and to pick his stuff up off the patrol car. He
               began to argue with me again and I advised to take his stuff
               and leave. He eventually gathered his belongings and left the

               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1978 SYNOPSIS: Arrested a female
               for minor operating a motor vehicle after consuming alcohol,
               DWLS 3rd, and possession of marijuana under forty grams. Cited

               2. NARRATIVE: On 04/25/15 at about 0124 hours I was driving
               eastbound on Olympia Ave. I observed a vehicle traveling
               westbound at a high rate of speed I activated my Speed
               Measuring Device in moving mode. The SMD emitted a steady high
               pitched audio tone. I saw no other obstructions between my
               location and the vehicle when I obtained the reading. The SMD
               displayed a speed of 28 mph for the vehicle. At the time of the
               reading, the vehicle was alone. The posted speed limit on
               Olympia Ave is 20 MPH. I turned and activated my overhead
               lights and the vehicle (ID/K571065) stopped in the parking lot
               for Olympia Hall. I contacted the driver, Amia D. Padero
               (032096), and informed her the stop was being recorded. I asked
               her for her license, registration and proof of insurance.
               Padero told me she did not have her driver's license with her.
               I then asked how many drinks she had this evening and she said
               "a shot or two". I then asked her if she knew why I stopped her
               and she did not. I told her she was going 28 miles an hour and
               then I asked her if she knew what the speed limit was on
               Olympia Ave and she said 20 miles per hour. I again asked
               Padero for the vehicle registration, and proof of insurance.
               Padero told me the vehicle was her boyfriends. She handed me
               the registration and then stated that her boyfriend does not
               have insurance for the vehicle. I asked Padero for her name and
               date of birth, and she provided both. I returned to my vehicle
               and had dispatch run Padero's name and date of birth. Dispatch
               advised Padero had a warrant out of Adams County for DWLS 3rd,
               they also informed me her Washington State driver's license was
               suspended. I went back to the vehicle and asked Padero if she
               would step out of the vehicle and perform some voluntary field
               sobriety test. She said she would and she exited the vehicle. I
               asked her if there was anything that would keep her from
               completing the tests. She said there was not. I asked if she
               wears glasses or contacts. Padero said she does not. She did
               state she may be a bit cross eyed. I observed Padero's eyes
               were bloodshot and watery, and I could smell an odor of
               intoxicants coming from her. I began the standardized field
               sobriety tests by asking her to stand with her feet together,

               hands at her side, and to stay in that position during the
               first test. The first test is the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus
               test. I explained to Padero that it was an eye test. I
               explained that during the test she needed to follow the tip of
               my pen with her eyes only, and not to move her head. Padero
               said she understood. I observed both of Padero's pupils were
               equal size and there was no resting nystagmus. Her eyes tracked
               equally. I observed a lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes. I
               observed a distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum
               deviation in both eyes. I did not observe onset of nystagmus
               prior to 45 degrees in either eye. I also observed during the
               test that she was swaying from side to side about 2 to 3
               inches. The next test I explained to Padero was the walk and
               turn. I explained to Padero to imagine a line straight out in
               front of her and to place her left foot on that line and then
               place her right foot in front of her left with her heel and toe
               touching. I told her to keep her hands at her sides and to
               maintain that position while I explained the test and not to
               begin the test until I told her to do so. I explained to Padero
               that she was to take nine heel to toe steps along the imaginary
               line. Then when she reached her ninth step to keep that foot
               planted and make a series of small steps to turn around and
               take nine heel to toe steps back along the same line. I
               demonstrated three steps and I also demonstrated the turn and
               then three return steps, explaining that she needed to take the
               full nine steps down and back. I told her that during the test
               she needed to look at her feet while she was walking and count
               her steps out loud. I also told her that once she began the
               test she needed to continue until the test was complete. I
               asked Padero if she had any questions, she did not I told her
               to begin the test. Padero stepped out of the starting position
               once while I was explaining the instructions. She began the
               test and took nine heel to toe steps and then stopped and asked
               which foot she was supposed to keep planted while she turned. I
               told her, her front foot. Padero kept her front foot planted
               and attempted to turn her body on the ball of her foot in one
               motion. She stumbled while she was attempting to turn then
               completed her turn. She then took eight heel to toe steps back
               and said she was done. The next test I explained was the one
               leg stand. I instructed Padero to stand with her feet together,
               hands at her side, and to maintain that position while I
               explained the instructions. I also told her not to begin the
               test until I told her to do so. I asked if she understood she
               said she did. I explained that during this test she was to lift
               the foot of her choice so that her foot was six inches off the
               ground and parallel to the ground, with both legs straight.
               Then she was to count out loud by one thousands, and I
               demonstrated the stance and the counting "one thousand one, one
               thousand two, one thousand three". I explained that during the
               test she needed to keep her hands at her side, she needed to
               look at her foot and to count out loud as demonstrated until I
               told her to stop. I asked if she had any questions, she said
               she did not. I asked her which foot she was going to raise, she
               said she was going to raise her right foot. Padero chose to
               raise her right foot. She lifted her right foot and then asked

               "right here". Padero then put her foot down. She raised it
               again and began to count. She counted to 32 in about 30
               seconds. I asked Padero if she would provide a breath sample
               for the preliminary breath test. I explained that the PBT does
               not replace the evidentiary breath test. Padero said she would.
               I told her to blow on the tube like she was blowing up a
               ballon. She began to blow very softly into the tube. I told her
               she needed to blow harder so she could hear the tone from the
               machine as she blew. Padero continued to blow softly. I tried
               to get a reading from the breath she was providing and the PBT
               would not get a reading. The PBT then showed an error. So I
               asked to use Officer Tiengo's PBT. Padero continued to provide
               inadequate samples. I explained to Padero the test was
               voluntary and she did not have to take the test. Padero said
               she wanted to and I used Officer Tiengo's PBT again. She
               provided the sample to the ALCO Sensor FST (SN#102460) and it
               recorded a reading of .089. I performed the PBT in accordance
               with state toxicologist recommendations and I have been trained
               in using the ALCO Sensor FST PBT. I placed Padero under arrest
               for DUI, placed her in handcuffs(DL), and told her she was
               being audio and video recorded. I read her Miranda warnings
               from my department issued Miranda warnings card. She said she
               understood her rights. I searched her incident to arrest. In
               her front right pants pocket there were two cylindrical
               objects. One was make-up, the other item was an orange tube.
               Based on my training and experience, inside the tube was a
               marijuana cigarette. I reminded Padero of her rights and asked
               what was in the tube. She said it was marijuana but she was
               just holding it for someone else. I put Padero into the back of
               my patrol car I informed Padero there was also a warrant for
               her arrest out of Adams County for DWLS 3rd, but I had not
               confirmed it yet. I later attempted to confirm the warrant and
               Adams County said they could not extradite because their jail
               was too full. Officer Tiengo remained on scene to wait for the
               tow and I transported Padero to Pullman Police Department for
               the BAC. I arrived at Pullman PD and began the BAC with Padero.
               I read Padero her constitutional rights. Padero understood her
               rights and chose not to speak to an attorney. She said she
               would answer my questions. I read Padero the implied consent
               warnings and she signed that she had them read to her at 0225
               hours. I asked Padero if she would submit to a breath test. She
               had questions about what would change if she refused. I re-read
               her the portion about refusal and explained she would still be
               under arrest for DUI. She said she would submit to a breath
               test. I checked Padero's mouth at 0230 hours and found no
               foreign substances. During the BAC test Padero was blowing very
               softly into the instrument. I coached her on the appropriate
               amount and force of breath but she continued to blow very
               softly. The BAC instrument stopped the test and read "invalid
               sample". Following proper BAC protocols I re-checked her mouth
               (0304 hours) and observed her for fifteen more minutes and then
               began the test again. Padero provided a breath sample of .068
               at 0325 hours, and a sample of .065 at 0327 hours. The breath
               sample was administered in accordance to the methods approved
               by the Washington State Toxicologist pursuant to the Washington

               Administrative Code. Padero was fingerprinted and photographed.
               I provided Padero with the Driver's Hearing Request form, the
               Notice of Hearing/Conditions of Release form, a copy of the
               Breath Test Document, and the Tow/Impound form. I issued Padero
               criminal citations #5Z0541970 and #5Z0541971 and informed her
               she was being cited for minor operating a motor vehicle after
               consuming alcohol, instead of DUI which I originally stated. I
               also informed her she was being cited for DWLS 3rd, and
               possession of marijuana forty grams or less. I gave her a copy
               and released Padero from custody. I returned to the WSU Police
               Department and placed the marijuana cigarette I seized from
               Padero into evidence. On 04/27/15 I processed the marijuana
               cigarette I seized from Padero. The net weight of the marijuana
               in the cigarette was .60 grams. I NIK tested the marijuana
               using NIK test 05 (rcvd 11/04/14)and it tested presumptive
               positive for marijuana. I placed the evidence in locker 15 in
               the evidence room. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 27th day of April,
               2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               5Z0511344 2. NARRATIVE: On April 27, 2015 at approximately 0253
               hours I was driving eastbound on Stadium Way approaching B St
               when my green traffic signal turned red. I came to a stop at
               the intersection. I noticed two vehicles facing southbound on
               Valley Street. There was a truck in the straight lane and an
               Acura MDX in the right turn only lane. When their light turned
               green the Acura speed up quickly, went straight from the right
               turn only lane, cut off the truck, and headed southbound on B
               St. I pulled behind the truck and Acura. The Acura turned left
               onto Harvey St and I activated my emergency lights. The Acura
               continued for a short while before coming to a stop just north
               of Alpha Road. I contacted the driver, Ryan Keith Kauffman
               06/23/93, identified myself, informed the driver I was
               recording, and explained the reason for the stop. While
               standing at the driver's side window I could smell the
               overpowering odor of intoxicants coming from within the car. I
               asked for Kauffman's driver's license, vehicle registration,
               and proof of insurance. As Kauffman looked for his documents
               his movements were very slow and deliberate. As Kauffman handed
               me his registration he said, "I'm sorry um..." Kauffman's words
               were very slow and his voice was very gravelly. I noticed
               Kauffman's eyes were watery and bloodshot. Kauffman's eyelids
               were droopy as well. I asked Kauffman if he could come talk to
               me on the sidewalk. Kauffman slowly exited his car. Kauffman
               then stood next to his open door and I had to ask him to come
               over to the sidewalk. Once on the sidewalk Kauffman was having
               difficulty balancing as he stood still. At one point he
               stumbled slightly to the side while standing still. I asked
               Kauffman how much he had to drink tonight. Kauffman said, "not
               a lot." I asked how much that was for him. Kauffman again said,
               "not a lot." I asked Kauffman to put a number on the drinks he
               had. Kauffman eyes started to tear up and he raised his hands
               to his face. Kauffman then replied, "I don't know man..."
               Kauffman was trying not to cry. Kauffman kept raising his hand
               to his face as if he was going to vomit. I asked Kauffman if he
               was ok and Kauffman said he was just trying to get to his
               friends house. I asked Kauffman if he was willing to do some
               voluntary standardized field sobriety tests. Kauffman shook his
               head and said no. Kauffman began to cry and I told him that he
               was under arrest for DUI and handcuffed (D/L) him. I advised

               Kauffman that he was being audio and video recorded. I walked
               Kauffman over to my patrol car. I had Kauffman by the arm and
               Kauffman was still stumbling. I had to hold on tighter to
               Kauffman to assist him in walking. Once at the car Kauffman was
               searched incident to arrest. Nothing of evidentiary value was
               found. I read Kauffman his Miranda Rights off my department
               issued. I placed Kauffman in the back seat of my patrol car. I
               told Kauffman that his vehicle was going to be towed and wanted
               to know if there was anything in the car he wanted out of it.
               Kauffman did not say anything so I asked if he wanted his
               wallet. Kauffman felt for his wallet. I told Kauffman it was
               still in the car and Kauffman said he did not need it. Sgt.
               Griffin stayed with the vehicle and I transported Kauffman to
               Pullman Police Department for BAC. When I reached Pullman PD,
               Kauffman had somehow got his foot stuck under the cage in my
               car. I was able to free Kauffman and had him exit. I told
               Kauffman that I needed to check his mouth and Kauffman started
               to stall saying something to the effect of, "I think my dad
               said something about not doing this." Kauffman started to ask
               what I would do if I was him and I told Kauffman that I could
               not give him legal advice. I asked Kauffman if he would like me
               to call him an attorney so he could have legal advice. Kauffman
               again said he did not know what to do and kept asking me what I
               thought he should do. I finally decided for Kauffman and called
               him an attorney. I was able to reach public defender Casi
               Scheiling. Kauffman spoke to Scheiling for 20 minutes before I
               entered the room and asked Kauffman if he was still talking to
               Scheling. I asked if I could verify that and Kauffman handed me
               the phone. I asked Scheiling if she needed to speak to Kauffman
               any longer and she said no. I checked the Datamaster and found
               it working properly, with the RFI antenna attached, the mouth
               tube warm to the touch, and a temperature within ranges. At
               0341 hours I checked Kauffman's mouth finding no foreign
               substances. I read Kauffman his Constitutional Rights at 0341
               hours. Kauffman stated he understood his rights and signed he
               understood his rights and decided not to exercise his rights. I
               read Kauffman the Implied Consent Warning for Breath. Kauffman
               said he wanted to read the warnings himself. After he read
               them, Kauffman signed at 0345 hours. Kauffman stated he was
               willing to provide a breath sample. Kauffman first breath
               sample came back invalid sample. I restarted the observation
               time at 0414 hours. After waiting 15 minutes we restarted the
               breath samples. Kauffman provided a breath sample of .208 at
               0433 hours and another sample of .217 at 0436 hours. The breath
               test was administered in accordance to the methods approved by
               the Washington State Toxicologist pursuant to the Washington
               Administrative Code. During the entire DUI process Kauffman's
               emotions were all over the place. At times he was laughing or
               crying or somber. I provided Kauffman a copy of the following
               documents: Driver's Hearing Request, Notice of
               Hearing/Conditions of Release, tow and impound form, and the
               breath test document. Kauffman was issued Sector Citation
               5Z0511344 for RCW 46.61.502 DUI. I explained the citation and
               provided him with his copy. Kauffman was finger printed and
               photographed. Kauffman's vehicle was impounded by Myer's Towing

               our computer screen for an intoxicated female on Cougar Way
               near the soccer fields, located at 1200 NE Cougar Way. Dispatch
               had been talking to a female who sounded intoxicated on the

               tried calling back, but she did not answer. Dispatch was able

               the soccer fields. Cpl. Kuhrt and I responded to the area
               because we had recently passed a male and a female standing on

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1981 SYNOPSIS: Intoxicated male in
               Northside Residence Hall locked himself inside a bathroom and
               was not responding. Officers and medics arrived on scene, and
               male opened the door. Male subject was given courtesy transport
               to his friend's dorm at Rogers Hall. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 04-25-15 at approximately 0323
               hours Cpl. Kuhrt and I were dispatched to the report of an
               alcohol overdose at Northside Residence Hall #374B bathroom,
               located at 1590 NE Cougar Way. Dispatch advised the male
               subject had been vomiting in the bathroom, and he locked the
               door behind him. Dispatch said the male subject was not
               responding when the complainant tried to see if he was okay.
               Cpl. Kuhrt and I arrived on scene. We contacted the
               complainant, Brianne N. Davison (DOB 07-28-96). Davison said
               her friend Ty. A. Leyendekker (DOB 04-23-96) showed up to her
               room and was highly intoxicated. Davison said Leyendekker told
               her he had been drinking 100 proof vodka earlier. Davison said
               he was barely able to stand. Davison said Leyendekker went to
               the restroom to throw up and he locked the door behind him.
               Davison said Leyendekker had been in the restroom for
               approximately 10 minutes so she wanted to check on him. Davison
               said the door was locked and Leyendekker was not responding.
               Cpl. Kuhrt and I knocked on the door to the bathroom multiple
               times, but Leyendekker was not answering. WSU Facilities tried
               to unlock the door, but they were unable to. We could hear
               Leyendekker speaking and turning on the water to the sink.
               However, Leyendekker would not come to the door and open it.
               Pullman Medics arrived on scene and tried to open the door as
               well. We continued to knock and yell for Leyendekker to open
               the door. Eventually, Leyendekker opened the door and he was
               completely naked. Pullman Medics spoke with Leyendekker and
               determined he did not need to go to the hospital if he had
               someone who would be able to watch after him. Pullman Medics
               cleared the scene. Cpl. Kuhrt spoke with Davison to see if she
               was comfortable with letting Leyendekker stay the night in her
               room. Davison said she was not comfortable with him staying
               with her. Davison knew Leyendekker from high school, but she
               does not know him that well. After Leyendekker got dressed, I
               told him he would have to leave Northside Residence Hall. Cpl.
               Kuhrt and I escorted him out of the building. Once we got
               outside, Leyendekker was able to tell us his friend, Jose A.
               Cruz (DOB 01-13-96), lives in Rogers Hall #921. Cpl. Kuhrt and
               I provided Leyendekker a courtesy transport to Rogers Hall. We
