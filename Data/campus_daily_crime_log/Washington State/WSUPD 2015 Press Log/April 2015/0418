               DEPARTMENT CASE #:15-W1824 SYNOPSIS: Responded to a welfare
               check on a subject who appeared to have been beat up. Contacted
               subject and he did not want to report a crime or receive
               medical attention. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 04/18/15 at approximately 0815 hours I was
               dispatched to a welfare check on SE Idaho St. for a subject who
               appeared "bloody". I was in the area and located the subject
               between Owen Science and Stimson Hall. I activated my VieVu
               camera. I contacted the subject and noticed a large abrasion
               over his right eye. I noticed blood on his shirt. I asked the
               subject if he was ok and he said he was. I asked him what
               happened and he said he was beat up. The subject seemed very
               reluctant to provide me with information. I asked if he wanted
               to talk to me about the fight and he said no. I asked if he
               would tell me where it occurred and he said it happened at a
               fraternity. I asked him what fraternity it was and he said he
               did not want to say. I asked if he wanted an ambulance to
               respond to look at his injuries and he said no. As the subject
               spoke with me I could smell the odor of intoxicants on his
               breath and he was swaying in a circular motion. I asked the
               subject where he lived and he said Gannon Hall. I asked the
               subject if he would give me his first and last name. The
               subject told me his name was Sean Watunngwa (which he spelled
               out). I gave Sean my business card and told him to call me if
               he changed his mind and wanted to report the assault. I
               returned to WSUPD and located a Sean T. Watungwa in Spillman.
               There was a photo of Sean and it was the same person. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: DMJ/338 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1827 04/18/15 SYNOPSIS: A male in the
               WSU Student Recreation Center was threatening to kill people in
               the facility. Male taken into protective custody. Building
               searched and cleared. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               DEMENTYEV, Dmitry Protective Custody Threatening (03/24/86) 2.
               NARRATIVE: At about 1147 hours WSU Police were dispatched to
               the WSU Student Recreation Center (SRC) for a male who was
               threatening to kill people. The male suspect was inside the
               building making the threats. Sgt. Jacobson and I responded to
               the area. I was the first responder to arrive on scene. The
               parking lot was full of people and there were people exiting
               the building. I observed adults and children as young as
               toddlers exiting. I estimate a couple of hundred people in the
               area. As I exited my vehicle SRC staff and patrons were
               pointing at a male in a brown jacket running around holding
               what appeared to be a cell phone in his hand above head. Sgt.
               Jacobson arrived just seconds after I did. The male was about
               in the middle of the parking lot near the Blue Phone. The male
               suspect later identified as Dementyev, Dmitry (03/24/86), began
               to run through the parking lot to the west. He was running back
               toward the main entrance of the SRC. Sgt. Jacobson and I
               pursued the subject on foot. As we were chasing him a male ran
               out of the crowd and tackled Dementyev near the bike racks.
               Sgt. Jacobson and I took control of Dementyev while on the
               ground. Sgt. Jacobson and I handcuffed Dementyev behind his
               back. The handcuffs were double locked. Sgt. Jacobson asked
               Dementyev a couple of times if he was injured. Dementyev did
               not respond to the questions. He was speaking in broken English
               and in another language that I could not understand. He did not
               appear to be injured as there were no obvious injuries.
               Dementyev was checked for weapons, he had credit cards,
               identification card, a cell phone, a handkerchief, and keys on
               his person. The cell phone was playing music at a loud volume.
               I stopped the music from playing on the phone. Sgt. Jacobson
               and I placed Dementyev in the back seat of Sgt. Jacobson's
               patrol vehicle. Pullman Police soon arrived on scene to assist.
               A building search team was assembled. Pullman Police Officer
               Engle, Pullman Police Officer Chamberlain and I searched and
               cleared the SRC. Nothing suspicious was found in the building.
               After we cleared the building it was turned back over to SRC
               personnel for occupancy. Sgt. Jacobson transported Dementyev to
               Pullman Regional Hospital for the necessary
               treatment/evaluation as he was in protective custody. I

               immediately met with SRC staff in their Administration office.
               The staff members provided me with both a verbal and written
               account of the incident. I also obtained entry logs for the
               SRC. According to witness the following events occurred: At
               about 1141 hours Dementyev swiped his WSU Cougar Card making
               entry into the SRC. Helena K. McLeod (05/30/96) was working at
               the front desk. She observed Dementyev stop at a turnstile and
               hold his phone playing loud music before swiping his card. She
               watched him enter the facility. Dementyev then walked toward
               two female SRC employees who were walking near the main
               entrance to the weight room. This is only feet away from the
               main SRC entrance. Jamie L. Goodman (02/11/93) and Robyn C.
               Ahrens (06/15/94) told me Dementyev came up very close behind
               them. He put his phone playing loud music up to their ears and
               said "This is for you." They quickly walked away from him as
               Dementyev walked onto the basketball courts. This scared both
               of the women as it was uninvited and unexpected. Nathan L.
               Cherzan (09/06/93), a patron at the SRC was on the basketball
               court. He said Dementyev came up to a group of guys that he was
               playing basketball with. Dementyev was playing music on his
               cell phone. He came up to Cherzan and said "We were all going
               to die" and "WSU is going to die." Cherzan told Dementyev to
               leave. Dementyev walked away as Cherzan reported him to the
               front desk and exited the building. Megan E. Strom (11/09/94)
               was working at the front service desk when she received a
               report of a male in the SRC whoe was telling everyone they were
               going to die. She saw him going towards the climbing wall
               holding his phone above his head and screaming that everyone at
               WSU was going to die. Miguel I. Sotelo (08/03/93) and Jacob T.
               Wright (02/13/93) were in the rear of the SRC at the rock
               climbing wall. They were working on the wall, it was closed to
               patrons. Dementyev came into the area shouting about how they
               are going to die after he (Dementyev) climbs a route up the
               wall. Dementyev challenged everyone to climb. He then picked up
               a climbing rock from the a bucket full of climbing rocks.
               Dementyev held it above his head like he was going to throw it
               at them. Dementyev threw it at the climbing wall, breaking the
               climbing rock. Dementyev was yelling and walked out of the area
               back toward the center of the SRC. Kelsey M Selstead (10/02/92)
               was working as the SRC Facility Manager. She received reports
               of a male telling people that everyone at WSU was going to die.
               She saw Dementyev walking towards the climbing area with his
               hands up in the air. She told staff to begin evacuating the
               facility and called 911. She watched as people were exiting the
               building. Dementyev exited the building walking toward the
               patrons gathering at the Blue light in the main parking lot.
               She said Dementyev approached a group of people as the police
               were arriving on scene. Kyle P. Oliver (03/19/95), a patron at
               the SRC was upstairs when he was instructed to exit the
               facility. As he was leaving he saw the "suspicious guy exit and
               was laughing under his breath, waving his phone in the air."
               Oliver heard Dementyev say "Don't you know me?" and "This is
               great." Oliver followed Dementyev out into the parking lot.
               When Dementyev saw the police arrive he ran. Oliver chased
               Dementyev because he was closer to him than the police. Oliver

               tackled Dementyev and held him down until police arrived.
               Oliver is a Midshipman with UI/WSU Naval ROTC. None of the
               staff members or patron I spoke with saw a weapon displayed.
               They all saw the cell phone in Dementyev hand that was playing
               loud music. As I talked with the witnesses they told me how
               they were still quite shaken from the incident. Some of them
               were visibly shaking and had a hard time writing statements.
               SRC staff provided me with the climbing rock thrown and broken
               by Dementyev. I photographed the item and placed it into
               evidence. The rock is valued at $20.00. I met with Jeff
               Elbracht, Facilities Director and Nicolas Prante, Assistant
               Director, Facilities & Operations before leaving the building.
               Once I cleared the SRC I telephoned Lt. Larsen to update him on
               the incident. I then responded to Pullman Regional Hospital
               where I assisted Sgt. Jacobson. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 18th day of

               Cpl. Kuhrt, Ofc. Whitman, and I were on foot patrol in the area
               of the grey lot by Rogers Hall. We were walking through the
               parking lot, and I could smell the strong odor of burnt
               marijuana in the area. Cpl. Kuhrt noticed a parked blue, 2001
               Chevrolet Tahoe (WA Lic. #AAX6425) nearby with four female
               occupants inside. We contacted the females in the vehicle, who
               were later identified as Elizabeth M. Schuern (DOB 03-12-96),
               Dany I. Franco (DOB 07-27-96), Meggan A. Comstock (DOB 10-03-
               95), and Emily A. Engel (DOB 04-30-96). I asked if any of them
               were over the age of 21, and they all said no. I asked if any
               of them had a medical marijuana card, and they all said no. I
               asked who had been smoking marijuana in the vehicle, and they
               all admitted to doing so. I asked them who the marijuana
               belonged to. They all told me it belonged to all of them. I
               asked who the pipe belonged to, and they told me it belonged to
               all of them as well. They handed me a small purse containing a
               green and blue glass pipe with burnt green vegetable material
               (GVM) residue inside. The purse also contained two small
               plastic bags containing a small amount of GVM shake. The pipe
               and two small plastic bags were seized and later weighed and
               logged into evidence. The green and blue glass pipe contained
               .14 grams of burnt GVM residue (weight does not include pipe).
               The two small plastic bags contained .44 grams of shake GVM
               (weight does not include bags). I told Schuern, Franco,
               Comstock, and Engel I would be forwarding charges to the
               Whitman County Prosecuting Attorney's Office for Minor in
               Possession of Marijuana. They all seemed to understand. I also
               told them I would be notifying WSU Student Conduct. No further
               action. My Vievu camera was activated, and the video has been
               downloaded into the permanent digital evidence folder. I

               2325 hours I was driving eastbound on Cougar Way near Bohler
               Gym when I noticed a group of people walking eastbound near
               Bohler Gym. I noticed one female, later identified as Mckeelie
               Marie Martin 07/14/96, carrying a 40oz beer. I passed the group
               and parked. I exited my car and started walking towards the
               group. As I neared Martin I noticed she appeared to be well
               under the age of 21. Martin saw me and attempted to put the
               beer behind her back. I told Martin that I already saw the beer
               and told her to come talk to me. I had Martin put the beer
               down. Martin placed a 40oz bottle of PBR beer on the ground.
               The beer was about halfway full. I asked Martin if she had her
               ID. Martin said no. I asked Martin how old she was and Martin
               said she was 18 years old. I asked Martin if she went to school
               here and Martin said she was in town visiting. Martin provided
               her name and date of birth verbally. I asked Martin if she had
               been arrested before and Martin said he was arrested for
               alcohol in Federal Way. Martin also stated she was on probation
               for that charge. I asked Martin how long ago her arrest was and
               Martin said it was in January. I asked Martin why she was
               carrying a beer down the street if she was only 18 years old.
               Martin said, "I just had it." I asked Martin where she go the
               beer from and Martin said a friend bought it for her. I looked
               at the beer and it smelled of alcohol. As I spoke to Martin I
               could smell the odor of intoxicants coming from her breath. I
               told Martin that she was under arrest for possession of alcohol
               by a minor and handcuffed (D/L) her. Martin was advised she was
               being audio and video recorded. I read Martin her Miranda
               Rights and she stated she understood. I issued Martin criminal
               citation C8727 for RCW 66.44.270.2A. I explained the citation
               to Martin and provided her with her copy. Martin was released
               from custody and I cleared. I will attempt contact with Federal
               Way Probation to notify them of Martin's arrest. END OF REPORT

               approximately 2330 hours, I was flagged down by a Women's
               Transit Driver in front of the station who stated they had just
               seen about 5-6 males climbing on the cougar statue in front of
               Martin Stadium. He went on to say he thought one of the males
               may have had a can of spray paint and he was afraid they were
               damaging the statue. I responded to the area and did not find
               anyone there. I looked around the area and did not find any
               damage. I cleared. I later contacted a group of males near the
               old Bookie and asked if they had been climbing on the statue.
               They said they had been taking photographs of each other near
               the statue. They stated they did not have any spray paint and
               would never harm Butch like that. I thanked them and cleared. I
               did not identify any of them. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 19th day of

               approximately 0006 hours I was dispatched to a traffic offense
               in the area of Stephenson. Dispatch stated Marco A. Moreno
               10/22/93, had reported seeing several people around a black 4
               door pickup drinking. Moreno told dispatch he then saw the
               truck leave the parking lot towards Rogers Hall. I responded to
               the area but was unable to locate the truck. About this time
               Cpl. Daniels saw a dark green truck with several people in the
               bed of it head towards the Alumni Center. I responded to the
               Alumni Center and found a 1995 Chevrolet Silverado with
               approximately 6 people standing around it. I contacted the
               driver of the truck, Noe Santacruz 06/07/96, and told him what
               had been reported to me. Santacruz said nobody had been
               drinking and told me I could search his truck if I wanted. I
               told Santacruz that just looking into the cab would be
               sufficient. Nowhere in the truck did I notice alcohol. I also
               did not detect the odor of intoxicants on any of the people. I
               thanked everybody for their time and cleared. END OF REPORT I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 19th day of April, 2015, in Pullman,

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1843 SYNOPSIS: A group of about 30-50
               were gathering outside Ensminger Pavilion. Group dispersed as
               soon as I contacted them. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR#
               1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 04-19-15 at approximately 0019 hours, I
               observed a lot of vehicles and subjects near the Ensminger
               Pavilion. I had seen earlier on the calendar an event for
               "Queer-Easy" Queer Prom was supposed to be at the facility. I
               observed all of the subjects around the vehicles were not
               dressed as one would expect for a prom. I got out of my vehicle
               and as I was walking around, a male approached me. He was later
               identified as Dezmon Epps by his CA Driver's License. Epps
               stated it was his sister's birthday and he was hosting a
               surprise party for her at Ensminger. Epps went on to say the
               person who owns the building was coming to open it for them. I
               told Epps the building had been reserved by another group and
               asked who he had contacted for the building. Epps could not
               tell me and the more questions he asked, the more vague he
               became. I told Epps I would wait with him until the person
               arrived. I then observed all of the people who had been in the
               area, began leaving very quickly. I could smell intoxicants in
               the area and had seen people hiding cups when I arrived. After
               about five minutes, Epps said never mind and said they were
               leaving. I checked the building to make sure there was no one
               inside. I also made sure all of the doors were secure before
               clearing. Officers checked the area throughout the night as
               people kept coming by the building to see if the party was
               there. It is my belief someone either had a key they were not
               supposed to have, or they were going to forcibly enter the
               building. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 19th day of April, 2015, in Pullman,

               Arrest/Release/Charges Forwarded MIP Exhibiting 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 04/19/15 at approximately 0022 hours I was at a stop at the
               intersection of B St and Campus St when I noticed a male in a
               red sweatshirt walking southbound on Spokane Street in front of
               Honors Hall. As the walked he was stumbling side to side taking
               up the whole width of the sidewalk. I turned onto Spokane
               Street as the male continued to have difficulty walking. The
               male, later identified as Brian Zackary Keniston 05/24/96,
               started to walk up a sidewalk that leads to Thompson Flats. The
               male stumbled and fell to his left into some ivy bushes. I
               decided to check on the welfare of Keniston after he fell. I
               parked and walked up the sidewalk towards Keniston who was
               still laying in the bushes. When I reached Keniston he was
               laying in the ivy texting on his phone. Keniston appeared to be
               well under the age of 21. I asked Keniston what he was doing
               laying in the bushes and Keniston said he was texting someone.
               While saying this Keniston stood up in very close proximity to
               me. Keniston tried to walk past me but I told him he was not
               free to go. I told Keniston what I had observed and asked him
               where he was coming from. Keniston said he was coming from a
               friends house. I asked Keniston if he had his ID with him and
               Keniston stated he only had his Cougar Card with him. As
               Keniston spoke I could smell the overpowering odor of
               intoxicants coming from his breath. I asked Keniston how old he
               was and Keniston said 18 years old. Keniston provided his date
               of birth verbally. I asked Keniston if I could check his eyes
               and he said I could. I told Keniston to stand with his heels
               and toes together and follow my pen with his eyes only.
               Keniston said he understood. As soon as I moved my pen Keniston
               moved his head to follow. I again reminded Keniston to keep his
               head still. During the HGN test I observed, equal pupil size,
               equal tracking, and lack of smooth pursuit. I was unable to
               fully complete the test because when I attempted the distinct
               and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation, Keniston was not
               follow the pen all the way. Instead Keniston stopped moving his
               eyes at about my shoulder mark. I asked Keniston how much he
               had to drink and Keniston said he had a few drinks. I asked how
               much that was and Keniton said he had two mixed drinks. I told
               Keniston that he was under arrest for MIP Exhibiting and
               handcuffed (D/L) him. I told Keniston that he was being audio

               and video recorded. I read Keniston his Miranda Rights off my
               department issued card. I walked Keniston to my patrol car
               where I told him I would be forwarding charges of MIP
               Exhibiting to the prosecutor. I explained the process to
               Keniston and released him from custody. I asked Keniston if he
               would like a ride home and he said yes. I provided a courtesy
               transport from Honors Hall to Stephenson East for Keniston.
               Once at Stephenson East, Keniston walked into his dorm and I
               cleared. END OF REPORT I certify and declare under penalty of

               Exhibiting NARRATIVE: On 04/19/15 at approximately 0120 hours I
               was driving northbound on Thatuna St. As I neared Linden St I
               noticed a male in a salmon colored button up shirt and khaki
               colored pants standing on the side walk urinating into the
               bushes. As I came to a stop and turned on my emergency lights,
               the male, later identified as Carlos Alonzo Gastelum 05/29/94,
               took off running. Gastelum ran through the crimson parking lot
               and started running down Colorado St westbound. I called out to
               dispatch the description of the male running. There was a
               second male running with Gastelum that was later identified as
               Ramon A. Hernandez Gutierrez 01/11/95. Gastelum and Gutierrez
               ran between Delta Delta Delta Sorority and Coug Housing. I lost
               sight of them about then. Ofc. Whitman was in the area and I
               pointed to where I last saw the two. Ofc. Whitman and I looked
               for the two for a few minutes but were unable to locate them.
               The area had a lot of foot traffic making it more difficult.
               About the time I began to walk away, a female came running down
               the driveway of Delta Delta Delta and said there were two males
               hiding along the side of the house. As the female (not
               identified) was telling me this, she stopped and pointed to to
               males walking northbound on A St away from Delta Delta Delta.
               The female said those were the two. I started walking after the
               two which looked like the two who had ran from me except both
               were no longer wearing button up shirts. Rather both had pants
               and only undershirts on. As I caught up to the two Gutierrez
               turned around and saw me behind them. I yelled "stop police"
               and they kept walking. I said "stop police" one more time and
               they stopped. I told the two they were being detained and
               handcuffed (D/L) both. I asked Gastelum why he ran. Gastelum
               said, yea I know. I asked Gastelum where his shirt went and
               Gastelum informed me he had stuffed it down the front of his
               pants. I asked Gastelum if he had his ID on him and Gastelum
               grabbed his wallet and handed it to me. Gastelum was identified
               as 20 years old. While standing next to Gastelum I could smell
               the strong odor of intoxicants coming from his breath. I also
               observed Gastelum's eyes to be watery and bloodshot. I told
               Gastelum that I was recording and read him his Miranda Rights
               off my department issued card. Gastelum stated he understood

               his rights and did not wish to speak with me. Gastelum then
               said without prompt, "I was just trying to take a piss." I told
               Gastelum he probably should have used a sidewalk then. Pullman
               Ofc. Gordon interviewed Gutierrez. Ofc. Gordon stated he was
               unable to smell intoxicants coming from Gutierrez. Gutierrez
               stated he was in town visiting for the weekend. Since I did not
               have reason to stop Gutierrez initially when both took off
               running Gutierrez was unhandcuffed and told he was free to go.
               I told Gastelum that I was going to be forwarding charges of
               MIP Exhibiting to the prosecutor and issuing him a citation for
               urinating in public. I filled out a sector citation for PCC
               5.50.010 urinating/defacating in public. I issued the citation
               to Gastelum and provided him with his copy. Gastelum was
               released from custody and I cleared. Gastelum is a WSU Student.
               Gutierrez is not. END OF REPORT I certify and declare under

               R. Reynolds 01/12/95 Student Conduct MOMVACA 2. NARRATIVE: On
               04/19/15 at approximately 0232 hours I was driving westbound on
               Orchard Drive when I came to a stop for a red light at the
               intersection of Orchard Drive and Stadium Way. The was a 2002
               Audi A4 in front of me at the red light. As I sat behind the
               Audi, I noticed that the driver's side rear tail light housing
               was broken. This caused the bulbs in the tail light to shine
               white light to the rear of the car instead of red. When the
               signal light turned green the Audi turned left onto Stadium
               Way. I activated my emergency lights and the Audi turned onto
               Flag Lane and came to a stop. I contacted the driver, Kyle
               Richard Reynolds 01/12/95, identified myself, informed Reynolds
               I was recording, and explained the reason for the stop.
               Reynolds stated he had been hit in a parking lot recently which
               broke his tail light. While standing at the driver's side
               window I could smell the odor of intoxicants coming from the
               car. There were two passengers in addition to Reynolds.
               Reynolds provided his driver's license which identified
               Reynolds as 20 years old. I asked Reynolds how much he had to
               drink and Reynolds said none. I asked Reynolds if I could check
               his eyes and he said I could. I performed an HGN test on
               Reynolds as he sat in his car. I observed, equal tracking,
               equal pupil size, and lack of smooth pursuit. I asked Reynolds
               if he was willing to provide a PBT sample and Reynolds said he
               would. I found my PBT (Alco-Sensor FST #16805) in working
               condition. Reynolds provided a PBT sample of .037. I told
               Reynolds that the minor DUI limit was .020 and he had exceeded
               that. Due to Reynolds being close to the minor limit I decided
               I was not going to be arresting him for minor operating a
               moving vehicle after consuming alcohol. I asked Reynolds if
               there was anybody sober in the car and he said no. I told
               Reynolds that I would park his car for him and he and his
               passengers could walk the rest of the way home. Reynolds
               agreed. I parked Reynolds' car on Flag Lane and turned the keys
               back over to him. I told Reynolds that my case would be
               referred to student conduct and Reynolds stated he understood.
               Reynolds and his passengers started walking home and I cleared.
