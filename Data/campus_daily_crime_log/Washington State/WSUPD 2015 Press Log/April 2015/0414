               NARRATIVE: On 04-14-15 at about 1009 hours I was dispatched to
               the report of a cold non-injury collision that had occurred on
               Stadium Way near Martin Stadium about 10 minutes prior to the
               call. Whitcom advised that the RP, Maria S. Previto, was in the
               PPD lobby for contact. I arrived at PPD and contacted Previto.
               She explained that she was driving southbound on Stadium Way
               near Wilson Rd when her light turned green. She said there was
               a car in front of her that stopped to wait for a pedestrian
               before proceeding with their right turn, so she stopped. She
               said she was waiting for the car in front of her to clear their
               turn when a car hit her from behind. She said that speed was
               not very fast and showed me the rear bumper on her car, which
               had no damage. She said the collision scared her and that she
               wanted to report it just in case there was damage to her car
               that you could not see. Previto told me that she was not
               injured and just wanted the incident documented. I took
               pictures of Previto's car and gave her my buisness card with
               the case number on it. She then provided me with the other
               driver's name, license plate, and insurance policy number (but
               not company). I took a picture of this information. After
               ending my contact with Previto I tried to call the other
               driver, Kylee D. Runyan. She did not answer, I left a voicemail
               requesting she call me back. I tried calling Runyan again at
               about 1510 hours. She did not answer, I left her a voicemail
               asking her to return my call. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 14th day of
               April, 2015 in Pullman, Washington.

               was on patrol in vehicle 17, traveling westbound on Terre View
               Dr, approaching the intersection of N. Fairway, when I observed
               a black Jeep traveling eastbound at a speed which appeared to
               be faster than the posted speed limit of 25 MPH. I activated
               the radar unit and it emitted an increasing, high pitch tone,
               with a speed reading of 40 MPH. This speed was consistent with
               my visual estimate and there were no other vehicles in the
               radar field. I turned around to get behind the Jeep. I
               activated my emergency lights, stopping the vehicle in the
               entrance to Palouse Ridge Golf Course. I contacted the driver,
               later identified as Mary E.S. Tucci (11-22-93), and told her
               the reason for the stop. I asked for her driver's license,
               registration and insurance. She was able to provide her
               registration and insurance but said she did not have her
               driver's license with her. She provided her liquor service
               permit with her name and birthday on it. She also advised the
               address on her license would be from Puyallup. I checked
               Tucci's driving status with Whitcom and they advised Tucci was
               DWLS 3rd for unpaid tickets. I returned to her vehicle and
               asked her about her driving status. She told me she did not
               realize her license was suspended. I asked Tucci to exit the
               vehicle, which she did. I told Tucci she was under arrest and
               advised her that she was being audio and video recorded as well
               as her right to an attorney. I placed her in handcuffs, double
               locked, and searched her person. She was then placed in the
               backseat of my patrol car. I completed a sector citation for
               DWLS 3rd degree and a sector infraction for her speed. I
               explained both tickets to Tucci and she was released from
               custody. She called a friend who came from Palouse Ridge to
               drive her car. I checked the calibration of the radar unit
               before and immediately following the stop. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and

               hours I was dispatched to the report of a collision that had
               just occurred at the CUE Parking Garage. The two vehicles
               involved were a 2008 Mitsubishi Galant (WA/AQC6185) driven by
               Elizabeth Nyambura and a 1989 Dodge truck (WA/C23916B) driven
               by Lauren Previs. I contacted both driver's and asked what
               happened. Nyambura stated that she might have been "driving a
               little fast" when she was entering the parking garage. She said
               she was attempting to make the right turn to go up the garage
               when the truck driven by Previs did not stop. She said that she
               thought Previs was going to stop for her to make her turn but
               she didn't and because Previs' truck is so big there was not
               room for her to make her turn at the same time. I asked
               Nyambura how fast she thought she was traveling through the
               parking garage and she said 15MPH. There is a speed limit sign
               inside the garage stating the speed limit as 10MPH. I asked
               Previs what happened. She said she was driving out of the
               parking garage, and was going to make the left turn towards the
               exit, when she realized there had been a collision with
               Nyambura's car. She said that when she saw Nyambura she noticed
               she was traveling "kind of fast" and that she tried to slow
               down more, to allow room for Nyambura to make her turn, but
               there just was not enough room for both vehicles to fit. Previs
               said she was traveling very slow, in first gear. Nyambura said
               that at first the collision was no big deal and she did not
               want to get the police involved until Previs "cursed" and told
               her that she could run over her with her truck. I asked Previs
               what she said to Nyambura about running her over and she said
               she was simply trying to explain to Nyambura that because her
               truck is so big, she could run over her. As Previs explained
               this statement to me, it was not in a threatening manner and
               she told me that she did not threaten Nyambura. I clarified
               with Nyambura about what was said. She told me that she did not
               appreciate being talked to that way and didn't know what was

               Nyambura, she interrupted several times to point out larger
               vehciles that were trying to exit the garage, much like Previs
               would have done. She said "see, they are too big to be in
               here". I explained to Nyambura that although the trucks were
               big, they were allowed to park in the garage and that it is
               everybody's responsibility to slow down and try to give each
               other room. Nyambura showed me the damage that was done to her
               car, which was dents and scratches on the driver's side, rear
               quarter panel. There was no damage to Previs' truck. I took
               pictures of both vehicles. I provided both with my business
               card and the case number. Throughout my contact with both
               driver's Nyambura seemed extremely agitated and somewhat
               confrontational. I had to ask the driver's a couple different
               times to stop talking/shouting at each other. Video of the
               incident was later downloaded to the s: drive. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               14th day of April, 2015 in Pullman, Washington.

               Conduct Poss. of Marijuana NARRATIVE: On 04/15/15 at
               approximately 0043 hours I was dispatched to a drugs call at
               Goldsworthy Hall room 310. The reporting party, Britteny L.
               Alspach, stated there was a strong odor of marijuana coming
               from room 310. Upon arrival I walked to room 310 and could
               smell the strong odor of burnt marijuana coming from within the
               room. I knocked on the door and James Demetrios Mitalas
               11/27/95 answered the door. There were two other occupants in
               the room, Garrett A.L. Lawler 01/25/96 and Collin C.E. Bates
               04/06/96. Mitalas and Lawler live in room 310 and Bates lives
               the next room over in 308. I explained why I was called to the
               room and explained as long as they were willing to turn over
               all their marijuana and smoking devices they would only be sent
               to student conduct. The three agreed to my terms. All three had
               clearly recently smoked since their eyes were extremely
               bloodshot. Lawler grabbed a sandwich bag containing
               approximately two grams of fresh marijuana. Mitalas, Lawler,
               Bates, and I walked down to the dumpster where Lawler destroyed
               the marijuana. I explained how the student conduct process
               works and told them they were free to go. END OF REPORT I
