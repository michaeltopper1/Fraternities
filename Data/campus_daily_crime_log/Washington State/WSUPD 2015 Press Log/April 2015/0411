               getting down from the roof of Kimbrough Hall, located at 680 NE
               Library Rd. Cpl. Kuhrt and I responded to the area. Cougar
               Security told us the male and female that had been on the roof
               were now heading towards Valhalla. I could see two Cougar
               Security units walking behind a male and female, and they
               pointed them out as being the two who had been on the roof. I
               contacted the male and female on Thatuna near Linden St. Ofc.
               Westerman arrived as backup officer. Ofc. Whitman was out with

               of Kimbrough, and they both denied it. Cpl. Kuhrt asked them to
               show us their hands. They both held out their hands and they
               were dirty. Cpl. Kuhrt told them it looked like they had been
               climbing on something. Ryan and Cross both eventually confessed
               to being on the roof. I asked them what they had been doing,
               and they said just enjoying the view. I asked them if they knew
               they should not be up there, and they said yeah. I told Ryan
               and Cross if they were caught on the roof again they would be
               arrested for trespassing. They both said they understood. Cpl.
               Kuhrt, Ofc. Westerman, and I cleared the scene. No further
               investigation. My Vievu camera was activated, and the video has

               for the above described violation in the parking lot of Olympia

               told Jones I pulled her over because her center brake light was
               out on her vehicle. I went back to my patrol vehicle, and I ran
               Jones for a records check. My return showed Jones' WA driver's
               license was suspended in the third degree for two unpaid
               traffic ticket. I went back and contacted Jones, and I
               explained to her I would be issuing her a criminal citation for
               driving while license suspended. I issued Jones Sector criminal
               citation #5Z0228106 for driving while license suspended in the
               third degree. I provided Jones with her copy of the citation
               and explained the instructions on the citation. Jones passenger
               had a valid driver's license, so she was able to park the
               vehicle for Jones. Cpl. Kuhrt and I cleared the scene. No

               Ryckman told me she is receiving text messages from somebody
               she does not know, but the individual texting her knows her
               name. Ryckman told me she received the first message from phone
               number (509)636-8247 on 03-25-15 at about 1200 hours. Ryckman
               said the text message said "I have something of yours". Ryckman
               told me she asked who it was, and the individual responded they
               are a friend of a friend. Ryckman said she received another
               text from the person, saying he had some pictures of her and
               what she wanted him to do about it. Ryckman said she told the
               texter he does not have any. Ryckman said the texter responded
               he does and he got them from a friend. Ryckman told me she
               asked the texter his name, and he said Mike. Ryckman told me
               she asked the texter if he knew her name, and he said her first
               name. Ryckman told me she stopped responding to him after that.
               Ryckman said she received that text on 04-12-15 at about 0115
               hours. I asked Ryckman what dates she received texts from this
               person, and she told me March 26th and 30th. Ryckman told me
               she also received them on April 10th and 12th. I asked Ryckman
               if she told the person to stop contacting her, and she told me
               no. Ryckman told me she just wants the text messages to stop.
               Ryckman told me she feels threatened. I asked Ryckman if there
               were any pictures out there she should be concerned about, and
               she said that is a low possibility, but there may be. I asked
               her if she knows anyone who may have those photos that would
               have shared them, and she told me no. I told Ryckman to text
               the person back and let them know she contacted the police and
               she wants to be left alone. I asked Ryckman to email me the
               text message conversation, and she said she would. I told
               Ryckman to contact me if she continued to receive texts
               messages from this person. The investigation continues. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 13th day of April, 2015, in Pullman,

    Narrative: RVWD:MTK/336 OFC: DBT/321 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1711 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched to a
               fire alarm at McCroskey Hall. There was a kitchen fire in the
               basement. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 04-12-15 at approximately 0343 hours Sgt. Griffin, Cpl.
               Kuhrt, Ofc. Westerman, Ofc. Whitman, and I responded to
               McCroskey Hall, located 1055 NE Campus St. for a fire alarm.
               Dispatch advised there was the report of smoke coming from the
               basement of McCroskey Hall. We arrived on scene and one of the
               students outside told me the smoke was coming from the
               basement. Pullman Fire arrived on scene and entered the
               building and located where the smoke was coming from. They
               entered the basement floor where the fire sprinklers had been
               activated. The area was by kitchenette in #20A. The
               firefighters told us the fire appeared to have been started
               from burnt food on the stovetop. Once the smoke was clear I was
               shown the kitchenette. There was a pot sitting on the stove
               top, and whatever had been inside was all burnt. The hood vent
               on the oven appeared to be damaged along with the wall. I
               estimated the damage from the fire to be approximately
               $2000.00. I took photographs of the damage from the fire and
               they have been uploaded into Spillman. Cpl. Kuhrt and I
               contacted the Hall Director of McCroskey, Timothy E. Martin
               (DOB 01-24-87), who told us he would try to figure out which
               student was responsible for the fire. Martin said they would
               take care of it with Student Housing. We cleared the scene. No
               further action. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 13th day of April, 2015, in

               a large laceration to their forehead on the 4th floor of Perham

               an injured person at Perham Hall room 414. Dispatch stated that
               a male had split his head open and alcohol was involved. Ofc.
               Whitman and I responded to the 4th floor of Perham where I
               found Austin Thomas Anderson 04/11/93 in the hallway. Anderson
               had a large laceration to his forehead. The laceration was deep
               enough that you could see his skull. Anderson was clearly
               intoxicated but was able to answer all my questions. Anderson
               said he stumbled and fell into the door frame for his room. I
               asked Anderson if he had his ID with him and Anderson provided
               me his military ID. Ofc. Whitman ran Anderson through dispatch
               and dispatch advised Anderson had a misdemeanor warrant for his
               arrest. After medics evaluated Anderson, Anderson decided to go
               to the hospital for stitches for his head. I responded to
               Pullman Regional Hospital and waited for Anderson to be
               discharged. Once Anderson was discharged I told him he was
               under arrest for his warrant. Anderson was advised he was being
               audio and video recorded. I transported Anderson from PRH to
               Whitman County Jail. Once at the Jail I read Anderson a copy of
               the warrant and turned him over to jail staff. END OF REPORT I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
