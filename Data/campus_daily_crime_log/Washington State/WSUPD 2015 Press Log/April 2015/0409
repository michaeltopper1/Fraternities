               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1652 04/09/15 SYNOPSIS: Recovered a
               vehicle that had been reported stolen from New Orleans,
               Louisiana. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On April 9, 2015 at about 1304 hours I was
               dispatched to the report of a recovered stolen vehicle located
               in the Green 2 Parking lot off of Oak Street. WSU Parking
               Services issued a parking ticket on the vehicle. The vehicle
               had no permanent license plates and was displaying a temporary
               Washington plate in the rear window. WSU Parking Services
               discovered the vehicle was reported stolen when they ran the
               VIN. I responded to the parking lot and located the vehicle. I
               confirmed the VIN displayed on the gray Lexus four door was
               JTHBE262575012719. I ran the VIN through NCIC which confirmed
               the vehicle was stolen. New Orleans Police Department entered
               the vehicle as stolen on January 10, 2015. A male approached
               the vehicle while I was on scene. He was identified as Ahmed M.
               Alhinai (11/16/93). Alhiani is a citizen of Oman. He is a
               current WSU student. Alhinai told me he purchased the vehicle
               from First Union Auto in Seattle, WA on March 31, 2015. Alhinai
               produced the sales paperwork from the glove box of the vehicle.
               The vehicle purchase order shows the vehicle was sold for
               $13,400.00 with an odometer reading of 148327 miles on March
               31, 2015. I called First Union Auto and spoke with "Majid". I
               was told First Union Auto purchased the vehicle on March 9,
               2015 from an auction in Georgia. Majid said according to the
               Carfax documents the vehicle had been listed as stolen in Texas
               on June 19, 2014. On that same day Texas Motor Vehicle
               Department issued or updated the title and/or loan or lien
               reported. First Union Auto had the vehicle transported from
               Georgia to Seattle, WA where it was sold to Alhiani. I received
               a copy of the Carfax documents and a copy of the Washington
               Vehicle Title/Registration Certificate issued April 8, 2015.
               Majid said he had just received the Washington plates and
               registration. The assigned Washington license plates on this
               vehicle are AUH5017. Majid said he will mail the plates and
               registration to Alhiani. I explained to Alhiani that the
               vehicle was reported and confirmed stolen. I was not able to
               let him take the vehicle. He voluntarily surrendered the only
               key to the vehicle. He let me take his sales paperwork so I
               could sort out the information. Alhiani was told if he took the
               vehicle that he would be charged with motor vehicle theft. He
               said he understood. Alhiani was very cooperative throughout my
               contact with him. He left the scene as he had to go to class. I

               had Whitcom run the VIN through Texas. I received a return
               showing a lien on March 22, 2014 from Toyota Motor Credit Corp
               of Atlanta, GA. The remarks state "Stolen, verify TCIC by VIN.
               Actual Mileage. Date of assignment: 2014/03/22. Paper Title. E-
               Title Print Date: 01/21/2015." Whitcom confirmed with New
               Orleans Police that the vehicle was stolen. Whitcom sent NOPD a
               vehicle locate/recovery. I requested and received a copy of the
               NOPD police report #A-11159-15. According to the report,
               Tiffany Winn, spoke with a NOPD officer on the telephone
               regarding her vehicle that was missing from her driveway. The
               officer advised Winn to go to the Seventh District station to
               complete an Auto Theft Affidavit form. I called Winn and spoke
               with her at about 1533 hours on this date. Winn told me the
               vehicle actually belongs to her father Gary Francis of Austin,
               TX. She went on to tell me that she reported the vehicle stolen
               from her driveway in New Orleans, LA. I asked her if she had
               filled out the Auto Theft Affidavit form. She said "No, nobody
               came to the house." I asked if she went to the Seventh District
               station. She said "no". Winn said she really was not sure if
               the vehicle had been stolen or repossessed. She said she was
               sixty days late on payments. I asked her if she contacted
               Toyota Financial after the vehicle was gone. She said "no." I
               asked Winn if she collected any insurance money. She told me
               that insurance would not pay her for seven months. To date she
               claims to have not collected any insurance money. I called the
               NOPD NCIC division and spoke with Sgt. Joseph. I explained the
               circumstances of the case to him. He said he will have
               detectives from the Seventh District go out to Winn's residence
               and contact her. Sgt. Joseph confirmed that she did not fill
               out an Auto Theft Affidavit form. I will be contacted by NOPD
               detectives tomorrow. I later called Alhaini and explained what
               I learned about the vehicle. I told him that I must keep
               possession of the vehicle until NOPD resolves the issue of the
               vehicle being stolen or repossessed. I told him that I will
               have a wheel lock placed on the vehicle overnight. I will not
               tow and impound the vehicle. At my request WSU Parking Services
               applied a wheel lock to the front driver's side wheel. I
               photographed the vehicle after the wheel lock was applied. The
               investigation continues. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 9th day of April,

               stolen Cougar Card at Flix. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 04-09-15 at approximately 1703
               hours, I was advised of a report of a cold fraud. The manager
               of Flix had called to report an employee, who has since been
               terminated, possibly used a stolen Cougar Card for purchases at
               Flix. I later contacted the rp, Michael Clarke, who stated on
               03-30-15 he was advised by his superiors a stolen Cougar Card
               had been used to make purchases at Flix. Clarke looked at the
               transactions with the card and found there were several
               transactions made on 03-29-15 with the card. He then looked at
               the transactions to see who the cashier's had been. He stated
               when they are made aware of incidents like this, they talk with
               the cashiers as it is a policy violation for them to not check
               the pictures and match the ID with the person making the
               transaction. Clarke stated he found after looking at the
               transactions and speaking with the cashiers working that
               Jennifer Castro had been involved with the majority of the
               transactions. He stated it was odd there were multiple
               transactions, including one which was for a large amount of
               rice krispy treats. He stated he spoke to the Student Manager
               about this particular purchase and the student stated Castro
               had asked if she could purchase a whole box of the treats and
               was told yes. Clarke stated none of the cashiers working
               admitted to checking her out and he believes Castro probably
               did the transaction herself. Clarke stated based on these
               violations with Castro and previous issues they have had with
               her, they terminated her yesterday. I asked him if he had
               spoken to her about the transactions and he stated he had. He
               stated she had apologized for not checking the ID closer, but
               did not make any other comments. Clarke advised me their policy
               is once they are made aware of a stolen card being used for
               transactions, they refund the amount to the card owner. I asked
               Clarke if he had copies of all the transactions and he stated
               he did. I asked him to email them to me and he stated he would.
               Investigation continues. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 9th day of April,

               approximately 1854 hours, Ofc. Jones and I responded to Wilmer
               Davis Hall for the report of a suicidal subject. I was advised
               by Whitcom the RP had been speaking with a female who had
               stated she was going to kill herself and then hung up the
               phone. When the RP called back, the female did not answer the
               phone. They stated she has a history of depression. I responded
               directly to the females room and contacted her as she was
               leaving the room. I asked her if she was MaKenzie and she
               stated yes. I asked if I could speak with her and she said yes.
               I told I was called there because she had made a comment to
               someone on the phone about hurting herself. She stated she had
               not made any statements of hurting herself. I asked her what
               the conversation was about and she stated it was private and
               she didn't want to talk about it. I asked her if she had a
               history of depression and she said yes. She also stated she
               takes medication for it and had taken her medication today. I
               asked her if she sees a counselor and she stated not at WSU.
               She told me she had dealt with several counselors, but doesn't
               like them and doesn't believe they help her. At some point
               while speaking with her, I activated my camera and I advised
               her I was recording with video and audio. MaKenzie asked if we
               could talk in her room and I said sure. I asked her about her
               classes and she stated she was doing okay, but later admitted
               she was having problems in one of her history classes, but
               stated it was not the problem. While talking with her I asked
               Ofc. Jones to contact the RP and take his statement. MaKenzie
               and I spoke about various things and I asked her if she had
               ever tried to hurt herself before and she said, "no never". I
               asked her if she had ever thought about it and she said no. I
               asked her where she had been headed when I arrived and she
               stated she had called her Big Sis and was headed to the
               sorority to hangout with her. I asked her if she had plans for
               tomorrow and she stated her mother was coming for the weekend.
               MaKenzie seemed upset, but wasn't crying. She stated the RP,
               was overly sensitive. Ofc. Jones at this point contacted me and
               advised me the RP, Connor, had been in a relationship with
               MaKenzie for about a year. He had stated they had been talking
               for about an hour and he had been breaking up with her. He

               stated at one point she stated, "I am going to kill myself" and
               then hung up the phone. When he tried to call her back she
               didn't answer. Based on her history of depression and he being
               upset about them breaking up he was concerned she would
               actually hurt herself. I re-contacted MaKenzie and advised her
               of what I had been told had happened. She stated she had not
               said she was going to kill herself. I advised her based on the
               information I had, I felt she needed to go to the hospital. She
               stated she didn't really want to and we discussed her options.
               MaKenzie stated she would be willing to go voluntarily to PRH.
               I transported her to PRH and advised the staff of what I knew.
               I told MaKenzie to call if she needed a ride home and she
               stated she would. I cleared. My video was later downloaded on

               FINISHED*** On 04-10-15 at approximately 0215 hours Cpl. Kuhrt
               and I were traveling north bound on NE Stadium Way near
               Mooberry Track, when I observed a Dark Blue 2004 Toyota Tundra
               (WA Lic. B12018Z) traveling southbound on Stadium Way that
               appeared to be speeding. I activated my radar (Veh 16) and it
               displayed the vehicle was traveling 28 MPH. The speed limit on
               Stadium Way is 20 MPH. I activated my emergency lights and
               pulled over the vehicle for speeding. I contacted the driver of
               the vehicle who identified herself as Amanda B. Skalabrin (DOB
               01-07-95). As I approached the vehicle Skalabrin already had
               her driver's license in her hand and was giving it to me. I
               told Skalabrin I was recording and I pulled her over for going
               28 MPH on Stadium Way. I could smell the strong odor of
               marijuana coming from the vehicle, and I could also see small
               flakes of what appeared to be marijuana on her sweat pants. I
               asked Skalabrin if she had been smoking tonight, and she told
               me no. She told me she was at her friend's house, who smokes a
               lot. I asked Skalabrin if she would be willing to take some
               voluntary field sobriety tests, and she said yes. When
               Skalabrin exited the vehicle I could still smell the strong
               odor of marijuana coming off of her. I administered the HGN
               test and did not ask Skalabrin to do any further tests I asked
               Skalabrin if I may search her vehicle, and she said no. Cpl.
               Kuhrt asked her how much marijuana was in the vehicle, and she
               never answered. Skalbrin then became sick and threw up in a
               nearby trash can. I told Skalabrin I would be applying for a
               search warrant. Cpl. Kuhrt told her we would be seizing her
               vehicle. Sgt. Griffin is waiting with the vehicle at 1845 E.
               Grimes Way near Bustad Hall. ****REPORT NOT FINISHED**** I
