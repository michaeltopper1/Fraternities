               lobby saying he was currently on the phone with someone
               claiming to be from the IRS saying he owed them money. When I
               arrived at the front lobby Cooredor no longer had them on the
               phone. Corredor explain the person claiming to be from the IRS
               said he had made a misstake filing his taxes and owe the
               Government $20,000. Cooredor said he filed his own taxes and
               didn't believe he made an erronous mistake. Then the
               coversation changed to if he could pay $4,500 right away then
               things could be made good. Corredor said he was threatened with
               larger fines and jail time. Cooredor was visably shooken up.
               While we were talking Corredor received another call this
               individual(IRS). I got on the phone and started talking with
               the individual. I identified myself and asked to his
               supervisor, and he told me he was the supervisor. I asked if he
               would call the station so I could verify who he was saying he
               was. The individual tried to convince me to call him at his
               number. When I told him he needed to call me his response was
               "Sgt. Macy, you can suck my dick", and then he hung up. I

               On 4/10/15 an employee of the CUB brought the following to be
               processed at the WSU PD lost and found. Black Panasonic Lumix
               camera. No identifying marks to indicate owner. From the
               pictures it would appear to belong to a visiting mother of a
               graduating blond female student. Since this does not narrow
               down the owner/canidate list too much I am placing the camera
               in storage in the hopes the owner will contact the WSU PD and
               claim it. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under

               parked in the HD space behind McEachern Hall and another parked
               illegally. Three vehicles were issued parking infractions.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 04-10-
               15 at approximately 2217 hours, I was dispatched to a parking
               complaint behind McEachern Hall. The RP stated a vehicle was
               parked illegally and another was in the HD space with no
               permit. When I arrived I found there were three vehicles parked
               in the area. The first vehicle was parked in the Green Parking
               space, however it was parked in the middle of two parking
               spaces impeding others from parking correctly. The yellow lines
               were faded, but I could still see the line at the rear of the
               vehicle. The vehicle was centered over the yellow line. I
               issued the vehicle, WA/AQP9883, parking infraction #148225 for
               WAC 504-15-040/220 for Improper Parking. The second vehicle was
               parked in the HD space with no permit. I issued vehicle
               WA/978ZPS parking infraction #148224 for WAC 504-15-210 for
               Reserved Area. The third vehicle was parked along the wall
               which has been painted yellow like a yellow curb and is not a
               parking space. I issued vehicle WA/140ZID parking infraction
               #148223 for WAC 504-15-220 for No Parking Zone. I cleared and
               later placed the infractions in the parking folder. I was later
               called back to the scene reference case #15-W1685 for the owner
               of vehicle WA/AQP9883. The owner wanted to speak to me about
               the ticket. See other case. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 10th day of April,

               The ticket was explained to her. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 04-10-15 at approximately 2217
               hours, I responded to the area behind McEachern Hall to contact
               the owner of a vehicle I issued a parking infraction to earlier
               in the evening. See case #15-W1684. When I exited my vehicle, I
               activated my body camera and the video was later downloaded to
               the S: drive. The RP was upset with the ticket as she felt she
               had parked legally. I explained the ticket was issued to her
               because she parked in the middle of two parking spaces blocking
               both of them. She stated when she arrived, it was dark and she
               was unable to see the lines. I showed her where the yellow line
               was protruding from the back of her vehicle and she stated she
               didn't park any further over because she thought the lines were
               "X" out the parking space. I advised her again the ticket was
               issued for the improper parking. I explained to her the process
               to contest a ticket and suggested she speak to parking on
               Monday when the office was open. I did not identify the female.
               I cleared. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true

               (061861) Forward DUI 2. NARRATIVE: On 041015 at approximately
               2330 hours I was driving southbound on Stadium Way near NE
               North Fairway Rd when I observed a northbound vehicle (WA/
               AHZ4024) moving in excess of the posted 20 mph. I activated my
               radar (vehicle 17) and the radar confirmed the vehicle was
               moving at 30 mph. The radar's calibration was verified before
               and after the stop. I turned around, activated my emergency
               lights, and stopped the vehicle at St James Episcopal Church. I
               contacted the driver, Kelli A. Kohout (061861), informed her we
               were being recorded, and asked if she knew why I was stopping
               her. She did not. I informed her that she had been driving 30
               mph in a 20 mph zone. I requested Kohout's WADL, insurance, and
               registration. I could smell the odor of intoxicants coming from
               the vehicle. Kohout provided the appropriate documents. I asked
               if she had anything drink and she said no. I then said "zero"
               and she said she had a glass of wine. I asked if she would be
               willing to provide a breath sample for me and she said no. I
               had her step out of the vehicle and speak with me. She
               complied. Ofc. Whitman had arrived as backup and turned my
               overhead lights off. I told Kohout that I wanted to make sure
               she was not driving impaired and asked if she would do
               voluntary field sobriety tests and she said "sure". She denied
               having diabetes, epilepsy, or physical impairments. Kohout
               wears contacts and had them in. She is not blind in either eye.
               HGN Test I informed her that she would be following my pen with
               her eyes and her eyes only. I instructed her, keep her arms at
               her sides, keep her feet together, and to follow my pen with
               her eyes. I verified that her pupils were equal and that her
               eyes were able to track my pen equally. During the test she
               lost track of my pen and I had to direct her to where the pen
               was. I tested for HGN and found a lack of smooth pursuit in
               both eyes. Kohout did display a distinct and sustained
               nystagmus at maximum deviation. I did not see an onset of
               nystagmus prior to 45 degrees in both eyes. I tested for
               vertical nystagmus and did not observe anything of note. While
               she performed the test she swayed to the rear and her right. I
               could smell the odor of intoxicants on her breath. Her eyes
               were watery. Walk and Turn Test I instructed Kohout to place
               her heels together, her toes together, keeping her arms at her
               sides. I explained to her that she was to imagine a straight
               line coming out of her left foot and to place her right foot on

               that line, heel to toe. She was then told not to begin the rest
               of the test until instructed to do so, but to stay in the
               position she was in. I then told her she would take nine heel
               to toe steps down the line, then leave the front foot on the
               straight line, and take a series of small steps around that
               foot. She would then take 9 more steps back down the straight
               line. She was instructed to keep her arms down at her sides,
               watch her feet, and count her steps out loud. I demonstrated
               the test, taking 3 steps out, turning, and taking 3 steps back.
               I repeatedly explained that she would be taking 9 steps while I
               was showing her 3 steps. She was wearing cowboy boots and I
               told her she could remove them. She did so. She got back into
               the start position with difficulty and would not stay in the
               start position. She felt she was on a slant in the parking lot
               so we moved to a flatter area very close to a street light. I
               instructed Kohout to place her heels together, her toes
               together, keeping her arms at her sides. I explained to her
               that she was to imagine a straight line coming out of her left
               foot and to place her right foot on that line, heel to toe. She
               was then told not to begin the rest of the test until
               instructed to do so, but to stay in the position she was in. I
               then told her she would take nine heel to toe steps down the
               line, then leave the front foot on the straight line, and take
               a series of small steps around that foot. She would then take 9
               more steps back down the straight line. She was instructed to
               keep her arms down at her sides, watch her feet, and count her
               steps out loud. I demonstrated the test, taking 3 steps out,
               turning, and taking 3 steps back. I explained that she would be
               taking 9 steps while I was showing her 3 steps. She again would
               not stay in the start position, I repeatedly have to tell her
               to stay in the position. I asked her if she had any questions
               and she asked if she was to go "9 forward and 9 back" and I
               said that was correct. She missed heel to toe contact on nearly
               every step. She completed approximately 9 steps. Did not make a
               turn, and walked backwards not making heel to toe contact. Her
               arms were not touching her sides. One Leg Stand I instructed
               Kohout to place her heels together and her toes together and
               her arms at her sides. I told her to stay in the position until
               I told her to begin the test. I explained to her that she could
               choose either leg to raise 6 inches off the ground. I told her
               that she needed to point her raised foot and to keep her eyes
               on that foot while he counted out loud 1001, 1002, 1003 and so
               on, until told to stop. She was instructed to keep her foot
               parallel to the ground. She was told to keep her arms down at
               her sides. I asked her if she understood and she said she did.
               I demonstrated the test for her. She stood on her left leg and
               tried to start before being instructed to do so. Once I told
               her to start she did not count out loud. She stumbled and used
               her arms for balance. She put her foot down multiple times.
               Once reminded to count out loud she started the test again and
               counted "1, 2, 3" and put her foot back down. I then asked
               Kohout if she would provide a breath sample for a PBT,
               informing her it was voluntary and did not replace the
               evidentiary breath test, and she said "I don't know yet" so I
               asked her when she would know. She asked what the repercussions

               would be for not providing a breath sample. I told her I could
               not say too much because that could be considered coercive. I
               told her my decision would be based on other factors and she
               refused to give a sample. I then placed her under arrest
               (handcuffed) for DUI. I informed her she was being audio and
               visually recorded and that she had the right to an attorney. I
               then read her her Miranda rights. She said she understood them.
               I asked her if she had any questions for me and she said she
               did not. I explained to her what was going to happen regarding
               processing and her vehicle being towed. We then assisted her in
               getting her boots back on. She was displeased with being in
               handcuffs and admitted to having a "few cocktails". I
               reiterated that her vehicle was going to be towed and she said
               "No fucking way". She started talking about medicines she
               needed that were in the car and pulled away from me. I asked
               her what she would need in the next 2 hours as that's how long
               I expected us to take for processing. She then asked about her
               car again. She was asking about where she and her friend were
               going to stay that evening. I asked again about medication and
               got no response. She then commented on how we had better things
               to do. She was placed in the back of my patrol car and
               transported to Pullman PD for processing. Ofc. Whitman stayed
               on scene for the tow and later transported Kohout's passenger
               to the Manor Lodge. Once at the station, Kohout asked me again
               about her vehicle. She was concerned about her belongings and I
               offered have her friend get things out of her vehicle. I got no
               response. When we got into processing she became angry that she
               did not have any of her belongings. I told her I planned on
               taking her where she needed to go. I told her I had offered to
               get things out of the car. I then read her her Constitutional
               Rights from the DUI packet. When I reached #2 she said she
               wanted an attorney. We stood up and I took her into the
               interview room and had her sit down. I began dialing the Public
               Defender. She stated she wanted her own attorney and I handed
               her the phone. She stated she wanted an attorney of her own
               choosing when she got back to Seattle. I asked if she wanted an
               attorney right then and she confirmed she did not want an
               attorney at that time. We sat back down and continued with the
               packet. At 0001 hours I read Burnette his constitutional rights
               and he signed the form. At 0001 hours I checked Kohout's mouth
               and found no foreign substances. During the 15 minute
               observation period, I observed Kohout's the entire time and she
               did not vomit, eat, smoke, drink, or place anything in her
               mouth. At 0002 hours I read her the implied consent warning for
               breath. She said she thought she had already "denied" that, I
               told her that had been the PBT. I explained this was a
               different test but that she could decline to provide a sample.
               I asked him if was willing to provide 2 breath samples and she
               said she would not. She did not have any questions other than
               about me releasing her. Kohout did complete the DUI interview.
               I checked that the breath tube was warm to the touch, the
               machine was on, the antenna was attached, and the sim,
               temperature was within 34c +/- .3c. At 0021 hours Kohout
               refused to provide a sample. When the test document was printed
               I signed and explained the results to Kohout. A copy was

               included in her property along with her tow form. I provided
               Kohout with her Driver's hearing request and she signed the DUI
               packet. I then escorted Kohout out of PPD and told her she was
               free to go but that I would be forwarding charges to the
               prosecutor and she would be contacted at the address on her
               license. She accepted a courtesy transport to Manor Lodge. I
               cleared. She was not issued an infraction for her speed.
               Nothing follows. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 11th day of April, 2015, in

               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1688 SYNOPSIS: Arrested female
               driver for DUI. Cited and released. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE

               5Z0321629 2. NARRATIVE: On 04/11/15 at about 0035 hours I was
               driving eastbound on Cougar Way. I saw a vehicle driving behind
               my vehicle with no headlights on. I pulled over to the side of
               the road and allowed the vehicle to pass me. I then pulled out
               behind the vehicle and activated my emergency lights and
               conducted a traffic stop. I contacted the driver, Ehli, Chimene
               J. (062670). I told her the stop was being recorded and asked
               her for her license, registration and proof of insurance. I
               asked Ehli if she knew why I stopped her. She said she did not.
               I then asked if she was having trouble seeing, she said she was
               not. I told her the reason I stopped her was because her
               headlights were off. I could also smell an odor of intoxicants
               coming from the vehicle. I asked Ehli how many drinks she had.
               She said she had one drink four hours ago. She found all of the
               items I asked her for, I returned her proof of insurance. I
               stepped back from the vehicle and handed her license and
               vehicle registration to Sgt. Griffin. I then returned to the
               vehicle and asked Ehli if she would do some voluntary field
               sobriety test. She said she would and exited the vehicle. I
               began the standardized field sobriety tests by asking her to
               stand with her feet together, hands at her side, and to stay in
               that position during the first test. The first test is the
               Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. I explained to Ehli that it was
               an eye test. She was wearing glasses and I asked her to remove
               them for the test. She placed them on top of her head. I
               explained that during the test she needed to follow the tip of
               my pen with her eyes only, and not to move her head. Ehli said
               she understood. I observed both of Ehli's pupils were equal
               size and there was no resting nystagmus. Her eyes tracked
               equally. I observe a lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes. I
               observed distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation
               in both eyes. I did not observe onset of nystagmus prior to 45
               degrees in either eye. While I was conducting the HGN I also
               observed Ehli swaying approximately three to four inches. Her
               eyes were bloodshot and watery. Ehli was wearing boots with
               about a one to two inch heel on them. I asked her if she wanted
               to take them off. Ehli decided to keep them on. I asked if she
               had any physical ailments that would keep her from doing the
               tests. She said there were not. The next test I explained to
               Ehli was the walk and turn. I explained to Ehli to imagine a

               line straight out in front of her and to place her left foot on
               that line an then place he right foot in front of her left with
               her heel and toe touching. I told her to keep her hands at her
               sides and to maintain that position while I explained the test
               and not to begin the test until I told her to. I explained to
               Ehli that she was to take nine heel to toe steps along the
               imaginary line. Then when she reached her ninth step to keep
               that foot on the line and make a series of small steps to turn
               around and take nine to heel to steps back along the same line.
               I demonstrated three steps and I also demonstrated the turn and
               then three return steps, explaining that she needed to take the
               full nine steps down and back. I told her that during the test
               she needed to keep her hands at her side, look at her feet
               while she was walking and count her steps out loud. I also told
               her that once she began the test she needed to continue until
               the test was complete. I asked Ehli if she had any questions,
               she asked if she was supposed to walk backwards for the return
               nine steps. I explained she was to complete the turn and then
               return nine steps. I told her to begin the test. Ehli could not
               maintain the starting position while I explained the test. She
               moved her feet offline and stood with them side by side while I
               completed the instructions. Ehli began the test. During the
               test she stepped offline on step three, she missed heel to toe
               on step five, she stepped on her toe on step six, and she
               missed heel to toe on step nine. At the turn she paused and
               asked how to do the turn. I told her to take a series of small
               steps. She did not pivot on her ninth step, she lifted both
               feet and turned around. On the return walk she missed heel to
               toe on step four, she stepped offline on step five, she missed
               heel to toe on step eight and nine. The next test I explained
               was the one leg stand. I instructed Ehli to stand with her feet
               together, hands at her side, and to maintain that position
               while I explained the instructions. I also told her not to
               begin the test until I told her to. I asked if she understood
               she said she did. I explained that during this test she was to
               lift the foot of her choice so that her foot was six inches off
               the ground and parallel to the ground, with both legs straight.
               Then she was to count out loud by one thousands, and I
               demonstrated the stance and the counting "one thousand one, one
               thousand two, one thousand three". I explained that during the
               test she needed to keep her hands at her side, she needed to
               look at her foot and to count out loud as demonstrated. I asked
               if she had any questions, she said she did not. I asked her
               which foot she was going to raise, she said she was going to
               raise her right foot. Ehli lifted her right foot up and began
               to count. Ehli lifted her arms away from her body about six to
               eight inches to maintain her balance. When she was at seven I
               reminded her to keep her foot parallel to the ground and look
               at her foot, she stopped counting after that. Ehli put her foot
               down twice during the thirty second test. She was swaying
               during the test. I then told her the next test was the
               preliminary breath test (PBT). I told her that it did not
               replace the evidentiary breath test and like the other tests it
               is voluntary. Ehli said she did not want to provide a sample
               for the PBT. I told Ehli she was under arrest for DUI. I

               handcuffed(DL) Ehli and told her again she was being recorded.
               I read her Miranda warnings from my department issued card. I
               asked her if there was anything she wanted out of her vehicle,
               she said she wanted her cell phone. Sgt. Griffin retrieved her
               cell from her son who was in the vehicle. I searched Ehli and
               placed her in the back of my vehicle. Sgt. Griffin remained on
               scene to wait for the tow and I transported Ehli to Pullman
               Police Department for the BAC. I arrived at Pullman PD and
               began the BAC with Ehli. I read Ehli her constitutional rights.
               Ehli understood her rights and requested to speak to an
               attorney. I took her to the phone room in the Pullman PD
               holding area and called public defender Steve Martonick, and
               handed the phone to Ehli. I left the room and closed the door
               while Ehli spoke to Martonick. Once Ehli was done speaking with
               Martonick I brought her back out to the BAC. I asked her with
               her rights in mind and after talking to attorney if she would
               answer questions. She said she would. I read Ehli the implied
               consent warnings and she signed that she had them read to her
               at 0123 hours. I asked Ehli if she would submit to a breath
               test. She said she would. I checked Ehli's mouth at 0125 hours
               and found no foreign substances. Ehli provided a breath sample
               of .084 at 0154 hours, and a sample of .082 at 0156 hours. The
               breath sample was administered in accordance to the methods
               approved by the Washington State Toxicologist pursuant to the
               Washington Administrative Code. I provided Ehli with the
               Driver's Hearing Request form, the Notice of Hearing/Conditions
               of Release form, a copy of the Breath Test Document, and the
               Tow/Impound form. I issued Ehli a criminal citation for DUI
               (#5Z0321629). I gave her a copy and released Ehli from custody.
               I provided Ehli a courtesy transport back to her son's dorm,
               Stephenson East, where she was staying the evening. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.
               Dated this 12th day of April, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.
