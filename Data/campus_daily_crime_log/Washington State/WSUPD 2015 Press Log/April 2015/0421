               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1885 SYNOPSIS: Report of a cold domestic
               dispute. Determined to be verbal only. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 04-21-15 at about 0948 hours I
               was dispatched to the report of a cold domestic dispute at
               Perham Hall. The RP, Nicholas North, is the Hall Director for
               Perham Hall and was requesting contact at the front desk. I
               contacted North who told me the following; He said that two
               residents, Breanna Maples and Jessica Wheeler, contacted him
               regarding what they thought was a domestic dispute. Maples and
               Wheeler said that they were walking back to their room in 336
               from the showers when they heard what sounded like somebody
               being slammed into the wall, accompanied by screaming, yelling
               and crying in room 335. Maples and Wheeler said that was at
               about 9:10. North told me that he went up to room 335 to check
               on the resident as 9:40 and contacted Senaiet Zerom in that
               room. Zerom told North she was fine and nothing was going on.
               North said he then contacted the police about the incident. I
               arrived at about 0950 hours and spoke to North who provided the
               above information. I then went to room 336 where I contacted
               Maples and Wheeler. They told me that they were certain the
               fighting they heard was coming from room 335. They explained
               that the resident lives in the room alone and that she just
               moved in at the start of the semester. They said that she has a
               boyfriend but they did not know him. Maples and Wheeler stated
               that they could hear a male and female voice arguing and what
               sounded like a person being slammed into the wall. They said
               that they could not understand what was being said, but could
               tell it was an argument. I then went to room 335. I listened at
               the doorway for a few moments. I could only hear things being
               shuffled around inside the room, no voices. I knocked on the
               door and a male answered. I told him why I was there and asked
               to talk to him. He said that would be fine and invited me into
               the room, which he identified as his girlfriends room. The male
               identiifed himself as Yosief B. Tesfamariam. I asked where his
               girlfriend was and he said he thought she was in her cousin
               "Betty's" room. Once inside the room I activated my VieVu body
               camera and advised Yosief of this. Yosief said that he was not
               fighting with his girlfriend and the crying that was heard was
               him, because he just found out that his grandfather had passed
               away. He said he has been having a rough time and was just
               trying to get back to Shoreline. Yosief said that he has been
               dating Senaite Zerom for about 1 year. He said they were not
               fighting or arguing. He then asked to use the restroom. I asked

               North to escort him to the men's restroom, since he is not a
               student and is not allowed to be unescorted in the hall. North
               agreed and I went to find "Betty's" room. I found Betty and
               Senaiet in Perham room 304. I asked to come in to speak to
               Senaiet. I asked her what was going on today. She said she was
               fine and was just having an argument with Yosief about another
               male that has been contacting her. She said that it was only an
               argument and nothing got physical. She tried to assure me that
               she would call the police if she had any problems. I asked
               Senaiet if a family member of Yosief's had passed away. She
               said no, and got upset asking what that had to do with
               anything. I explained to her that is was Yosief told me was
               going on this morning. She then tried to backtrack and say that
               his grandma was sick, and dying. I could not see any phyical
               signs that Senaiet had been crying or upset or evidence of a
               physical altercation. I then spoke to Betheal "Betty" Kibreab,
               who said she was Senaiet's cousin, in the hallway. I asked her
               if Senaiet had told her anything else about what had happened
               this morning. She said no, that what Senaiet told me is all she
               knows. I then went back to room 335 to re-contact Yosief. He
               was not there. I then saw North who told me that Yosief left.
               Yosief and Senaiet both deny any type of physical altercation
               and I did not see any marks on either of them that would
               indicate otherwise. Verbal only. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 21st day of

               around for that and left the area. At that time, a paint truck
               arrived and I asked the painter if he had a spare bucket I
               could use for the squirrel. He advised that he did and provided
               me with an empty bucket. I swept the squirrel in the bucket and
               took it to the vet hospital for euthanasia. Nothing further. I

               Report of a hit and run collision which occurred around 1440
               hrs. The victim and vehicle were gone upon arrival. The suspect
               was contacted and counseled regarding what to do in the event
               of a collision. DRIVER 1: Wang, Xiaolei (04-12-92) VEHICLE 1:

               VEHICLE 2: Unknown INSURANCE: DAMAGE: WITNESS(ES): Sebastian,
               Lindsey A (04-05-93) NARRATIVE: On 04-21-15 around 1600 hrs I
               was told of a cold hit and run collision which had occurred in
               the Smith Center for Undergraduate Education (CUE) parking
               garage ). I contacted the complainant, later identified as
               Lindsey A Sebastian (04-05-93), and was told the following.
               Sebastian explained she was leaving the CUE parking garage
               around 1440 hrs when she saw a white vehicle (Wa. ATP0410)
               driven by an asian female backing out of a parking spot between
               the second and third floors. As this vehicle was backing out it
               struck the back bumper of a parked vehicle which was
               unoccupied. The driver then pulled out of and left the area
               before pulling over near the entrance. I asked Sebastian if she
               knew whether or not the driver had returned the vehicle it had
               struck. She told me she did not know and went on to tell me she
               left the area shortly after this. Around this point I asked her
               about the vehicle which had been struck and all she could tell
               me was it had been a gray smaller sedan, similar in style to a
               Honda Accord, and that it had white paint transfer on the
               bumper where it had been struck. Sebastian was not able to
               obtain the license plate before leaving. I thanked her for her
               time and contacted the owner of the white vehicle, later
               identified as Xiaolei Wang (04-12-92) and asked her about this
               incident. Wang told me she had been driving her vehicle but was
               not aware of striking or damaging another vehicle. I asked her
               where her vehicle was located, which she told me was at her
               apartment located at 2290 NE Westwood Dr, and she agreed to
               meet me there. Upon my arrival I contacted Wang at her
               apartment and we went out to her vehicle. Upon arriving at her
               vehicle I activated my camera and advised Wang the conversation
               was being recorded and asked her what had happened. She told me
               she did not realize she had hit a car and when asked if she
               knew what to do in the event of a collision she told me she
               didn't know. We discussed this as well as what had happened
               earlier. She again told me she did not realize she had struck
               another vehicle, but later admitted to having pulled over near

               the entrance to the garage due to her vehicle making an odd
               sound. I explained I had a witness who had seen her strike the
               gray vehicle before driving off as well as her vehicle leaving
               white paint transfer on the bumper of the other vehicle. We
               spoke about this before I examined her vehicle and noticed what
               appeared to be two small scuff marks on the passenger side rear
               bumper. Wang explained the vehicle was purchased used and may
               have had minor damage when she purchased it. I also noticed
               fresh damage to the passenger side rear door which extended
               down to the botton of the door and asked about it. She told me
               the damage had been from where she had struck a pole recently.
               We again spoke about the collision and the potential
               consequences for her actions. She told me she understood and
               then asked what was going to happen. I explained I was going to
               take photos of her vehicle and if a victim came forward to
               report the damage and I could link it back to her vehicle then
               I would cite her for hit and run. Wang and I continued to speak
               after which I gave her my business card along with the case
               number for reference. I explained to her I was going to take
               photos of her vehicle and she was free to leave if she wanted
               or she could remain until I finished. Wang left around this
               point and I completed taking photos of the vehicle before
               clearing. Upon my return to the WSU Police Department I
               completed the necessary paperwork and downloaded the photos
               before clearing the call. Until a victim and vehicle are
               identified I recommend this case be closed. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 21st day of April, 2015 in Pullman,

               with yellow powder in it. Entered into evidence for
               destruction. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 042215 at approximately 0033 hours I was
               dispatched to a suspicious call at Terrell Library. I was on
               foot in the area and arrived moments later. I met with a staff
               member at the front desk, Steve Overfelt, who referred me to
               Mataeo C. Strothers (091292). Strothers had found a clear glass
               vial with a black plastic top containing a tiny bit of a yellow
               powder. The vial was labeled "Pure" on white tape. Strothers
               took me to the basement near book rack 325. On the north side
               of the rack was a study desk that he found the vial on top of.
               He did not see anyone around when he found it. He found it at
               approximately 0025 hours. I seized the item and returned to the
               station and tested the substance. It tested negative for
               methamphetamines but test positive for Molly with a clear
               yellow result. The vial and substance weighed 7.31 grams. I
               entered the item in for destruction. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               22nd day of April, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1906 SYNOPSIS: Burglary alarm at the
               Outdoor Rec Center. Determined to be an alarm malfunction.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               04/22/15 at about 0227 hrs Dispatch toned out a burglary alarm
               at the outdoor rec center. Officer Westerman and I responded.
               We checked the building and found it secure. The alarm was
               triggered by the main entry door on the west side of the
               building. We had high winds at the time of the alarm and my
               experience has been that this alarm is prone to being activated
               by high winds moving the doors in the past. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 22 day of April, 2015, in Pullman,
