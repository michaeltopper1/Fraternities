               concerning a statement made by his ex-girlfriend. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: Richard Chen
               informed me he had broke up with girl friend, Emily Wang, a
               couple of days ago. When he spoke to her this morning, 4/7/15,
               about getting his keys back she stated he needed to come talk
               to her in person this afternoon at Regents Hall or she may kill
               herself. Chen said she has never said anything like this
               before, and is totally out of character for her. Chen was
               wanting advise on how to handle the situation. I asked Chen how
               he believed Wang would handle being contacted by the Police.
               Chen believed it would make things a lot worse. I asked Chen
               how he felt about meeting and talking with Wang this afternoon.
               Chen said he would be uncomfortable doing it alone, and he
               didn't have a friend who could be with him at this time. I
               asked Chen if he would be comfortable in contacting her if I
               was nearby, and ready to step in if necessary. Chen said that
               would make him feel better. Chen called Wang and agreed to meet
               her in the Regents Lobby in a few minutes. At this time I
               learned Wang does not live at Regents, she lives at Emerald
               Downs J203. She was at Regents because a friend lives there.
               Chen met Wang in the Regents Lobby, while I was near by. Chen
               and Wang talked for about 45 minutes. Afterwards I talked with
               Chen. Chen said Wang never brought up anything about hurting
               herself. Chen said their discussion was productive, and he felt
               better about the situation. After a discussion it was decided
               Police involvement would be not be necessary at this time. Chen
               said he would not hesitate to call police if Wang even hints
               she may hurt herself. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this ____ day of
