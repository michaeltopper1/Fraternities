    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: JAK/333 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1606 SYNOPSIS: Michael D. Goldsby called
               Whitcom wanting to report possible harassment via e-mail.
               Goldsby wanted a report created for documentation purposes
               only. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               04-06-15, Michael D. Goldsby (04-01-70) called Whitcom wanting
               to speak with an Officer about being harassed via e-mail. I
               responded to Goldsby's office (824 Johnson Tower) and asked him
               what I could do for him. Goldsby said he had received 3
               separate e-mails from someone identifying themselves as "D
               Money". G Money described himself as a former student of
               Goldsby's. G Money said he attended college in Wisconsin.
               Goldsby confirmed he had taught in Wisconsin as a Graduate
               Student. The e-mail messages G Money sent to Goldsby seem to
               relay being displeased with Goldsby giving him a "D" as his end
               of semester grade for a class. Goldsby doesn't remember giving
               any of his students a "D" and said he is not sure who the
               student is. G Money does not make any type of threatening
               statements in the e-mail messages he sent to Goldsby. It seems
               as if G Money is trying to "Brag" about how he has gone on to
               become successful and is trying to belittle Goldsby. Goldsby
               said he is not threatened or scared by the e-mail messages, but
               does want to create a Police report to "Document" the situation
               in case anything else happens. Nothing further at this time. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 7th day of April, 2015, in Pullman,

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1608 SYNOPSIS: Report of a door lock
               having possibly being damaged. The lock was found to be old and
               in need of being replaced, which was confirmed by housing
               maintenance. The malicious mischief was determined to be
               unfounded. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 04-06-15 around 1627 hrs I was dispatched to a
               report of a front door lock which was believed to have been
               damaged at apartment C-10 of the Columbia Apartments. I
               contacted the complainant, later identified as Antonio M
               Martinez (02-04-94), upon my arrival and was told the
               following. Martinez explained he had been having issues with
               his front door lock and believed it may have been damaged. He
               went on to tell me he had contacted Housing Maintenance, who
               had arrived prior to my arrival, and they believed the lock was
               simply old and in need of being replaced. After speaking with
               Martinez I briefly spoke with the Housing Maintenance personnel
               and they confirmed the lock simply appeared to be old and in
               need of being replaced. They went on to tell me they did not
               believe the issue to have been malicious in nature. I thanked
               them and cleared a short time later. The Malicious Mischief in
               this case was determined to be unfounded and I recommend this
               case be closed. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this ____ day of

               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 04-06-15, Donette called the
               WSU Police Department and informed me Judge Frazier had signed
               an order for Child Protective Services to remove Reah M. Becker
               (07-18-12) and Jason W. Becker (08-31-13) from the home they

               Samantha R. Wimberly (04-03-95). Donette works for CPS and
               believed the children were in danger if they remained in the
               home. Officer Welter and I responded to the "P" building of
               Steptoe Village and met Donette. She showed us a copy of the
               order issued by Judge Frazier. We walked to apartment P-101 and
               she knocked on the door. Charles Becker answered and allowed us
               to enter. Donette explained what was going to happen and
               Charles Becker, Samantha Wimberly, and Shanee Wimberly
               (Samantha's sister) began arguing with her. Donette tried
               explaining what was going on and eventually everyone calmed
               down. Samantha and Charles gather some clothes for Reah and
               Jason. They then walked Reah and Jason out to the CPS vehicle
               Donette was driving. They helped get Reah and Jason in carseats
               and Donette drove the children away. We cleared. I certify and

               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 04-06-15 around
               1932 hrs I was dispatched to a reported of a vehicle (Wa.
               ASG6637) which had been damaged while parked in the Holland
               Parking Garage. I contacted the reporting party, later
               identified as Algeiba B Bagabcad (08-31-93), and was told the
               following. Bagabcad explained she had parked her vehicle on the
               P-1 level of the Holland Parking Garage around 1745 hrs to take
               a test. At that time there were no other vehicles parked near
               her vehicle. When she returned around 1905 hrs she noticed a
               small dent near the handle of the rear drivers side door
               handle. She explained she believed this damage may have been
               intentional and I asked her why she believed that. She told me
               based upon the location of the damage she believed it had been
               intentional. I asked her where her vehicle was currently parked
               and she told me it was now in front of her apartment located at
               1401 NE Merman Dr. I arranged to meet her there and upon my
               arrival saw the damage she had described. The damage was a
               small dent, approximately the size of a quarter in size, and
               located just below the door handle and slightly to the rear of
               the driver side rear door. I examined the door for additional
               damage and located another small dent located on the same door,
               but lower down on the door near a crease and approximately 6
               inches from the original dent pointed out by Bagabcad. I
               photographed the damage, which showed no signs of paint
               transfer, and explained I believed the damage to have been
               caused by one car door opening into another. I asked Bagagcad
               if she had been anywhere else today where she would have parked
               near another vehicle. She told me around 1400 hrs she had
               parked in the Daggy Hall parking garage next to a smaller
               sedan. She went on and told me she was only there approximately
               30 minutes and upon her return a larger SUV had been parked in
               the spot next to her. When asked about the smaller sedan which
               had been parked near her Bagabcad could not provide any
               additional information. I provided Bagabcad with my business
               card and case number for reference and asked her to give me a
               call if she heard of anything which might be related to this
               case. She told me she would and I cleared a short time later. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 6th day of March, 2015, in Pullman,

               2328 hours I was dispatched to a drugs call at Goldsworthy Hall
               room 106. Upon arrival the RED on duty, Joshua B. McPhatter,
               stated that RA's found room 106 to smell of marijuana. I
               knocked on door 106 and Charles Lee Dallas Williams 11/01/95
               answered. I explained why I was called to his room. I told
               Williams that as long as he was willing to turn over all his
               marijuana and smoking devices I would just be referring my case
               to student conduct. Williams agreed and grabbed a glass stem
               for a bong that had been recently used to smoke marijuana with.
               Williams stated he did not smoke in his room but with friends
               somewhere else. Williams suspected that his clothing smelled of
               marijuana and that's why his room smelled of it. Williams
               appeared to be cooperative and forthcoming with the
               information. We walked to the dumpster where Williams destroyed
               the glass stem. I explained the student conduct process and
               thanked him for his cooperation. END OF REPORT I certify and

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1613 SYNOPSIS: Responded to Stephenson
               South 10th floor lounge for the odor of marijuana. Contacted
               two subjects, Teems and Anderssohn. Teems was warned for
               possession of marijuana. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR#
               1. Kenneth A. Teems/08-13-96 Student Conduct Possession of
               marijuana 2. NARRATIVE: On 04-07-15 at about 0003 hours I was
               dispatched to the report of the odor of marijuana emitting from
               the 10th floor lounge of Stephenson South. Whitcom advised that
               the RED on duty, Joshua B. McPhatter, was on scene requesting
               contact. I arrived on scene and contacted McPhatter on the 10th
               floor near the elevators. He showed me to the 10th floor
               lounge, which had the door closed. He told me that 2 people
               where in there. I opened the door and as soon as I did I could
               smell an overwhelming odor of fresh marijuana. The two males in
               the lounge were later identified as Kenneth A. Teems and
               Nicholas C. Anderssohn. I asked the two if they knew why I was
               there, they both said no. I told them it was because of the
               odor of marijuana and asked them if they had any marijuana.
               They both said no. As I stood in the room speaking to Teems and
               Anderssohn the odor seemed to be stronger on the side of the
               room Teems was sitting on. I asked them both for ID, which they
               provided. I asked if either had been contacted by the police
               regarding alcohol or drugs and they both said no. I asked if I
               could search their bags and they both gave me consent to
               search. Before I had a chance to actually search Teems, we
               started to take everything he had out of his coat pocket. I
               asked if I could check the coat, to make sure nothing was in
               the pockets and he handed the coat to me. Inside one of the
               pockets I found a green container with marijuana flakes inside.
               There was a lable indicating it was for "medical use only". I
               asked Teems if he has a medical marijuana card and he said no.
               I asked him why he did not remove it from his pocket when he
               took everything else out and he said he didn't know. I asked
               him where he got it and he told me "some guy" gave it to him.
               He said the container was empty when this mysterious person
               gave this conatiner to him. Teems also gave me permission to
               search his person. I found nothing of evidentiary value. I
               asked Anderssohn for permission to search his backpack, which
               he granted. No illegal items were found. I then asked Whitcom
               if either subject had any prior involvements regarding alcohol
               and/or drugs. I was told that Teems was contacted and warned
               for drugs in October 2014. I asked him why he lied to me about
               being contacted for drugs in the past and he said he did not

               know what I meant when I asked if he had been contacted by the
               police for alcohol or drugs. I told Teems that I would be
               forwarding charges to the Whitman County Prosecutor for
               possession of marijuana. I seized the green container with the
               marijuana flakes and told them both they were free to leave.
               After clearing the call I decided to only forward this case to
               student conduct, based on the actual amount of marijuana in the
               container. The container was procesed into evidence for
               destruction. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 7th day of
               April, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.
