               she smoked with and she gave me a glass pipe. I asked how much

               she could smell the odor of marijuana and knew it wasn't coming
               from her. She asked Nelson who admitted to smoking. I told
               Nelson I was not going to arrest her, but would have the school
               handle the situation. I brought the marijuana back to WSUPD and
               entered it into evidence for destruction. Nothing further. I

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC:MTK/336 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3138 SYNOPSIS: Unsecured roof hatch on
               the old steam plant. Building and roof checked, nothing found.
               Fac Ops was notified. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               2. NARRATIVE: On 07/21/15 at approximately 0210 hours I noticed
               an open roof hatch on the roof of the building to the north of
               the old steam plant. Ofc. Boyd and I checked the building and
               roof, but found nothing out of the ordinary. As we were
               leaving, I saw a fac ops employee pulling up to the steam
               plant. I told him that the roof hatch needs a pad lock and he
               said he would look into it. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               21st day of July, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.
