               subjects were already unstuck from elevator. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 07-21-15 at
               approximately 1249 hours I was dispatched to the report of two
               subjects stuck in elevator #2 in Orton Hall, located at 1475 SE
               Olympia Ave. Dispatch advised they were notifying WSU
               Facilities Operations. I arrived on scene. I checked both
               elevators and they were both clear and functional. As I was
               leaving I spoke to a custodian who told me it was two of her
               employees that were stuck on the elevator. I went and spoke
               with Shane L. Sniff (DOB 09-01-92) and Marissa A. Priest (DOB
               02-21-97). I asked them if they could tell me what happened.
               Sniff told me they both got onto the elevator on the 12th floor
               and once they got on it took a few seconds for the door to
               close. He said the door closed almost all the way, but not
               quite. Sniff said he pressed the door closed button and the
               door finally shut, but the elevator was not moving. Sniff said
               they were stuck about 5 minutes before the WSU Facilities
               Operations worker was able to get them free. I cleared the
               scene. No further action. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 21st day of July,
               2015, in Pullman, Washington.
