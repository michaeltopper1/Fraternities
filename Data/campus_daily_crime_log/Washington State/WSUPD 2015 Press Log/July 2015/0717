               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3096 SYNOPSIS: Subject reporting
               telephone harassment. Officer determined there was no crime.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 07-17-
               15 I received information about a possible telephone harassment
               that was occurring. At about 0943 hours I called Derek G.
               Wallace (DOB 06-19-73) on the phone to see if he wanted to file
               a police report. I told Wallace I was calling because I heard
               he was receiving harassing phone calls and I wanted to know
               what was going on. Wallace told me he is completing a couple
               different public records request through Washington State
               University and he received a phone call from someone that
               received a copy of his request. Wallace said he was unaware
               that everyone involved in the request would be notified and
               provided with his contact information. He said on 07-10-15 at
               about 1303 hours he received a phone call from (208) 874-7144
               on his cell phone while at his residence located at, 935 B. St.
               Wallace said the caller was upset and with a loud voice was
               complaining about the public records request he received. He
               told Wallace he did not have any right to have access to that
               information. Wallace said he tried to explain to the male on
               the phone that the request was not directed at him and that he
               was doing research. He said the male would not calm down and
               told Wallace he would be calling his attorney. Wallace told me
               he did not think the phone call was going anywhere, so he just
               hung up the phone. Wallace said later that day he saw another
               call coming in from the (208) 874-7144 number. He said he did
               not answer the phone, but sent a text to the number at about
               1333 hours saying "Don't call my number again". The male
               replied back at about 1428 hours saying "Don't threaten me!".
               Wallace said he replied "Don't call my number again..I have
               called the cops..". He said he received a response at about
               1431 hours saying "Go ahead. I wasn't threatening you. I am
               just concerned about my privacy. You won't hear from me again".
               Wallace said he has not heard from the male again. I asked
               Wallace if he was threatened at all, and he said no. He just
               said the male was upset and talking with a loud voice. I asked
               him what the public requests were for and he said he is looking
               for patterns in shared leave at WSU. He told me he has
               requested records from year 2004-2010. I asked him if he knew
               the male on the other line, and he said no. I told Wallace
               there is no crime, but I would try calling the number and
               talking to the male about the public records request. At about
               1006 hours I called the number, but there was no answer. There

               construction sign) were recovered at Chief Joseph Apartment
               E15. The stop sign was returned to the WSU sign shop and the

               hours, I received an email from Lt. Larsen regarding a WSU
               facilities operations employee noticing two signs on the back
               porch of Chief Joseph Apartment E15. I responded to E15 and
               noticed an orange "Motorcycles use extreme caution" sign and a
               stop sign on a black post sitting on the porch. I contacted WSU
               Housing who advised that Victor M. Servin and Matteo Molieri
               were the residents who lived in E15. I contacted Servin who
               told me that he and his roommate work for housing and saw the
               signs near their dumpster around the beginning of June and
               thought they were cool, so they put them on their porch. I
               explained that the construction sign likely belonged to a
               construction company and that the stop sign likely belonged to
               WSU. Servin gave me permission to go onto his deck and recover
               the sign. I recovered the signs and noticed that Northstar
               Enterprises had a label on the back of the construction sign. I
               contacted the company and advised them that I had recovered the
               sign and they told me they would send someone to the WSU Police
               Department to recover the sign in the next week. Ofc. Tiengo
               transported the stop sign to the WSU Sign shop and the
               construction sign to the WSU Police Department vehicle bay for
               Northstar Enterprises. Nothing further. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
