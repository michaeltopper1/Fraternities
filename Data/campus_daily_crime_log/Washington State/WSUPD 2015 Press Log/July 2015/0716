               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3085 SYNOPSIS: Report of a lost credit
               card machine from WSU Athletics. No suspects or leads at this
               time. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               07-16-15 at approximately 1028 hours I was dispatched to the
               report of a lost credit card machine from WSU Athletics,
               located at 1455 NE Cougar Way in Bohler Gymnasium. Dispatch
               advised the complainant, Leslie M. Johnson (DOB 08-29-55) was
               requesting phone contact. I called Johnson on the phone.
               Johnson is the WSU Athletics Associate Director of Business.
               She told me the WSU Event Staff hosts events all over the
               state, and they think their mobile credit card machine was lost
               at one of the events. She described it as being a silver and
               grey XAC First Data cellular powered credit card machine
               (serial #WT0400005274) (model #R-FD400GTGTRS). Johnson said the
               credit card machine was leased from Bank of America and the
               estimated value is $1,500.00. She told me the Event Staff
               thinks they last saw it sometime between an event they had in
               the Tri-Cities and Portland. They were in the Tri-Cities on 05-
               29-15 and think it was lost or misplaced around 2200 hours.
               Johnson said they were in Portland the next day on 05-30-15.
               She mentioned the WSU Event Staff noticed it missing on 06-05-
               15. Johnson thinks it was probably packed away into the wrong
               box, but they do not believe it was stolen. Johnson emailed me
               photos of a similar credit card reader they have, and the
               photos have been uploaded into Spillman. I told Johnson to
               notify me if they find it, and she said she would. No further
               action at this time. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 16th day of July,
               2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               that was maliciously discharged in Eastlick Hall, located at

               #239 and the custodian was on scene for contact. I arrived on
               scene. I contacted the custodian, Jolanda A. Whitacre (DOB 04-
               14-58), and her supervisor Rebecca S. Beach (DOB 12-05-57).
               They showed me the fire extinguisher on the second floor that
               was in between room #290 and #288. There was a red, Amerex fire
               extinguisher (Serial #A00726) that was hanging on it's hook.
               There was a small amount of foam that had been discharged from
               the fire extinguisher onto the tile floor. The blue seal was
               broken, but the pin had been put back into the fire
               extinguisher handle. Whitacre told me that was how they found
               it and nothing was cleaned up. Whitacre told me she was cleaned
               she left Eastlick Hall around 1330 hours on 07-16-15 and the
               fire extinguisher had not been discharged. She told me she
               noticed it this morning at about 0605 hours this morning.
               Eastlick Hall is locked up at 2100 hours. Whitacre told me she
               did not hear anyone setting off a fire extinguisher yesterday.
               She also mentioned all of the other floors are fine. Beach told
               me she would check with the night shift supervisor to see if
               they noticed the fire extinguisher when they were locking up
               last night on 07-16-15. I took photographs of the fire
               extinguisher and the damage. The photos have been uploaded into
               Spillman. I cleared the scene. I returned to the WSU Police
               Station where the fire extinguisher was dusted for prints.
               However, I was unable to lift any from the fire extinguisher. I
               called WSU Life Safety to have the fire extinguisher recharged.
               No suspects or leads at this time. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 17th day of
