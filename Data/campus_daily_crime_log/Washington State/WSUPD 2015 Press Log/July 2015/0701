    Narrative: RVWD: dd/329 OFC: DBT/321 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2927 SYNOPSIS: Subject reporting dog was
               left in a parked vehicle in the grey lot by the Stephenson
               Complex. Officer responded and located the owner of the dog.
               The dog was let out of the vehicle. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 07-01-15 at approximately 1149
               hours I was dispatched to a report of a dog locked in a parked
               vehicle, located at 1265 SE Stadium Way. The outside temp was
               approximately 87 degrees at the time. I arrived in the area. I
               located a tan, 2012 Hyundai Tucson (WV Lic. DLE617) parked in
               the grey lot by Stephenson with a large dog in the front seat.
               The vehicle was parked in a shaded spot under some trees and
               the windows were slightly rolled down. The dog appeared fine at
               the moment, but due to the temperature I wanted to find the
               owner. I walked around the Stephenson Complex until I located
               the owner, Dustin L. Cooper (DOB 05-23-88), of the dog. I
               explained to Cooper the reason I was there. Cooper told me he
               left his dog in the vehicle because he was moving in and
               animals are not allowed inside. Cooper apologized and let his
               dog out of the vehicle. I cleared the scene. No further action.
               I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws
               of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 1st day of July, 2015, in Pullman,
