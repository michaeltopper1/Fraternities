               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 07-09-15 at about 0811
               hours a female approached me and told me there was a dead bird
               on the stairs and wanted to know if I could help her with it.
               She walked me over to Kruegel Hall, located at 1359 SE Stadium
               Way and there was a dead bird on the east entrance stairs.
               There was another female standing by the stairs, who later
               identified herself as Jan M. Stephens (DOB 10-29-54). Stephens
               said they wanted to move the bird with a stick, but could not
               find one. I put on a pair of gloves and moved the dead bird to
               some nearby bushes. I later returned with a garbage bag to
               place the bird in, and I disposed of the dead bird in a nearby

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Boyd/335 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3013 SYNOPSIS: Someone trespassed in
               Daggy Hall and maliciously discharged a fire extinguisher,
               causing a fire alarm to activate. No suspects at this time.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               07/10/15 at about 0204 hrs Dispatch toned Pullman Fire to a
               fire alarm at Daggy Hall. Officer Whitman responded and a short
               time later advised he could see what looked like smoke inside
               on the 2nd floor. I responded to assist. Pullman Fire
               investigated and discovered a Coors Light beer can, and a
               location where a fire extinguisher had been discharged inside
               the building. They advised they thought there was some smoke in
               addition to the dust from the fire extinguisher but they were
               unable to locate any source for the smoke. The smoke/haze
               dissipated and Officer Whitman photographed the location of the
               fire extinguisher discharge, including a Nike tennis shoe foot
               print in the dust from the extinguisher. We began searching the
               building for the fire extinguisher or a location with a missing
               fire extinguisher. We located a fire extinguisher which had
               been discharged along with a blonde wig in the west stairwell
               on the 2nd floor. The fire extinguisher was collected as
               evidence. We were unable to locate an empty fire extinguisher
               location and at this time do not know where the extinguisher
               was taken from. It is labeled as a WSU extinguisher with a
               serial number A02857. I will have dayshift contact WSU life
               safety to try and determine where the extinguisher came from. I
               contacted the WSU Fire Marshall and notified him of the
               incident. Pullman Fire silenced the fire alarm and I had
               Whitcom notify WSU Facilities they could come clean up the mess
               any time and if they needed assistance resetting the alarm to
               contact Pullman Fire. I returned to the WSU Police Station
               where the fire extinguisher was dusted for prints. I was able
               to lift two partial prints from the extinguisher. At this time
               I do not believe it to be cost effective to send the prints to
               be analyzed unless we encounter further crimes of a similar
               nature. The prints will be logged as evidence with the fire
               extinguisher. More to follow. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 10 day of
               July, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.
