               to the prosecutor pending the toxicology lab results. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Christopher M. Bell 01/12/94
               Charges Forwarded DUI 2. NARRATIVE: On July 12th, 2015 at
               approximately 0036 hours I was monitoring traffic on Merman
               Drive from Garden Ave when I noticed a white Jaguar sedan
               accelerating northbound on Merman Drive at a high rate of
               speed. I activated my handheld radar (Decatur Scout 2013) and
               obtained a reading of 40 MPH in the posted 25 MPH zone. I
               pulled onto Merman Drive and attempted to catch up to the car.
               I started to catch up to the Jaguar at the intersection of
               Merman Drive and Terre View. I had my emergency lights on and I
               turned on my siren at the intersection. The Jaguar was still
               heading northbound on Merman Drive at what appeared to be
               visually around 40 to 45 MPH. I caught up to the Jaguar as it
               slowed and turned into the Cougar Crest Apartment Complex. I
               exited the car and ordered the driver to put his hands out the
               window. The driver complied. I walked up to the driver and
               asked if the driver had seen my lights and heard my siren. The
               driver, later identified as Christopher Martin Bell 01/12/94
               said he did just as he pulled into the parking lot. I asked for
               Bell's driver's license, proof of insurance, and vehicle
               registration. As Bell grabbed his driver's license I noticed
               his movements were slow and deliberate. I could smell the very
               strong odor of intoxicants coming from the car. Bell was the
               only occupant of the vehicle. Bell handed me his WADL which
               identified him as 21 years old. I asked Bell if he had his
               vehicle registration and proof of insurance. I noticed Bell's
               eyes were watery, bloodshot, and glassy looking. Bell had a
               dazed look upon his face. About this time Ofc. Whitman arrived
               on scene. I asked Bell to come talk to me outside his car. Bell
               exited and I noticed he appeared to unsteady on his feet. I
               told Bell to stand near his bumper. Bell walked to where I told
               him and stumbled slightly as he stopped walking. Bell then
               grabbed his cigarettes from his shirt pocket and I told him he
               could not smoke right now. I noticed Bell's face was sweaty
               even though it was approximately 62 degrees outside. I asked
               Bell where he was coming from and he said Mikes Bar. I asked
               Bell if he was willing to do some voluntary field sobriety
               tests. Bell asked what would happen if he did not do the tests.
               I told Bell that I would have to make my decision based on my
               observations so far. Bell said he did not want to do the tests.

               I told Bell that he was under arrest for DUI and handcuffed
               (D/L) him. I told Bell that he was being audio and video
               recorded and read him his Miranda Rights of my department
               issued card. Bell stated he understood his rights. As I was
               reading the Miranda rights Ofc. Boyd arrived on scene. Ofc.
               Boyd went to the passenger side of the car and found a large
               section of red paint transfer on the white car. Bell was asked
               what he hit and Bell said, "that's not mine." I told Bell that
               his vehicle was going to be towed and wanted to know if there
               was anything in the car he wanted out of it. Bell asked for his
               wallet, keys, and cell phone. Ofc. Whitman stayed with the
               vehicle and I transported Bell to Pullman Police Department for
               BAC. Upon arrival I checked the Draeger and found it working
               properly and the mouth tube warm to the touch. At 0058 hours I
               checked Bell's mouth finding no foreign substances. I read Bell
               his Constitutional Rights at 0100 hours. Bell stated he
               understood his rights and signed he understood his rights and
               decided not to exercise his rights. I read Bell the Implied
               Consent Warning for Breath and Bell signed that it had been
               read to him at 0102 hours. Bell checked the no box that he was
               not willing to provide a breath sample. I told Bell that I
               would be applying for a search warrant for his blood. I placed
               Bell in a holding cell and returned to the station. I applied
               for and was granted a search warrant for Bell's blood by Judge
               Robinson. At 0251 hours I arrived back at the holding facility
               to serve the search warrant. Pullman Fire Department responded
               for the blood draw. I read a copy of the search warrant to Bell
               and the paramedics. Once complete both parties were provided
               with copies of the search warrant. I watched as paramedic
               Joseph Branson swabbed the side of Bell's left arm with 1%
               iodine. I watched as Branson drew blood into the two grey top
               vials. Bell's blood was taken at 0301 hours which was 2 hours
               and 24 minutes after Bell had stopped driving. I provided Bell
               and the medics with the following paperwork: search warrant,
               return of search warrant, and receipt of property taken form. I
               told Bell that his blood would be sent to the state toxicology
               lab for analysis. Bell was fingerprinted and photographed. I
               provided Bell a copy of the following documents: Driver's
               Hearing Request, Notice of Hearing/Conditions of Release, tow
               and impound form, and the breath test document. I told Bell
               that pending the toxicology results, I would be forwarding
               charges of DUI to the prosecutor. Bell's vehicle was impounded
               by Myers Towing for 12 hours. My VieVu camera footage was
               uploaded to the department's computer. END OF REPORT I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3028 SYNOPSIS: WCSO requested assistance

               custody. He was booked into jail on a DV related charge.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Dillon P. Cooper
               (091192) Booked 2. NARRATIVE: On 071215 at approximately 0144
               hours WCSO requested assistance in Albion with a Disorderly
               subject. Ofc. Whitman, Deputy DeRosier, Reserve Deputy Kinonen,
               and I responded. When I arrived Deputy DeRosier and Reserve
               Deputy Kinonen were detaining Dillon P. Cooper (091192) at gun
               point as there had been concern of access to an AR-15. He was
               handcuffed without incident and placed in the back of Deputy
               DeRosier's vehicle. Our weapons were drawn covering other areas
               as we did not know at the time if Cooper was the only subject
               involved or if he was the specific subject we were looking for.
               I stayed and monitored him until Ofc. Whitman was free to watch
               him. I then went inside the home. An unidentified juvenile,
               Hunter, was in the house while the Deputies were interviewing
               and recounting unpleasant events, so I had Hunter hang out with
               me on the front porch and talk about unrelated topics. Sgt.
               Brown showed up and we cleared. I later heard on the radio that
               Collins was in custody and being transported to Whitman County
               Jail. Nothing follows. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 12th day of July,
