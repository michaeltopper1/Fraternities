    Narrative: RVWD: dd/329 OFC: ENW/328 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3240 SYNOPSIS: Request for a civil stand
               by for the removal of items from an apartment. Assistance was
               provided without incident. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR#
               1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 07/28/15 around 0926 hrs I was dispatched
               to a request for a civil stand by for apartment E-28 of the
               Chinook apartments. I contacted the reporting party, later
               identified as Robert B Tattershall (02/28/57) and was told the
               following. Tattershall explained he would like assistance with
               a resident of apartment E-28 of the Chinook Apartments. He went
               on to explain the resident, Rundong Zheng, had been given
               several opportunities to remove his items from the apartment
               and on each occasion had told Tattershall he would have the
               items removed. Tattershall went on to tell me the apartment was
               scheduled to be rented out and it needed to be cleaned.
               Tattershall had arranged for some housing employees to box and
               remove the remainder of the items in the apartment, but
               requested law enforcement in the event Zheng had an issue. We
               spoke about what time he would be ready and he told me he would
               have to check and let me know. A short time later I was told by
               Whitcom, Tattershall would like to begin moving items around
               1315 hrs. Upon my arrival I noticed Tattershall and his
               employees were already in the apartment. I briefly spoke with
               Tattershall who told me Zheng was not home and they would
               continue cleaning out the apartment. I told him if Zheng
               returned and there was an issue to give me a call and I would
               return. I was told he would and I cleared a short time later.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 28th day of July, 2015, in
               Pullman, Washington. _______________________________________

               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Isaac H. Williams/11-05-94
               Warned MIP Exhibiting None 2. NARRATIVE: On 07-29-15 at about
               0002 hours I was on patrol, traveling eastbound on Valley Rd
               near the playfields, when I observed a male walking on the
               sidewalk. He caught my attention because he was wearing a tie-
               dyed tank top and staggering from side to side and he walked. I
               drove past the male and turned into the playfield parking lot
               at Valley and Orchard. I waited for the male to pass my
               location but never saw him. A couple minutes passed when I saw
               the same male emerge from the intersection of Cove Way and
               Orchard Dr. I watched as the male staggered, tripped on the
               concrete retaining wall, then fall into the weeds. He got up
               and it looked like he was trying to run but was very slow,
               staggering all over the sidewalk, nearly falling into the
               street. I caught up to the male on Orchard Dr near the rear
               entrance to the SRC. I activated my VieVu camera and asked if I
               could talk to him. The male stopped but almost fell into the
               street. I asked him to sit on the retaining wall so he wouldn't
               fall. I noticed he had small lacerations on his shoulder and
               knee with blood on his hand. I asked if he was ok and he said
               yes. I asked if he had been in a fight and he said no. As the
               male spoke I could smell a very strong odor of alcohol on his
               breath and his speech was extrememly slow and slurred. I asked
               the male for his ID, which he provided. His WADL identified him
               as Isaac H. Williams. I noticed that Williams is 20 years old.
               I asked him how much he had to drink and he said he did not
               know. I asked where he was drinking and he said with friends,
               but would not tell me where or that he did not know where. He
               told me he was walking home to Maple St. Williams told me that
               his last drink had been about 1 hour ago. He was able to answer
               most of my questions. I told Williams that I would be giving
               him a warning for MIP Exhibiting but the information would be
               sent to Student Conduct. Coropral Kuhrt then provided a
               courtesy transport home for Williams. Once there he was met by
               a roommate who agreed to watch after Williams for the night.
               Williams was very polite throughout my contact with him.
               Student Conduct only. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 29th day of July,

               On 07/29/15 at approximately 0020 hours I was turning out of
               the parking lot behind Streit-Perham onto NE Stadium Way. The
               defendant's vehicle was traveling north on Stadium Way and I
               waited until the vehicle passed to pull onto Stadium Way. The
               vehicle then turned left and I thought the left brake light was
               out. I turned onto N Fairway in an effort to find the vehicle
               and confirm. As I drove by Fairway Rd. I noticed the
               defendant's vehicle and quickly pulled into the grey parking
               lot and "blacked" out. I went to the other end of the parking
               lot and began to walk towards the vehicle. The vehicle then
               left the parking lot. I was able to catch up to the vehicle as
               it turned left onto NE Stadium Way from NE N. Fairway. I
               noticed the the driver's side brake light did not illuminate
               when the other two brake lights did. I activated my emergency
               lights, stopping the vehicle near Martin stadium. I activated
               my VieVu camera and contacted the driver. I told the driver the
               reason for the stop as well as that the stop was being
               recorded. I asked the driver for his license, registration, and
               insurance. The driver provided me with his Idaho license,
               identifying him as Cory J. Dickinson 08/26/89. Dickinson could
               not find his current registration or insurance. I returned to
               my patrol car and ran Dickinson through Whitcom. Whitcom
               radioed that Dickinson was clear in Idaho, but suspended 2nd in
               Washington. I completed a criminal citation for DWLS 2nd. I
               explained the citation to Dickinson and provided him a copy. I
               parked Dickinson's vehicle in the lot on the north side of
               Vogel hall per his request. Nothing Further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               29th day of July, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               and released for DUI and DWLS. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Marlin R. Guillen 08/24/93 Process/cite DUI &
               DWLS C09953 2. NARRATIVE: On 07/29/15 at approximately 0130
               hours I was parked in the parking lot of Kamiak Apts off of NE
               Valley Rd at the M building. I was perpendicular to the roadway
               and monitoring traffic on Valley and Brandi Way. I saw the
               defendant's vehicle traveling eastbound on Valley Rd.
               approaching my location. I activated my handheld radar (Genesis
               Scout) and it displayed a speed reading of 33MPH in a 25MPH
               speed zone. I got behind the defendant's vehicle and activated
               my emergency lights as we turned north on NE Merman Dr. The
               defendant came to a stop in the parking lot of Terrace Apts. I
               turned on my VieVu camera. As I was walking up to the
               defendant's vehicle I noticed the back window rolled down
               first, then the front one. I contacted the driver and told her
               the reason for the stop and that I was recording. I asked the
               driver for her license, registration, and proof of insurance.
               The driver provided me with her passport. The driver began by
               looking for the registration and insurance. I noticed while she
               was going through the paperwork, papers were slipping from her
               fingers and falling. I also could see the registration, but the
               driver never gave it to me. The passport identified the driver
               as Marlin R. Guillen 08/24/93. Guillen told me that she did not
               have her insurance. I asked Guillen about the vehicle
               registration and she said her mom had it. While Guillen was
               talking her words sounded slow and slurred. I could smell the
               odor of intoxicants coming from the vehicle while I was
               speaking with Guillen (the sole occupant of the vehicle). I
               asked Guillen how much she had to drink and she said 1 beer a
               few hours prior. I asked Guillen if I could check her eyes and
               she said I could. I administered an HGN test with Guillen
               seated in the vehicle. I saw a lack of smooth pursuit in both
               eyes and noticed they were bloodshot and watery. I returned to
               my patrol car and turned off my front facing emergency lights.
               I ran Guillen through Washington on my MDC and she returned
               suspended 3rd. I returned to Guillen's vehicle and confirmed
               that she had 1 beer. I asked Guillen would do some field
               sobriety tests to make sure she could get home and that she
               wasn't impaired by the alcohol she consumed. Guillen said she
               would and exited the vehicle. I directed Guillen to the parking
               lot which has a paved and level surface. I told Guillen that
               all of the tests were voluntary and she said she understood. I

               administered the field sobriety tests in the parking lot. The
               weather was clear with an approximate temperature of 58
               degrees. Guillen was wearing yoga pants, a t-shirt, a long
               sleeved t-shirt, and sandals during the tests. Lighting was
               provided by overhead lights and my flashlight. The first test I
               administered was the HGN. I told Guillen to follow the tip of
               my pen with her eyes only with out moving her head. I held my
               pen approximately 12-15 inches in front of Guillen's face and
               administered the test. I checked Guillen's eyes and noticed
               they tracked equally and that her pupils were equal in size. I
               did not see resting nystagmus in either eye. I saw a lack of
               smooth pursuit and a distinct and sustained nystagmus at
               maximum deviation in both eyes. I saw an onset of nystagmus at
               approximately 40 degrees in both eyes. I noticed Guillen was
               swaying left to right during the test. Sgt. Griffin arrived on
               scene around this time. The next test I administered was the
               walk and turn. I told Guillen to find an imaginary straight
               line and put her left foot on the line. I told Guillen to put
               her right foot in front of her left foot touching heel to toe
               and leave her arms down at her sides. I told Guillen to stay in
               that position while I explained the test. I told Guillen that
               when I tell her to begin, to take nine steps touching heel to
               toe, watching her feet as she walked and count each step out
               loud. I told Guillen that when she gets to step nine, to leave
               her lead foot in place and using her rear foot, take small
               steps around until facing the way she came. I told Guillen to
               take nine steps back touching heel to toe and counting each
               step out loud. I told Guillen that once she started, do not
               stop. I reminded Guillen to count each step out loud, keep her
               arms at her sides, and watch her feet as she walked. I
               demonstrated the test and asked Guillen if she understood and
               she said yes. I told Guillen to begin at any time. First Nine
               Steps: Guillen began the test and stepped off the line to the
               left on step 1 and missed heel to toe between steps 2 & 3.
               Guillen completed the turn and stopped before beginning her
               return steps. Return Nine Steps: Guillen stepped off the line
               to the right on step 2 and missed heel to toe between steps 5 &
               6 and 7 & 8. The next test I administered was the one leg
               stand. I told Guillen to stand with her feet together and her
               arms down at her sides. I told Guillen that when I tell her to
               begin to raise the foot of her choice approximately 6 inches
               off the ground. I told Guillen to point her toe forward, look
               at her foot, and count out loud by 1000's until I tell her to
               stop. I asked Guillen if she understood, and she said yes. I
               told Guillen to begin at any time. Guillen raised her right
               foot approximately 1 inch off the ground and began the test. I
               reminded Guillen to raise her foot 6 inches, which she then
               did. Guillen was swaying left to right during the test and was
               leaning to her left. Guillen was not looking at her foot, which
               I reminded her to do. Guillen skipped count 1017 and thirty
               seconds elapsed on her count of 1020. The next test I
               administered was the PBT. I asked Guillen if she would submit
               to a PBT and she said yes. I checked the PBT (FST # 62324) and
               found it in proper working condition. Guillen gave a breath
               sample of .129 at 0147 hours. At this time it was my opinion

               that Guillen's ability to drive was impaired by alcohol. I told
               Guillen she was under arrest for DUI. I handcuffed (D/L)
               Guillen and advised her of her right counsel and reminded her
               that I was recording. I placed Guillen in the back seat of my
               patrol car and retrieved her purse and registration from the
               vehicle. Sgt. Griffin remained on scene and facilitated the tow
               with Myer's towing. I transported Guillen to Pullman PD for the
               BAC. I read Guillen her Miranda Rights which she said she
               understood and would answer my questions. Upon arrival I
               checked the Draeger and found it working properly with the
               mouth tube warm to the touch. I read Guillen her Constitutional
               Rights at 0202 hours. Guillen said she understood her rights
               and signed both signature blocks. I checked Guillen's mouth at
               0202 hours, finding no foreign substance. I read Guillen her
               Implied Consent Warning at 0204 hours. Guillen signed that it
               was read to her. I asked Guillen if she would submit to a
               breath test. Guillen checked the "yes' box and initialed next
               to it. I asked Guillen if she understood the implied consent
               warnings and she said she did. Guillen provided a breath sample
               of .120 IR / .121 EC at 0222 hours. Guillen provided a breath
               sample of .120 IR / .120 EC at 0225 hours. The breath test was
               administered in accordance to the methods approved by the
               Washington State Toxicologist pursuant to the Washington
               Administrative Code. I provided Guillen with a copy of the
               following documents: Driver's Hearing Request, Notice of
               Hearing/Conditions of Release, Tow/impound Form, and the breath
               test document. I issued Guillen a criminal citation for DUI and
               DWLS. I explained the citation to Guillen and provided her a
               copy. Guillen was released from custody and I gave her a
               courtesy transport home. Guillen was polite and cooperative
               during my contact with her. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 29th day of July,
               2015, in Pullman, Washington.
