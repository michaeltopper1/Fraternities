               dispatched to a report of a cat and several kittens hiding in
               the bushes near Spokane St and Washington St. I contacted the
               reporting party, later identified as Amy E Snively Martinez
               (01/16/77), who told me the following. Snively Martinez told me
               she had been heading to class when she noticed a cat and
               several kittens hiding in the bushes near Spokane St and
               Washington St. She went on to say they did not appear to be in
               any sort of distress and the kittens seemed to be well taken
               care of. I told her I would check on them and we concluded our
               call a short time later. Upon arriving in the area the cat and
               kittens appeared to be be gone. I cleared the call a short time
               later. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: JAK/333 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3045 SYNOPSIS: A WSU Student stated
               someone broke into his room in McEachern North sometime between
               07-10-15 at 1500 hours and 07-13-15 at 0100 hours. Nothing was
               taken from the room. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 07-13-15, I responded to the McEachern Hall lobby
               to meet with the Residential Educational Director, Joshua B.
               McChatter. McChatter had an Asian male in his office, who I
               later identified as Chengxu Heilongjiang (04-27-94).
               Heilongjiang stated he returned to his room (McEachern North,
               310) at approximately 0100 hours and realized someone had pried
               the screen from his window and may have entered his room. I
               asked him if we could go see his room. When we entered the
               room, Heilongjiang showed me his window. The screen was not
               fully seated in the window and looked as if someone could have
               taken it off of the window and partially placed it back when
               they were done. I also saw what appeared to be a palm and index
               finger print on the dusty wood window ledge inside the room.
               The surface was such that I could not get any type of print.
               The window was at ground level and I did not see any signs of
               footprints outside of the window. Heilongjiang said he left
               Pullman at 1500 hours on 07-10-15 and went to Portland. He
               returned at 0100 hours on 07-13-15 to find the screen only
               partially attached to the window. He said nothing was taken
               from his room. He left his MacBook Pro in his room and that
               also was not taken. He did not have a next door neighbor and
               has no idea of who knew he was leaving for the weekend or who
               may have wanted to get into his room. McChatter stated
               Heilongjiang was being moved to Orton Hall as a precaution. I
               gave both Heilongjiang business cards with the Police Case
               Number. I told Heilongjiang he could call me if he realized
               something was missing from his room. I advised McChatter he
               should contact WSU Housing to see if some type of brace could
               be installed on the windows so they would not open wide enough
               for a person to enter a room. I took photos of the palm and
               index finger print as well as of the window and screen. The
               photos have been downloaded onto the WSU Police Computer System
               in the "Files" section of the case. Nothing further at this
               time. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the
               laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this ____ day of _____________, 2015, in
               Pullman, Washington. _______________________________________

               $900.00 WITNESS(ES): None NARRATIVE: On 07/13/15 around 1146
               hrs I was dispatched to a report of a two car non injury
               collision on the South side of Johnson Tower. I located both
               vehicles in the parking lot between Johnson Tower and Troy Hall
               upon my arrival and contact a male, later identified as
               Timurgali Ismailov (01/13/76), who told me the following.
               Ismailov explained he was working for Facilities Operations
               when he was backing his work vehicle (Wa. 19407E) from behind
               Johnson Tower. As he began to back into a vacant handicap
               parking spot to turn around he struck the front drivers side
               headlight and hood of a parked vehicle (Wa. 410NUM). The result
               of the collision was a broken headlight and damage to the hood
               near the headlight assembly. I went to look at the vehicle
               Ismailov had backed into and noticed the front headlight lens
               was shattered and pushed back towards the engine compartment.
               In addition I could see where a section of the hood had been
               bent around where the headlight would sit. I returned to my
               vehicle and later photographed the damage to both vehicles
               before returning to Ismailov. Upon returning to Ismailov I gave
               him my business card along with the case number for reference.
               I later contacted the owner of the other vehicle, later
               identified as Raymond M Quock (06/09/48), who met me at his
               vehicle a short time later. I explained what had happened to
               his vehicle and after obtaining his information gave him my
               business card along with the case number for reference. Shortly
               after this I answered the remainder of his questions and
               cleared. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 13th day of July,
