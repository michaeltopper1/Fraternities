    Narrative: RVWD: 316 / OFC: dd/329 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3262 SYNOPSIS: Report of a dog bite.
               Incident documented. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 07-30-15 at approximately 0933 hours, I contacted
               Dustin Cooper (RED of Stephenson South) reference a report of
               his dog, Xavier, biting another RED. I asked Dustin to tell me
               what happened and he stated on the night of July 17th around
               1900 hours, he was in his apartment at Stephenson South, along
               with his girlfriend, and RED Acacia Kapusta. Dustin stated
               Xavier had not been fed yet as they had been at training all
               day. He said he fed Xavier and while he was eating, some of his
               food had fallen out of the bowl. Acacia had reached down to
               pick up the food and as she put it back in the bowl, Xavier
               lunged towards her. Acacia pulled away and as she did, Xavier
               bit her right arm. He stated they immediately put Xavier in the
               bathroom. Acacia had a small puncture wound from the bite, and
               because the wound started hurting and she was bleeding, she had
               them take her to the ER to be examined. The wound was cleaned,
               bandaged, and she was released. There were no stitches. Dustin
               stated Xavier had never bitten anyone like that, but had nipped
               before. He also stated Xavier has been adjusting to the new
               surroundings, being inside, and he was just neutered. I
               verified Xavier had all of his vaccinations. I later
               interviewed Acacia who provided the same story. She stated she
               didn't want anything to happen and I advised her the incident
               was just being documented. She stated she understood. A picture
               of her arm was taken and placed in Files. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               30th day of July, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.
