               certain parents on this issue. She did not provide me with

               Poss of Marijuana UFG NARRATIVE: On 07/26/15 at about 2209
               hours I observed a vehicle traveling southbound on Stadium Way
               near the Stadium. The vehicle had no lights on. I activated my
               emergency lights and the vehicle pulled over at the entrance to
               the Fine Arts parking garage. I approached the vehicle and
               spoke to the driver, Niaylah S. King(071897). As I began to
               talk to the driver the front passenger said he had a phone call
               and asked to exit the vehicle I said that was all right. As I
               continued to talk to the King I could smell an odor of
               marijuana coming from the vehicle. I asked her if the marijuana
               was the passengers who just left, she said it was. I asked how
               much marijuana was in the vehicle and King said "just a little
               bit". I asked her old she was she said 18. I asked her if she
               had a medical marijuana card she said she did not. I contacted
               Corporal Kuhrt on the radio and asked if he could attempt to
               find the passenger who had just walked away from the vehicle.
               King said she only knew the passenger first name, Demitri. She
               said she just met him at WSU Alive orientation. Corporal Kuhrt
               and Officer Petlovany searched the area and could not find
               Demitri, later identified as, Demitri L B Pence(032497). I
               asked King to hand me the marijuana the was in the vehicle. She
               removed a small purple plastic container and a glass pipe from
               the center console of the vehicle and handed it to me. The
               container had a small green bud and some green crumbs, that
               based on my training and experience was marijuana. The glass
               pipe also contained burnt marijuana. King stated she had not
               smoked any marijuana, that Pence was the only one who smoked
               and it was outside of her vehicle. She said the marijuana was
               Pence's but she knew he had it and knew it was in the vehicle.
               I told her I was going to let her go with a warning and that I
               would be forwarding my report to student conduct as well as
               notifying Alive staff of the incident. I cleared the traffic
               stop and went to the Stephenson complex to talk to Alive staff.
               Corporal Kuhrt and Officer Petlovany were there and had advise
               staff of the incident a found an Alive participant with the
               name of Demitri. I took down his information and explained the
               incident to staff. Officer Petlovany, an Alive staff member and
               I went to the twelve floor of Stephenson North where Pence was

               staying. Shortly after arriving on the twelfth floor I saw
               Pence, I asked him if he was Demitri and if I saw him earlier
               on the traffic stop. He said he was Demitri and was at the
               traffic stop. I asked if we could go into his room and talk. He
               said we could. I asked him if he knew why I was there. He said
               because he left, I said no. I asked him if he left anything
               behind. He said he may have left a water bottle. Then he said
               "are you trying to say I left weed in there". Pence continued
               to deny the marijuana was his. He also stated the marijuana was
               King's. I told him I was going to let him go with a warning and
               that I would be forwarding my report to student conduct as well
               as notifying Alive staff of the incident. I photographed and
               logged the container with marijuana and the glass pipe into
               evidence for destruction. King and Pence were warned for
               Possession of marijuana under forty grams. The case will be
               forwarded to student conduct and Alive staff was notified.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury

               is true and correct. Dated this 27th day of July, 2015, in

               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Kimara M. McCants 04/19/95 Booked Warrant 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 07/27/15 at approximately 0020 hours I was
               traveling south on NE Stadium Way from Cougar Way. I saw the
               defendant's vehicle traveling north towards my location. The
               vehicle appeared to be traveling very fast. I activated my
               radar (Veh 7) and it displayed a speed reading of 39MPH in a
               20MPH speed zone. I turned behind the vehicle and activated my
               emergency lights. I activated my VieVu camera. I contacted the
               driver and told her the reason for the stop and that it was
               being recorded. I asked for her license, registration, and
               proof of insurance. The driver provided me with her bill of
               sale paperwork from purchasing the vehicle and verbally
               identified herself as Kimara M. McCants 04/19/95. I returned to
               my patrol car and ran McCants' information on my MDC. McCants
               returned with a warrant from Clark County. I had Whitcom
               confirm the warrant. I noticed McCants vehicle had a temporary
               registration in the back window that appeared altered. The
               registration expired on 06/19 or 06/29 of 2015, either way it
               was expired. I issued McCants an infraction for the speed and
               registration. I explained the infraction to McCants and gave
               her a copy. I asked McCants if she didn't show up for court and
               she said that was correct. I explained that she had a warrant
               and asked her to exit her vehicle, which she did. I told
               McCants she was under arrest for the warrant. I handcuffed
               (D/L) McCants and advised her of her right to remain silent and
               her right to counsel. I reminded McCants I was recording. Ofc.
               Whitman arrived on scene and parked McCants' vehicle in the
               Episcopal Church lot per her request (leaving the keys in the
               ignition). I transported McCants to Whitman County Jail, read
               her the warrant, and turned her over to jail staff. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 27th day of July, 2015, in Pullman,
