               Operations was not answering telephone calls from Whitcom.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On July
               29, 2105 at about 0943 hours I was dispatched to a welfare
               check at WSU Facilities Operations dispatch center. Whitcom was
               trying to call Facilities Operations on the telephone and there
               was no answer. I responded to McCluskey Services. Facilities
               Operations dispatch personnel said there were no problems and
               that they did not receive any phone calls. It appeared to be
               business as usual in the building. There is construction
               happening outside of the building. It is unknown if the
               construction had anything to do with the telephone service.
               While I was there Whitcom called and was able to speak with the
               Facilities Operations dispatcher. There was no emergency. No
               further investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 29th day of July,
               2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               traffic offense happening in WSU and Pullman Police
               jurisdictions. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On July 29, 2015 at about 1354 hours I was
               dispatched to a traffic offense. The vehicle was northbound on
               Stadium Way at Grimes when the reporting party called Whitcom.
               Before I could respond the vehicle had already north on Stadium
               Way past Beasley Coliseum and eventually somewhere near
               McDonalds. The vehicle description and timing are similar to
               that of a traffic offense Pullman Police were dispatched to
               just a few minutes prior on SR 270/East Main Street. It is
               probable that this is the same vehicle. Pullman Police were
               advised of the vehicle location and they responded. No further
               investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 29th day of July, 2015, in

               an incident which occurred in Spokane County. Subject was
               referred to Spokane County. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 07-29-15 at approximately 1403
               hours, I was advised of a subject wanting phone contact
               reference an incident which occurred in Spokane. Whitcom was
               unable to get very much information from the subject and didn't
               understand he needed to report the incident where the incident
               occurred. I called the subject, Martin Swanson by phone. I had
               a hard time understanding Martin as he rambled. What I
               determined from our conversation was an incident involving a
               male and his mother occurred at his mother's home located in
               Spokane. He stated he wanted to report it as he was afraid the
               male would come find him. He stated he was currently at Spokane
               Community College, but was unable to provide his home address.
               I advised Martin I would be able to provide him with the phone
               number to contact Spokane County Sheriff's Department which is
               who I believed he would need to report the incident to. I
               explained how jurisdiction worked to him and he stated he
               understood. I provided him with the non-emergent phone number
               and we concluded the phone call. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 29th day of
