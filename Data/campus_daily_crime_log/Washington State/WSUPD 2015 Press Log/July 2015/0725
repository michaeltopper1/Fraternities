               15 I was dispatched to the report of a lockout at Abelson Hall
               room #406, located at 205 NE Library Rd. Dispatch advised
               complainant, Erika A. Serrano Romero (DOB 11-27-86), was locked
               out of her lab. I arrived on scene. I contacted Serrano Romero
               outside of room #406. She told me she thought she left her keys
               and wallet inside of the lab. I unlocked room #406 for her and
               she looked all around the room, but was unable to locate her
               keys and wallet. I asked her if she was anywhere else on campus
               yesterday where she may have left them. Serrano Romero told me
               she went to the CUB as well. I told Serrano Romero we could go
               check the CUB lost and found at the information desk. I
               provided Serrano Romero a courtesy transport to the CUB. We
               went to the information desk and she described her wallet and
               keys to the employee. The CUB employee was able to locate her
               items in the lost and found and returned them to her. I asked
               Serrano Romero to make sure nothing was taken from her wallet.
               She went through her wallet, and she told me everything was
               still there. I cleared the scene. No further action. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3194 SYNOPSIS: Report of a stove on fire
               at Steptoe Village Apartments. Officers arrived on scene and
               the fire was already out. Pullman Fire Department arrived on
               scene and investigated. WSU Housing Maintenance was later
               notified. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 07-25-15 at approximately 1151 hours I was toned out to a
               stove fire at Steptoe Village Apartments #V102, located at 1630
               NE Valley Rd. Dispatch advised the complainant, Wenxing Song
               (DOB 02-24-87), could see flames coming from her kitchen stove.
               I arrived on scene. I could not see any smoke or flames coming
               from the apartment building. I was contacted by Song and her
               roommate, Hong Zhang (DOB 07-09-89). They both told me their
               kitchen stove in their apartment had caught on fire. I asked if
               there was anyone else still in their apartment, and they said
               no. Song told me she thought the fire was out now because they
               dumped water on it. I could see the sliding glass door to their
               apartment was open on the ground floor from the deck area.
               There was a strong burnt odor, but I could not see any flames.
               I walked around to the front door of apartment #V102 and could
               not see any flames. I walked into the kitchen and the stove was
               burnt, but there was no fire or smoke. Pullman Fire Department
               soon arrived on scene. They shut off the electricity to the
               stove, and determined the scene was safe. They told Song and
               Zhang not to use the stove until it is replaced. The
               firefighters showed them how to use the fire extinguisher if
               they need to use it in the future. Song told me she was using
               the stove when the back left burner caught on fire. She said
               there was a lot of oil in the bottom of the burner. I took
               photographs of the damages to the burnt stove, and they were
               later uploaded into Spillman. Ofc. Olmstead later notified WSU
               Housing Maintenance. My Vievu camera was activated, and the
               video has been downloaded into the permanent digital evidence
               folder. We both cleared the scene. No further action. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3196 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched to a
               report of harassment at Holland Library. The complainant
               reported that a library patron was making her uncomfortable.
               The patron was contacted and warned. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 07-25-2015 at about 1220 hrs I
               was dispatched to a report of harassment at Holland Library,
               located at 1400 NE Terrell Mall. I contacted the complainant,
               Allyson J. Agustin (DOB 11-08-1994), on the telephone. Agustin
               told me that she is a library employee and was working at the
               library about one month ago. On that day, Agustin said she was
               approached by a male library patron who was "hitting" on her.
               Agustin explained that the male was asking for her telephone
               number and asked to meet her for a date. Agustin said she
               thought the situation was strange because the male was
               bothering her when she was working, and she did not know how to
               respond. Agustin said she was worried that if she responded
               negatively, it would be interpreted as bad customer service.
               Agustin indicated to the male that she was not interested in
               providing her telephone number or meeting with him. During the
               past few weeks, Agustin has observed the male in the library
               occasionally, but he has not spoken to her. While at work today
               at about 1200 hrs, Agustin saw the male in the library again.
               The male approached her and asked to meet with her when she was
               off work and asked to Facetime her. The male also asked her for
               assistance in entering the Graduate Student Lounge. Agustin
               assisted the male and told him she did not want to meet with
               him or provide him with her telephone number. The male asked
               Agustin why she seemed uncomfortable when speaking with him and
               then walked away. Agustin described the male as: black male;
               college age; 5-07; 150 lbs; long sleeved shirt; jeans. Agustin
               said the male was last observed in the Graduate Student Lounge.
               Agustin said the male was making her uncomfortable, and she did
               not want the male to bother her again. I told Agustin that I
               would contact the male and advise him to have no further
               contact with her. I responded to the library and contacted
               library management staff members, who were already aware of the
               situation. It was decided that I would warn the male patron to
               stay away from Agustin, and he would be allowed to remain in
               the library. I contacted the male patron in the Graduate
               Student Lounge, and he was identified as Olasunkanmi J. Kehinde
               (DOB 11-14-1984). I explained the situation to Kehinde and
               asked him what had happened. Kehinde denied asking Agustin out
               on a date or for her telephone number. Kehinde explained that

               he is a Christian and was simply attempting to have a
               conversation with her. Kehinde said he noticed that Agustin
               seemed uncomfortable when he was speaking with her, and he
               asked her what was wrong. Agustin told him she was busy.
               Kehinde said he asked Agustin for assistance with entering the
               Graduate Student Lounge and did not have any further contact
               with her. I explained to Kehinde that the best solution to this
               problem was for him to avoid Agustin and have no further
               contact with her. I told Kehinde to use other library employees
               if he needed assistance. Kehinde agreed to do this. I explained
               to Kehinde that if he bothered Agustin again, he would be
               trespassed from the library. Agustin and library management
               staff were directed to call the police department if they have
               any additional problems with Kehinde. No crime had occurred. I
               cleared the scene. No further action at this time. Olmstead/339

               subject had just put a spare tire on his vehicle. Officer
               escorted subject to tire shop so he could get his tire fixed.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 07-25-
               15 at approximately 1436 hours I was on patrol in the area of
               Terre View Drive and Chief Joseph Apartments. I saw a tan, 1996
               Toyota Corolla (ID Lic. #1LD6243) traveling at a very low rate
               of speed by the Cougar Ridge Apartments on Terre View. I pulled
               over to the side of the road to see if the driver needed
               assistance. The driver of the Toyota exited his vehicle and
               approached me. He later identified himself as Guillermo N.
               Pugliese (DOB 03-08-83). Pugliese told me he got a flat tire a
               few minutes ago. I asked him if he had a spare tire, and he
               told me did, and he already changed it. Pugliese told me he
               lives in Moscow, but he would like to get it fixed. He
               mentioned he could take it to Evergreen Tire/Affordable
               Advanced Autocare off of Stadium Way. I told Pugliese I would
               give them a call to see if they could assist him. I called
               Evergreen Tire and they told me they were open until 1700 hours
               today, and they had his size tire in stock. I told Pugliese I
               would follow behind him because he was not able to travel very
               fast. I followed him to Evergreen Tire. I cleared the scene. No
               further action. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 25th day of July, 2015, in
               Pullman, Washington. _______________________________________

               consuming marijuana 2. NARRATIVE: On 07/25/15 at approximately
               2230 hours Ofc. Whitman and I were on foot patrol in the grey
               lot of Stephenson. We were standing on the sidewalk watching a
               car back down the entryway. The vehicle turned around and
               pulled up next to me. I noticed the headlight of the vehicle
               was out. I activated my VieVu camera. The driver (and sole
               occupant) rolled down his window and asked how he was supposed
               to exit the lot because there was a do not enter sign. I told
               him he should follow the road to the right. I also told the
               driver he needed to fix his headlight. While standing at the
               car I could smell the odor of burning marijuana emitting from
               the vehicle and I could see smoke in my flashlight beam. I
               asked the driver if he was 21 and he said no. I asked the
               driver if he had a medical marijuana card and he said no. I
               asked how much marijuana was in the car and he said none. I
               explained to him that I could see smoke coming from his car, I
               could smell it, and his eyes were bloodshot and watery. I
               explained that he had clearly been smoking marijuana. The
               driver then told me that he had smoked marijuana about an hour
               ago in his car in the parking lot and pointed to the tier above
               us. I asked where the marijuana was and he said he only had a
               "vape pen" in his pocket. I asked if he would get it for me,
               which he did, and then handed it to me. I asked the driver for
               his ID, which he provided, identifying him as Bradley J. Stipek
               04/08/97. I asked Stipek on a scale of 1-10 how high he felt
               and he said a 4. Stipek agreed to perform field sobriety tests,
               but I did not feel he was impaired. I explained that even
               without impairment he could be arrested because he is under the
               age of 21. I had Stipek park his vehicle in the nearest parking
               stall. I warned Stipek for possession of marijuana and driving
               after consuming marijuana. I told Stipek to expect to meet with
               the ALIVE staff in the morning and that the case would be sent
               to student conduct. I told Stipek he was free to go. I went and
               spoke with the ALIVE staff and informed them of the contact. I
               returned to WSUPD and logged the "vape pen" (which contained
               marijuana wax) into evidence. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Victoria A. Corona 12/04/94 Cited DUI C09952 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 07/26/15 at approximately 0130 hours I was parked
               in the lot of Kamiak Apts near the I building monitoring
               traffic on NE Valley Rd. I saw the defendant's vehicle
               traveling westbound on NE Valley Rd. from the area of NE Merman
               Dr. I activated my handheld radar (Genesis) and it displayed a
               speed reading of 30MPH in a 25MPH speed zone. The vehicle
               continued westbound past my location and as it neared Brandi
               Dr. the speed increased to 33MPH. I caught up with the vehicle
               at the intersection of Stadium Way and activated my emergency
               lights. The vehicle turned left onto Harvey Dr. and continued
               for approximately 100 yards before coming to a stop. I
               activated my VieVu camera. I exited my patrol car and contacted
               the driver. I told the driver the stop was being recorded as
               well as the reason for the stop. I asked for her license,
               registration, and proof of insurance. The driver provided me
               with her license (identifying her as Victoria A. Corona
               12/04/94) and insurance. Corona continued to look for her
               registration. While standing at the car I could smell the odor
               of intoxicants emitting from the vehicle. I asked Corona where
               she was coming from and she said was going to pick up a friend.
               Corona eventually found her registration. I asked Corona how
               much she had to drink and she said none. I asked Corona if I
               could check her eyes and she said I could. I administered an
               HGN test with Corona sitting in the vehicle. I saw a lack of
               smooth pursuit and a distinct and sustained nystagmus at
               maximum deviation in both eyes. I noticed her eyes were
               bloodshot and watery. I returned to my patrol car and turned
               off my front facing emergency lights. I checked Corona on my
               MDC and she returned clear and current. I returned to Corona's
               vehicle and confirmed with her she had nothing to drink. I
               asked Corona if she provided a breath sample if it would show
               zero's and she said it would. I asked Corona if she would
               provide a breath sample on the PBT which she agreed to. I
               explained to Corona that the test was voluntary and did not
               replace the evidentiary breath test. I checked the PBT (FST
               #62324) and found it in proper working condition. Corona
               provided a very weak breath sample of .139 at 0139 hours. I
               told Corona the results. Corona asked if she could just go
               home. I asked Corona if she would perform some field sobriety
               tests to see if she was impaired by the alcohol she consumed

               and she said she would. Ofc. Whitman arrived on scene around
               this time. I directed Corona to the sidewalk on the south side
               of the roadway. I administered the tests on the level and paved
               sidewalk. Lighting was provided by overhead lights and my
               flashlight. The weather was clear with an approximate
               temperature of 65 degrees. Corona was wearing a tank top shirt,
               shorts, and flip flops during the tests. The first test I
               administered was the HGN. I told Corona to follow the tip of my
               pen with her eyes only with out moving her head. I held my pen
               approximately 12-15 inches in front of Corona's face and
               administered the test. I checked Corona's eyes and found that
               they tracked equally and her pupils were equal in size. I did
               not see resting nystagmus in either eye. I saw a lack of smooth
               pursuit and a distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum
               deviation in both eyes. I saw an onset of nystagmus at
               approximately 40 degrees in both eyes. Corona swayed in a
               circular motion during the test. The next test I administered
               was the walk and turn. I told Corona to find an imaginary
               straight line and put her left foot on the line. I told Corona
               to put her right foot in front of her left foot touching heel
               to toe and leave her arms down at her sides. I told Corona to
               stay in that position while I explained the test. I told Corona
               that when I tell her to begin, to take nine steps touching heel
               to toe, watching her feet as she walked and count each step out
               loud. I told Corona that when she gets to step nine, to leave
               her lead foot in place and using her rear foot, take small
               steps around until facing the way she came. I told Corona to
               take nine steps back touching heel to toe and counting each
               step out loud. I told Corona that once she started, do not
               stop. I reminded Corona to count each step out loud, keep her
               arms at her sides, and watch her feet as she walked. I
               demonstrated the test and asked Corona if she understood and
               she said yes. I told Corona to begin at any time. Starting
               position: While I was explaining the test, Corona lost her
               balance and stepped out of the starting position to the left
               with her left foot. Corona returned to the starting position,
               but she was not touching heel to toe. First Nine Steps: Corona
               began the test and missed heel to toe between steps 3 & 4.
               Corona stepped off the line to the left on step 9 and stopped
               walking. Corona performed an improper turn by spinning on both
               feet. Return Nine Steps: Corona began the return steps and
               stepped off line to the right on step 5 and stopped. Corona
               missed heel to toe between steps 5 & 6. The next test I
               administered was the one leg stand. I told Corona to stand with
               her feet together and her arms down at her sides. I told Corona
               that when I tell her to begin to raise the foot of her choice
               approximately 6 inches off the ground. I told Corona to point
               her toe forward, look at her foot, and count out loud by 1000's
               until I tell her to stop. I asked Corona if she understood, and
               she said yes. I told Corona to begin at any time. Corona raised
               her right foot and began the test. Corona raised her foot
               between 10-15 inches during the test. Corona pointed her toe up
               until her count of 1006. Corona put her foot down on her count
               of 1008 and then restarted counting from 1001. Corona swayed
               left to right during the test. 30 seconds elapsed on Corona's

               count of 1012. At this time it was my opinion that Corona's
               ability to drive was impaired by alcohol. I told Corona she was
               under arrest for DUI. I handcuffed (D/L) Corona and advised her
               of her right to counsel and reminded her she was being audio
               and video recorded. I placed Corona in the back seat of my
               patrol car. Ofc. Whitman facilitated the tow/impound with
               Meyer's Towing. I transported Corona to Pullman PD for the BAC.
               Upon arrival I checked the Dreager and found it working
               properly with the mouth tube warm to the touch. I read Corona
               her Constitutional Rights at 0205 hours. Corona said she
               understood her rights and signed both signature blocks. I
               checked Corona's mouth at 0205 hours, finding no foreign
               substance. I read Corona her Implied Consent Warning for Breath
               at 0210 hours. Corona read over it on her own as well. Corona
               signed that it was read to her. I asked Corona if she would
               submit to a breath test. Corona initially checked the "no" box,
               but then checked the "yes" box and circled it and initialed
               next to it. I asked Corona if she understood the implied
               consent and she said she did. Corona provided a breath sample
               of .192 IR/.192 EC at 0225 hours and as sample of .185 IR/.179
               EC. The breath test was administered in accordance to the
               methods approved by the Washington State Toxicologist pursuant
               to the Washington Administrative Code. I provided Corona with a
               copy of the following documents: Driver's Hearing Request,
               Notice of Hearing/Conditions of Release, Tow/Impound Form, and
               the Breath Test Document. I issued Corona a criminal citation
               for DUI. I explained the citation to her and provided her a
               copy. I released Corona from custody and provided her a
               courtesy transport home. Corona was polite and cooperative
               during my contact with her. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 26th day of July,
               2015, in Pullman, Washington.

    Time Occurred between: 05:16:22 07/26/15 - 05:16:22 07/26/15

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Whitman / 323 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #:15-W3208 SYNOPSIS: Responded to a fire alarm
               at Dana Hall. Fire alarm was set off by someone setting off a
               fire extinguisher on the basement floor. No suspects or leads
               at this time. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 07/26/15 at about 0516 hours Pullman Fire
               Department was dispatched to a fire alarm at Dana Hall. I
               responded to Dana Hall. When I arrived I saw no smoke or flames
               showing. I began to walk around the perimeter of the building.
               I looked in the door on the south side of Dana Hall which
               enters on the basement level. I could see what appeared to be
               smoke or dust in the hallway. I notified Pullman Fire as they
               were arriving and they investigated. They found no fire
               emergency. Corporal Kuhrt arrived on scene and met with
               Firefighters on the west side of Dana Hall at the loading dock.
               There was a fire extinguisher just inside the door there that
               had been set off. The contents of the extinguisher covered the
               floor and was still hanging in the air. I photographed the
               extinguisher and the area around it. Underneath the extinguish
               was a black hair tie with hair attached to it. The tie may have
               been used to keep the extinguisher handle depressed. I
               collected the hair tie. I checked the extinguisher for
               fingerprints. I could see no fingerprints, which should have
               been visible due to the dust created by the contents of the
               extinguisher. Corporal Kuhrt located where the extinguisher was
               taken from. The extinguisher was taken from the basement floor
               near the door on the south side of the building. I photographed
               the area where it was taken from. I later placed the hair tie
               in evidence. There was a similar incident on 07/10/15 at Daggy
               Hall see case #15-W3013. No suspects or leads at this time.
               Nothing further at this time. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 27th day of
               July, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Boyd/335 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3209 SYNOPSIS: Report of a subject
               experiencing breathing difficulty. Subject was transported to
               PRH via ambulance. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 07/26/15 at about 0534 hrs Dispatch toned out
               Pullman Ambulance to a report of a subject with breathing
               difficulty at Kamiak Apartment #D3. I responded and contacted
               the subject, James A. Ferguson (110380). Ferguson was able to
               speak with me and did not appear to be having difficulty
               breathing. Ferguson spoke with slurred speech but I could
               understand what he was saying. Ferguson tried to stand up twice
               and immediately began to fall over. I asked if the balance
               issues were normal for him and he said no. He told me he got
               off work at a bar and had about 36 oz of beer, which is normal
               for him. He also took one of his medications after returning
               home. As I was speaking with him I could tell his speech was
               becoming increasingly slurred. I gathered what medication
               bottles I could find around the living area of the apartment.
               Pullman fire arrived on scene and transported Ferguson to PRH
               for treatment. I secured his apartment and provided his
               Washington Driver's License, money clip with some cash and
               credit card, and keys to the fire department to take with
               Ferguson. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 26 day of July, 2015,
               in Pullman, Washington. _______________________________________
