               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3064 SYNOPSIS: Report of offensive
               statement written in black marker on a bathroom mirror in Sloan
               Hall. No suspects or leads at this time. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 07-15-15 at
               approximately 0857 hours I was dispatched to a report of
               malicious mischief in Sloan Hall, located at 405 NE Spokane St.
               Dispatch advised a custodian discovered writing on a bathroom
               mirror in the men's restroom on the 1st floor. I arrived on
               scene. I contacted the WSU Custodian, Sharon K. Stout (DOB 07-
               07-60), waiting outside the men's restroom for me. Stout told
               me a professor came by a few minutes ago while she was waiting
               for me to arrive and told her he saw something written on the
               mirror at about 0745 hours this morning that was really
               offensive. She told me that he had washed it off. I asked her
               what it said, and she was unsure but said he mentioned it was
               really hateful. Stout told me she went in to clean the restroom
               at about 0850 hours and saw some more writing on the mirror and
               that's when she called to report it. Stout told me Sloan was
               open to the public today at 0700 hours. I saw that someone had
               used a black marker to write the following statement on the
               mirror in the restroom: "Mohammed is a transexual" The men's
               restroom is located across the hall from room #175. I estimated
               the damage to be $25.00. I photographed the damage, and the
               photographs have been downloaded into Spillman and attached to
               this case. Stout told me she was going to clean off the mirror.
               I asked Stout if I could speak with the professor that noticed
               witting on the mirror in the morning. Stout told me the
               professor's name is William F. Cofer (DOB 02-20-54) and tried
               taking me to his office in Sloan, but he was not there. I later
               called Cofer on the phone. He told me he went into the restroom
               at about 0745 hours to wash out his coffee cup in the sink when
               he saw writing on the mirror with black marker. I asked Cofer
               what the writing said and he replied he did not remember
               exactly. He remembers it saying "Mohammed is gay" or something
               like that. Cofer mentioned he remembers the word "ass", but
               that is it. He told me he washed it off because he did not want
               others to see it and be offended. I asked Cofer if it happens
               again in the future to please take a picture of it on his phone
               before washing it off so we can have a photo for our report.
               Cofer told me he would. I notified WSU Facilities Operations.
               This case is similar to one Ofc. Olmstead had on 06-09-15 (see
               case #15-W2668 for full report). No suspects or leads at this
               time. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the

               left on the top of Terrell Library. There are no suspects or
               leads at this time. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 07-15-15 at approximately 1509 hours I was
               dispatched to the report of a stolen iPad that was left on the
               top of Terrell Library, located at 1400 NE Terrell Mall.
               Dispatch advised the complainant, Cesar R. Munguia (DOB 04-24-
               92), was down in the front lobby of the police department for
               contact. I met with Munguia in the front lobby, who was also
               with Alexa N. David (DOB 08-12-90). Both Munguia and David work
               for Washington State University New Student Programs. Munguia
               told me on 06-08-15 he was doing Orientation Counselor (OC)
               activities with the incoming freshmen. He said they were on top
               of Terrell Library where he last saw the black, 2011 Apple iPad
               2 16GB (serial #DMQJM852DFHW). Munguia told me the iPad
               belonged to WSU New Student Programs. He said he remembers
               putting the iPad on a ledge on the path near the flowers at
               about 1500 hours. He said he walked his group of students back
               to their dorm before he forgot leaving the iPad behind. Munguia
               returned to the top of Holland Library at about 1530 hours and
               the iPad was no longer there. I asked if he had any idea who
               may have taken it, and he said no. A black, 2011 Apple iPad 2
               16GB (serial #DMQJM852DFHW) was stolen from the top of the
               Terrell Library. The WSU Inventory Number 397622 is on the back
               of the iPad with a barcode. There is also a sticker on the back
               that says "Crimson 19". There was a crimson in color soft case
               on the iPad. There are no other distinguishing marks. The total
               estimated value is $540.00. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this ____ day of

               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On July 15, 2015 at about
               1916 hours WSU Police and Pullman Fire were dispatched to the
               Washington Building for a fire alarm. Officer Stewart and I
               responded to the building. Upon our arrival I could hear the
               water flow alarm sounding. The annunciator showed a water flow.
               Pullman Fire and WSU Police personnel checked the building for
               a water flow. We were unable to locate a water flow or any fire
               emergency. Pullman Fire personnel contacted WSU Life Safety. It
               was determined to be a water flow spike that activated the
               alarm. No fire emergency. I reset the burglary alarm and
               secured the building. No further investigation. I certify and

               Warned/Refer to Drugs (06/03/97) Student Standards NARRATIVE:
               On July 15, 2015 at about 2325 hours I was dispatched to the
               Stephenson Complex for the report of subjects smoking
               marijuana. The Stephenson Complex was occupied by new students
               attending the ALIVE orientation. I responded to the building
               where I contacted ALIVE staff in their office space in the main
               complex building. Evelyn M. Martinez (07/25/90), Alive
               Coordinator, told me two (2) male ALIVE students were caught by
               her staff smoking marijuana outside of Stephenson East. There
               were two (2) males sitting at a table in the office. I could
               smell the odor of burnt marijuana. Both of them had red,
               bloodshot eyes. The males were later identified as SCOTT,
               Carson J. (01/16/97) and MEITL, Beau L. (06/03/97). I asked
               Scott and Meitl to tell me what happened and why am I here.
               Meitl said they were smoking "weed" outside of the Stephenson
               Building. He went on to tell me they then went inside
               Stephenson East and up the elevator. Meitl said they had been
               smoking a "joint" and there was nothing left of it. Scott told
               me Meitl's account of the incident was accurate. I read both
               Meitl and Scott their constitutional rights which they
               individually acknowledged and waived. They both claimed
               ownership of the joint. They both claim there was no more
               marijuana in their possession or in their rooms. I asked them
               how often they smoke marijuana. Scott told me about once a
               week. He then proceeded to tell me how "casual" it is in
               Seattle to smoke marijuana. I counseled and educated both males
               on marijuana, alcohol, and the laws pertaining to each. They
               both appeared to be remorseful. They were engaged and appeared
               to be having an honest conversation with me. I advised both of
               them that there would be no criminal charges or arrest. They
               will be referred to WSU Student Standards and Accountability.
               No further investigation. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 16th day of July,
               2015, in Pullman, Washington.
