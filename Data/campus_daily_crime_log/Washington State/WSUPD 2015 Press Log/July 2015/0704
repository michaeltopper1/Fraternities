               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2957 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched to a
               burglary alarm at the Student Recreation Center. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 07-04-2015 at
               about 1201 hrs I was dispatched to a burglary alarm at the
               Student Recreation Center (SRC), located at 1105 NE North
               Fairway Road. Officer Welter and I arrived on scene, and I
               contacted an individual walking away from the main entrance,
               who was identified as Carsten Volkner (DOB 10-12-1993). Volkner
               stated he had entered the SRC through an open door, which he
               described as being the farthest door to your left as you
               approach the main entrance. Once he was inside, Volkner said he
               realized the SRC was closed, and he exited the building.
               Officer Welter and I checked the door and determined that the
               air pressure inside the building would not allow the door to
               latch without purposefully pulling the door shut. We determined
               that the SRC was closed, the interior was unoccupied, and
               nothing appeared to be out of the ordinary. We speculated that
               the door had been accidentally left unlatched by staff members
               closing the facility last night. I reset the alarm, secured the
               front doors, and Officer Welter and I cleared the scene. SRC
               management was advised of the problem with the door. No further
               action at this time. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this __04__ day
               of ____July___, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: BRW/325 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2959 SYNOPSIS: Subject called in stating
               he was trying to kill himself. Subject was located and taken
               into protective custody. This case will be referred to WSU
               Counseling Services. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               Derek Z. Thompson 12/06/94 Protective Custody Suicide Attempt
               2. NARRATIVE: On 07/04/15 at approximately 2135 hours, Cpl.
               Kuhrt and I responded to the report of a male attempting
               suicide near Waller Hall. While en route to the call dispatch
               stated the male caller said he was inside a small white car in
               the parking lot between Stimson Hall and Waller Hall. Cpl.
               Kuhrt located the car in the parking lot south of Stimson. As I
               arrived I saw a male, later identified as Derek Zachary
               Thompson 12/06/94, leaned back in the driver's seat. I
               contacted Thompson at the driver's window as Cpl. Kuhrt went to
               the passenger side. Cpl. Kuhrt was able to talk to Thompson and
               get him to open the driver door. As Thompson opened the door I
               felt the air from within the car escape. The air from the car
               was very warm as if Thompson had been sitting inside the car
               for a long period of time with the windows rolled up. When
               Thompson opened the door I saw Thompson had superficial cuts to
               his left wrist. There was no visible blood from the cuts as
               they did not look deep at all. I also noticed quite a few
               hesitation marks on his wrist. I asked Thompson what was going
               on and all he would say was that he did not want to be here
               anymore. I interpreted his statement as him saying he did not
               want to live anymore. Thompson appeared to be lethargic and was
               sweating heavily. I noticed a prescription pill bottle in the
               center console that was missing its lid. I asked if Thompson
               had taken any and he said he did. Thompson said he did not know
               how many pills he took. I asked Thompson to hand me the bottle
               and he did. Inside the bottle I found an assortment of pills
               and had no way of knowing what different kind of pills he took.
               About this time Medics arrived and evaluated Thompson. As
               Medics were checking on Thompson I let the medics know that
               Thompson was in protective custody. The medics asked if
               Thompson wanted to go to the hospital voluntarily and he said
               he did. Thompson was taken to the hospital via ambulance. I
               also responded to the hospital and filled out the Protective
               Custody Paperwork. The paperwork was signed by Doctor Clark. A
               copy of the paperwork was later added to the files folder. Once
               the paperwork was completed I cleared the hospital. This case
               will be referred to WSU Counseling Services. END OF REPORT I
