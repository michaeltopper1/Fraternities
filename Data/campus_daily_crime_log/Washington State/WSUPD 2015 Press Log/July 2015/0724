    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Olmstead/339 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3182 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched to a
               report of an animal problem. The complainant reported that a
               dog was behaving aggressively. The owner of the dog was
               contacted and warned. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               2. NARRATIVE: On 07-24-2015 at about 1127 hrs I was dispatched
               to a report of an animal problem on the east side of Eastlick
               Hall, located at 300 NE Veterans Way. I arrived on scene and
               contacted the complainant, Wade L. Lafferty (DOB 02-22-1970).
               Lafferty directed me to a blue, 1992 Chevrolet Van (ID Lic.
               N161832), which was parked in a nearby disabled parking space.
               Lafferty told me that one dog was still in the vehicle, but
               another dog was outside the vehicle and was acting aggressively
               towards people when they walked past. Lafferty said the dog had
               been barking at people and charged towards someone. I observed
               a dog laying on the ground near the van and saw that the door
               to the van was propped open. The dog was not on a leash. I
               watched the dog bark at people in the area, but it remained in
               close proximity to the van. I determined that the registered
               owner of the vehicle was Robin L. House (DOB 04-27-1968). I
               contacted House on the telephone, and she arrived on scene.
               House explained that her dog should have been inside her
               vehicle and must have jumped out through the open door. I
               counseled House about her dog's aggressive behavior and
               educated her on the requirements for the control of dogs as per
               WAC for the WSU Campus and Pullman City Code. I told House that
               if her dog was found "at large" again, she would receive an
               infraction. House said she understood and assured me this would
               not happen again. House placed her dog back into her vehicle
               and drove away. I cleared the scene. No further action at this
               time. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this __24__ day of
               ___July____, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               has a scratch in it as well. $250.00 WITNESS(ES): None
               NARRATIVE: On 07-24-15 at approximately 1205 hours I was
               dispatched to the report of a two (2) vehicle non-injury
               collision in the yellow parking lot near Bailey Brayton Field.
               I responded to the area. I contacted the complainant, Mindy M.
               Hayes (DOB 03-22-75), in the northeast corner of the parking
               lot. She was standing by a gold 2002, Lexus ES300 (WA Lic.
               #ADK3790). I could see the left center of the trunk was dented
               and damaged. The top left center of the rear bumper was
               scrapped and scratched. The estimated damage to the Lexus is
               $400.00. I asked where the truck was and she pointed over to a
               silver, 2015 Toyota Tacoma (WA Lic. C93944B). I asked Hayes if
               anyone was injured, and she said no. The driver of the Toyota
               walked over and identified himself as Darren K. Solt (DOB 03-
               07-64). I asked Hayes and Solt for their driver's license,
               registration, and proof of insurance. They both provided me
               with all of these. However, the most current proof of insurance
               card Solt had on him expired 04-09-15, but he told me it was
               current he just did not have the card. Hayes' front end of her
               vehicle was facing south in another row in the parking lot and
               Solt's front end of his vehicle was facing north in another
               row. Solt told me he began to back out with the rear end of his
               Toyota facing east, but saw another vehicle coming. He said he
               waited for the car and kept going back and that's when him and
               Hayes collided. Hayes told me she noticed the same vehicle Solt
               saw and she began to slowly creep out and wait for the car to
               go by. Hayes rear end of her Lexus was beginning to face west.
               Neither Hayes or Solt mentioned seeing each others vehicles
               backing up. I asked them if they collided with each other at
               the same time. Solt replied "I guess". Hayes mentioned she

               heard it and was unsure of what happened until she turned back
               and saw it. Hayes said "I didn't see anything coming back at
               all". I looked at Solt's Toyota and the left side of his rear
               bumper had a few scratches. The left rear taillight had a
               scratch on it as well. The estimated total damage of the Toyota
               is $250.00. Hayes said she was almost idling when she was
               backing. I asked how far Hayes vehicle was into the aisle
               before the collision occurred. She told me she was at least
               halfway and blocking the whole aisle. Solt told me he was at
               least three quarters of the way back. I took photographs of the
               damages on both vehicles, and I later uploaded them into
               Spillman. Both Hayes and Solt said they were wearing their
               seatbelts, and neither of their airbags were deployed. I
               exchanged information between Hayes and Solt. No infractions
               were issued. My Vievu camera was activated, and the video has
               been downloaded into the permanent digital evidence folder. I
               cleared the scene. No further action. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
