    Narrative: RVWD: dd/329 OFC: ENW/328 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2986 SYNOPSIS: Reported theft of a
               remote access point sometime between 07/04/15 and 07/06/15 from
               outside of room 110 of Dana Hall. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 07/07/15 around 0841 hrs I was
               dispatched to a reported theft from in front of room 110 of
               Dana Hall. I contacted the reporting party, later identified as
               Damon D Estes (10/16/66), and was told the following. Estes
               explained a Cisco remote access point which had been installed
               near room 110 of Dana Hall had been reported to have gone
               offline around 0730 hrs on 07/07/15. He went on to tell me when
               the physical unit was checked it was found to be missing, along
               with the mounting bracket. I asked Estes when the last time he
               was aware of the unit being online and he told me his office
               had not received any reports leading into the holiday weekend,
               so he was certain it was still active up to 2300 hrs on
               07/04/15. When asked about the unit it was described as a Cisco
               brand, model number: 2702-I LAP, with a serial number of
               FCW1903N4W8, and a value of $700.00. When asked about the items
               Estes explained it would be virtually worthless to someone
               outside of the WSU Network for use, and added if it were
               plugged back into the network it would show up on their system.
               I told him if that occurs to give me a call along with the
               location and we would try and retrieve it. In addition I gave
               him the case number for reference and explained I would enter
               the item as a stolen article in the event someone else came
               across it. Estes thanked me and we concluded our call. I later
               completed the necessary paperwork to have the items entered as
               a stolen article and gave the information to WSUPD Records to
               be entered before clearing. No suspect and no leads at this
               time. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the
               laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 7th day of July, 2015, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer
