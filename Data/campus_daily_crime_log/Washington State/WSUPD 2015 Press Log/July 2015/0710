               issued a citation for open container. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE

               5Z0741555 2. NARRATIVE: On 07/10/15 at approximately 2236 hours
               I was driving northbound on Valley Road near the intersection
               of Valley and Merman Drive. I noticed a large group of people
               on the eastside sidewalk walking southbound towards me. On the
               opposite sidewalk was a single male walking southbound along
               the Valley Playfields. The male, later identified as Joshua
               Gunnar Benson 02/18/94, was carrying a silver aluminum can in
               his right hand. As I neared Benson he appeared to recognize my
               patrol car and threw the can into the grass next to him. I
               stopped my patrol car to talk to Benson about him littering his
               can. I told Benson to go pick up his can and he walked back to
               it and grabbed it. I saw the can was a Coors Light beer can
               that was open. Benson handed me the can without prompt. The can
               was cold to the touch and was about half full. I asked Benson
               how old he was and he said he was 21 years old. Benson provided
               me with his Washington Driver's license. I told Benson that
               because he threw his beer in the grass and tried to walk away
               from it I was going to be issuing him an open container
               citation. As I filled out Benson's citation, Benson said he had
               just come from a house up the street and was only walking about
               a block. Benson also stated his friends told him if he saw a
               cop to just throw the can to the ground. I issued Benson a
               Sector citation for PCC 5.55.010 possession of an open alcohol
               container. I explained the citation to Benson and provided him
               with his copy. Benson poured out the remaining beer and threw
               the can away in a nearby recycling bin. Benson was told he was
               free to go and I cleared. END OF REPORT I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               11th day of July, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Nolan James Wool 02/07/97 Charges Forwarded MIP
               Exhibiting 2. NARRATIVE: On 07/10/15 at approximately 2356
               hours I was standing in a tree line just north of Regents Hall.
               There had been a large party on Duncan Lane that Pullman Police
               Department was attempting to break up. While watching people
               leave the area I noticed two males walk up the stairs from
               Duncan Lane and head towards Regents. I watched as the two
               males stopped walking and turn towards the wall of the Regents
               Building. Believing the two had stopped to urinate I walked
               towards them. I turned my flashlight on and saw one of the
               males, later identified as Nolan James Wool 02/07/97, urinating
               into the bushes. I could see a steady stream of urine coming
               from Wool's crotch area. The second male was about to pee when
               I turned on my flashlight but did not have his pants undone
               yet. I told Wool to zip it up and Wool finished urinating. The
               second male was not identified. I told Wool to grab his ID for
               me. Wool provided his Washington Driver's License. Wool's WADL
               identified him as 18 years old. I noticed Wool's eyes appeared
               glassy and watery. Due to Wool coming from the area of the
               party and his decision to urinate in public I asked Wool how
               much he had to drink tonight. Wool said, "not much actually." I
               asked Wool how much that was for him and Wool said, "a beer or
               two." I asked Wool if I could look at his eyes and he said I
               could. I instructed Wool to stand with his heels and toes
               together and with his arms at his sides. I told Wool to follow
               the tip of my pen with his eyes only while keeping his head
               still. Wool stated he understood. During the HGN test I
               observed, equal pupil size, equal tracking, lack of smooth
               pursuit, and distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum
               deviation in both eyes. During the test Wool was swaying in all
               directions. As Wool stood before me I could clearly smell the
               odor of intoxicants coming from his breath. I asked Wool if he
               was willing to take a voluntary portable breath sample and Wool
               said he would like to talk to his parents. I asked Wool why he
               wanted to talk to his parents since he was an adult. Wool said
               because he can if he wants to. I told Wool that he was under
               arrest for MIP exhibiting and handcuffed (D/L) him. I advised
               Wool that he was being audio and video recorded and read him
               his Miranda Rights off my department issued card. Wool said he
               understood his rights and wished to talk to a lawyer before any

               questioning. I told Wool that I had no further questions so I
               would not be providing him with a lawyer. I walked Wool over to
               my patrol car and searched him incident to arrest. I found no
               weapons or illegal items. I placed Wool in the backseat of my
               patrol car while I researched his name. I ran Wool through
               dispatch who stated he had not been contacted by Law
               Enforcement in our area. I ran Wool's criminal history and
               found no entries. I told Wool that I would be forwarding
               charges of MIP exhibiting to the prosecutor and they would be
               in touch with him. I also explained the student conduct side of
               things. Wool asked for my contact information and vehicle
               information. I provided Wool with my business card that
               contained all my contact information and wrote down my badge
               number and vehicle number on the back for him. I also provided
               Wool with the phone number to Whitman County District Court so
               he could update his address with the court. I released Wool
               from custody and told him he was free to go. Wool asked if he
               could ask a question and I said sure. Wool asked if he took the
               PBT what would happen. I told Wool that regardless if he did
               the PBT or not I was going to forward charges to the
               prosecutor. Wool decided he still did not want to take the PBT.
