               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3162 SYNOPSIS: Report of pigeons flying
               around the fourth floor of the Biotech Life Sciences Building.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 07-23-
               15 at approximately 0820 hours I was dispatched to the report
               of an animal problem at the Biotech Life Sciences Building,
               located at 1715 NE Ferdinands Lane. Dispatch advised WSU
               Facilities Operations received a call from a complainant
               stating there are live birds flying all over the fourth floor
               of the building. I arrived on scene. I saw a door on the south
               side of the building propped open leading to a patio area.
               There were also small pieces of what appeared to be scrambled
               eggs and chicken leading up to the door. However, I did not see
               any birds in the area. I crossed the breezeway connecting the
               Biotech Life Sciences Building to the Veterinary Medical
               Research Building next door to see if I could find any birds. I
               spoke to an employee who said he has not seen any birds in the
               building, but he would call if he noticed any. I walked back to
               Biotech Life Sciences and continued to walk around until I saw
               Susan C. Wang (DOB 04-14-76) in her office. I asked Wang if
               they were having any bird problems in the building that she was
               aware of, and she said no. Wang said they have a lot of pigeons
               outside of the building, but has never seen them inside. I
               showed Wang the propped open door where I think someone was
               trying to release the birds. Wang was able to spot a pigeon
               sitting high up on the rafters nearby the propped open door.
               Wang told me her friend at WSU specializes in exotic birds, and
               she would ask her if she has any suggestions or traps to get it
               out of the building. Wang told me she would email me later once
               she heard back from her. I shut the door that was propped open
               so more birds would not fly in. I cleared the scene. I later
               received an email from Wang. She said her friend, Dr. Finch,
               has a big net so they are going to try and catch it later this
               morning. No further action at this time. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               23rd day of July, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               Officer returned the key to WSU Housing Services. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 07-23-15 at
               approximately 1110 hours I was advised there was a female
               waiting in the front lobby of the police department wanting to
               turn in a key. I went down to the front lobby and I contacted
               the female later identified as Vanessa M. Slape (DOB 02-03-92).
               Slape handed me a bronze in color key that she said belonged to
               her ex-roommate Karissa R. Montgomery (DOB 01-24-95). She told
               me the key was for an apartment at Terrace. Slape said
               Montgomery filed a police report saying she left with the key
               and would not return it. I asked Slape if she has the case
               number, but she said no. She also said she did not remember the
               officer she spoke with. Slape told me she was upset and may
               have been a little rude to the officer. I later looked up the
               case number and it was Ofc. Jones that spoke with her before.
               See case #15-W1771 for Ofc. Jones full report. Later that day I
               returned the key to WSU Housing. I cleared the scene. No

               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing

               NARRATIVE: On 07-23-15 at approximately 1125 hours, I contacted
               Texas Robinson at the Financial Aid Office in Lighty. She
               stated she had received a very strange email with the subject
               heading "I am brandon lee west.i have proof of a terrorist
               attack in spokane washington U.S.A and need your help
               DESPERATELY!!!i am the vicitm. Texas stated the email shows it
               has been sent to various departments and people. She provided
               me with a printed copy as well as an email copy of the letter
               which I later attached in Files. The letter is long rambling
               from a male, Brandon Lee West/11-24-90 out of Spokane. It
               appears West suffers from mental illness and believes he has
               been the victim of several crimes and is being followed. The
               letter rambles for several pages, is very hard to follow, and
               by the descriptions given it appears he may also be homeless.
               The letter appears to have been sent to the FBI, KXLY, Krem, LA
               Police, King County Sheriff's, and various other individuals
               and places. I did a search for West in local files and it shows
               he was arrested in 2009 by Pullman Police. There is nothing
               indicating he is in the area or is a student at WSU. A copy of
               the email will be sent to JTTF. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 23rd day of
               July, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               was dispatched to the report of a two (2) vehicle non-injury
               collision in the green parking lot off of Grimes Way near
               Bustad Hall. Subject was unaware where the other driver was,
               but thought she knew the vehicle that hit her parked vehicle.
               Officer was able to locate other driver and exchanged
               information between both driver's. There were no injuries.

               approximately 1214 hours I was dispatched to the green parking
               lot off of Grimes Way near Bustad Hall, for a two (2) vehicle
               non-injury collision. Dispatch advised the complainant was
               unsure where the driver of the other vehicle was, but her
               parked car had been hit. I responded to the area and contacted
               the complainant, Jennifer R. Babcock (DOB 01-04-87). Babcock
               showed me her gray, 2011 Nissan Altima (WA Lic. #AJR7142)
               parked in the northwest corner of the parking lot and four (4)
               rows down. Her vehicle had scratches and scrapes on the left
               rear quarter panel and what appeared to be blue paint transfer.
               She told me she parked her vehicle at about 0655 hours this
               morning and left to go to Jiffy Lube at about 1130 hours.
               Babcock said she noticed the damages on her vehicle when she
               was leaving Jiffy Lube at about 1200 hours, but knew she had
               not hit anything. The estimated value of the damage to the
               Nissan is $250.00. Babcock returned the green parking lot off
               of Grimes Way near Bustad Hall, and parked one spot over to the
               right from where she had originally parked this morning. That
               is when she called to report the damage to her vehicle. She
               showed me a blue, 2007 Chevrolet Impala (WA Lic. #AAJ3136) that
               had been parked next to her when she left for Jiffy Lube.
               Babcock showed me the front right side of the Chevrolet's
               bumper which had some scratches and scrapes that matched the
               damage on her vehicle. The damage appeared to be the same
               height as well. The estimated value of the damage to the
               Chevrolet is $250.00. Babcock told me the Chevrolet was not
               there this morning when she parked, but she usually sees it
               parked there when she leaves. She told me a female drives the

               vehicle, and she thinks she works in Bustad Hall because she
               normally sees her go out to the vehicle at about 1600 hours. I
               had Dispatch run the Chevrolet Impala (WA Lic. #AAJ3136) for
               any local phone numbers. It returned to a Douglas Libby and
               they said there was a contact number for a Julia Libby that
               works on the WSU Campus. I asked Dispatch to call her and have
               her come to her vehicle in the parking lot. Dispatch advised
               they spoke to Julia and they said she would be right down. A
               few minutes later a female come to the parking lot and
               identified herself as Julia E. Libby (DOB 03-30-69) by her WA
               Driver's License. I explained to Libby how Babcock had damage
               on her vehicle and that her car was parked next to hers this
               morning. Libby said "I thought I ran over something, I didn't
               think I hit the car". Libby apologized to Babcock. I asked
               Libby if she was injured at all, and she said no. Libby
               provided me with her current registration and proof of
               insurance. I took photographs of the damages on both vehicles,
               and I later uploaded them into Spillman. I asked Libby if she
               was wearing her seatbelt, and she said yes. Libby's airbag did
               not deploy. I asked Libby what time she parked the vehicle and
               collided with Babcock's Chevrolet. Libby said at approximately
               0715 hours is when it happened. I exchanged information between
               Babcock and Libby. My Vievu camera was activated, and the video

               found the northwest door locked and secure. The northeast door
               was unlocked. We made entry into the greenhouse and was soon
               contacted by a male who entered through the northeast door. The
               male said he works in the greenhouse and left to use the
               restroom. He thinks he accidentally activated the alarm. His
               photo was on the door and he had the code to reset the alarm.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3172 SYNOPSIS: Report of a citizen
               dispute on Old Wawawai Rd near Sunnyside Park. Determined to be
               a verbal domestic dispute, no crimes occurred. PPD requested an
               AOA. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               07-23-15 at about 1844 hours PPD units were dispatched to a
               citizen dispute on Old Wawawai Rd near Sunnyside Park. All PPD
               units were handling another call and asked for assistance from
               WSU. Officer Jones and I responded to the area. Whitcom advised
               that there was a male walking on Old Wawawai Rd that was in the
               roadway yelling at passing cars and kicking them as they slowed
               down. While en route, Whitcom advised that a car was now
               stopped and 2 males were arguing. As I approached the area I
               could see a male standing on the side of the road talking
               through the passenger side window of a car that was stopped. As
               I got closer the car, with a female driver, drove away. I
               pulled to the side of the road in front of the male and asked
               if I could talk to him. He was wearing a cycling outfit but I
               did not see a bike nearby. I asked him if he knew why I was
               there and he said probably because of the fight he had with his
               girlfriend. He said that he was out for a bike ride and was
               supposed to meet his girlfriend at Sunnyside Park but that he
               was late. He said this upset her and they started to argue.
               When the arguing began they were both in the car and his
               girlfriend told him to get out, so he did. The male, identified
               as Rhodri L. Smith, stated he was visiting his girlfriend,
               Sherry A. Craft, from the UK. He said there was no physical
               altercation and he was walking to "cool off". I asked him about
               yelling and kicking passing cars. He kind of laughed and said
               he did not do anything like that. While I was talking to Smith,
               the car that I had seen pulled over earlier was back and Smith
               identified the driver as his girlfriend. Officer Jones spoke to
               Craft. I asked Smith about his relationship with Craft and he
               said they have dated for 2.5 years and that they sometimes
               argue but they always work it out. I confirmed with Jones what
               Smith had told me and he said that Craft had a similar version
               of events. Craft allowed Smith to get back in her car. Neither
               seemed very upset while we were with them and both stated that
               they felt embarrased that we were called. No crimes occurred.
               After returning to the station to download my VieVu video I
               discovered that although I had turned my camera on, the battery
               was dead and it did not record the incident. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               at the Steptoe Village garden area. No criminal activity.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On July
               23, 2015 at about 1935 hours WSU Police were toned out to a
               citizen dispute at the Steptoe Village garden area. The dispute
               was about a male who was washing his car with the garden hose
               and water. Cpl. Edwards and I responded to the area. I
               contacted the complainant Narayan C. Paul (10/15/79). He told
               me that he was gardening when a male later identified as
               Abdulrazag M. Etelawi (06/21/73) asked him to turn off the
               hose. Etelawi was using the hose to wash his car in the parking
               lot. Paul told me that the hose and water is only for garden
               use. According to Paul the apartment coordinators have told
               tenants not to wash their cars with the garden hose. Paul and
               Etelawi do not know each other. Paul became offended when he
               heard Etelawi tell him that he will pay him money to do his
               work. Etelawi wanted Paul to shut off the water. The water shut
               off is located in the middle of the fenced in garden area. Paul
               was inside the garden in proximity to the water shut off. Cpl.
               Edwards contacted Etelawi. He just wanted Paul to shut the
               water off as Paul was close to the shut off. Etelawi told me
               that he asked Paul several times to shut it off and Paul didn't
               respond. Etelawi shut off the water and then asked Paul why he
               was acting that way. Etelawi told him it doesn't cost him
               (Paul) any money to shut off the water. There was no physical
               altercation between the men just a verbal dispute. I believe
               there was most likely a misunderstanding of what was actually
               said. No citations or charges to be forwarded. There was no
               crime that occurred, no further investigation. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               advised of a complaint regarding noisy children running around
               and yelling in apartment 657 at Yakama Village. Officer Whitman
               and I responded. Upon our arrival I spoke to the complainant,
               John W. Elzey, who told me there was a lot of yelling coming
               from some children in apartment 629. He was not sure if any
               adults were present. He said this has been an ongoing issue.
               from the turn around in front of apartment 629 I could hear
               what sounded like cartoons on a television and children
               laughing/running. As I approached apartment 629 the noise
               became louder. I knocked on the door and contacted the
               resident, Reem N. Aljuaidi (021988), and told her we received a
               noise complaint regarding the children being loud and the
               television. She apologized for the noise and asked who
               complained, because all of her neighbors were gone and she was
               watching their children. I could see approximately 8 children
               inside between the ages of 2 and 6. I told her it was someone
               from another building in the area. I explained to her the noise
               ordinance in Pullman and she said she would try to keep the
               noise down. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 24 day of
