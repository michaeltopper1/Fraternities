    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: DBT/321 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3276 SYNOPSIS: Subject reporting two
               dogs left unattended in hot parked vehicle near Abelson Hall.
               The complainant reported the dogs appeared distressed. Officers
               responded, and the owner of the dogs was contacted and warned.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 07-31-
               15 at approximately 1316 hours I was dispatched to a report of
               an animal problem on the north side of Abelson Hall, located at
               205 NE Library Rd. Dispatch advised the complainant saw two
               dogs inside a parked vehicle and they appeared to be
               distressed. Dispatch also said the dogs were trying to get out
               of the small crack in the window of the vehicle. Ofc. Olmstead
               contacted me on the radio, and he said he dealt with a similar
               animal problem with the same vehicle about a week ago (see case
               #15-W3182 for full report). I arrived on scene and contacted
               the complainant, Miguel A. Delamora (DOB 04-17-85). Delamora
               told me he arrived to work at Abelson Hall, when he saw the
               blue, 1992 Chevrolet Van (ID Lic. #N161832), which was parked
               in a nearby disabled parking space. He told me there were two
               dogs in the vehicle that were panting, and that he saw them
               trying to climb out of the partially open window of the
               vehicle. He said he arrived at Abelson Hall approximately 45
               minutes ago and the van had already been parked there, and the
               owner was not around. Ofc. Olmstead told me the registered
               owner of the vehicle was Robin L. House (DOB 04-27-68). I tried
               calling house on the phone, but her voicemail box was not set
               up. I sent House a text message telling her who I was, and that
               she needed to come out to her vehicle. She replied back that
               she would be there in a half an hour. I texted House back
               saying she needed to come to her vehicle now. Ofc. Olmstead
               arrived on scene. House came out to her vehicle a couple
               minutes later. The approximate temperature was 98 degrees
               Fahrenheit at the time. I told House the reason we were there,
               and that it is way too hot to be leaving her dogs unattended in
               her vehicle. House said she was attending a lecture that lasted
               longer than she had expected. She said she is traveling to
               Lewiston and that is the only reason she brought the dogs with
               her. House said she left plenty of water in the vehicle and
               left the windows open. I explained to House even though she
               left water and the windows open, the dogs should not be left
               like this in this hot of weather. House told us she understood
               and this would not happen again. House took both her dogs out
               of the vehicle and poured water over both of them. She then
               placed them both in the vehicle and drove away. Ofc. Olmstead

               hand by a dog at the SRC. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR#
               1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 073115 at approximately 1608 hours we were
               dispatched to a dog bite at the courts behind the Student
               Recreation Center (SRC). Cpl. Edwards and I responded. Upon
               arrival Cpl. Edwards met with the dog bite victim, Andrew R.
               Torres (061095), and I went to where the dog was. I wet with
               the owner of dog, Dustin L. Cooper (052388). He said his dog,
               Xavier, had been lying in the shade of a bench when a ball
               bounced his way. The approaching of Torres may have startled
               the dog. As Torres reached for the ball, the dog bit Torres on
               the left hand. The dog was reportedly on a leash held by
               Stephanie J. Parr (110189). The leash did not appear to be
               exceedingly long. Cooper told me Xavier was approximately 85
               lbs and would turn 4 years in September. He also told me that
               Xavier had recently bit another person (see related WSU case).
               The dog did not appear to be injured in the exchange. The
               outside temperature was approximately 100 F and could have been
               hotter near the courts. Torres sustained a possible puncture
               and lacerating wound to his left hand on the outside portion of
               his hand. Medics transported him to PRH. Photos were taken of
               the dog and the hand of Torres. Code Enforcement Officers
               Schaeffer and Johns arrived and I explained to them what had
               happened and told them about the previous event. They said they
               would follow up with both Torres and Cooper, particularly in
               regards to whether or not the dog would be declared a dangerous
               dog and if an infraction was to be issued. They would also take
               Torres his basketball that was left behind. The dog was
               licensed with Pullman under number 006556 and was most likely
               current on his shots. We cleared. Nothing follows. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.
               Dated this 31st day of July, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3279 SYNOPSIS: Report that network cable
               had been cut, disrupting network service to the computer lab in
               Wegner G70. Under investigation. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 07-30-15 at about 1642 hours I
               was dispatched to the report of a suspicious circumstance.
               Whitcom advised that Burton "Billy" D. Schmuck had called to
               report that the network cables in the computer lab located in
               Wegner Hall room G70 had been cut. Schmuck was requesting
               contact in Wegner G70. I contacted Schmuck and Timothy R.
               Munson. Munson stated that he works as a timeslip employee for
               IT in Wegner Hall. He said he got an email from a student on
               07-30-15 at 1107 hours advising that the network in G70 was
               down. The problem was not immediately resolved and it was
               discovered that the network cables in the room had been cut.
               Schmuck showed me where the network cables come into the lab
               and said that is where they had been cut. I could see 3 white
               cables that appeared to be cut and a blue Ethernet cable that
               appeared to be unplugged. The cover for the outlet was laying
               on the ground with the screws. Munson stated that if central IT
               was doing work in this lab they would usually contact him,
               which they had not. Schmuck told me that he contacted FacOps to
               ask if they knew if work was being done in G70 and they did not
               see any work orders for that room. I asked Schmuck and Munson
               if they had located anything else suspicous in the room and
               they said no. I started looking around the lab area and noticed
               a white cable coming out of the ceiling in the middle of the
               room. It appeared as if somebody had been running the cable to
               this point. I asked Munson and Schmuck if that had always been
               like that. They said no, and that this was the first they've
               seen of it. Schmuck then remembered that he had put a request
               in to have the network cable centrally located in the room, and
               this looked like it might be what was going on. He said it made
               sense, but thought it was odd that FacOps knew nothing of it
               since they would have been the one's to run the conduit. Munson
               also thought it was odd that he wouldn't be notified that this
               was going on. I did not find anything else suspicious in the
               lab. I told Schmuck that I would attempt contact with central
               IT and FacOps to see if they knew what was going on. I gave
               Schmuck my business card and asked him to email me if he
               obtained any pertinent information. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 31st day of
