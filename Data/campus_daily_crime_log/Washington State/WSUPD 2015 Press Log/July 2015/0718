               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Bils, Bethany J./062784 Arrested, Cited,
               Released DUI 5Z0829734 2. NARRATIVE: On 07/19/15 at about 0033
               hours I was running stationary radar on Stadium Way, when I saw
               a vehicle approaching southbound at a high rate of speed. I
               activated my Speed Measuring Device in stationary mode. The SMD
               emitted a steady high pitched audio tone. I saw no other
               obstructions between my location and the vehicle when I
               obtained the reading. The SMD displayed a speed of 37 mph for
               the vehicle. At the time of the reading, the vehicle was alone.
               The posted speed limit on Stadium Way is 20 MPH. I began to
               follow the vehicle to catch up to it, it stayed at a high rate
               of speed. The vehicle was in the left lane traveling southbound
               and was weaving in the lane, and crossed the lane dividing
               strip. I activated my emergency lights and attempted to stop
               the vehicle on Stadium Way near the Smith Cue parking lot. The
               vehicle continued in the left lane at a high rate of speed. The
               driver finally pulled over near the Washington building on
               Stadium Way between Nevada St and Spokane St. Traveling about
               500 yards from when I activated my emergency lights. I
               approached the vehicle (OR/540GWU) and contacted the driver. I
               told her the stop was being recorded and asked her for her
               driver's license, registration and proof of insurance. I saw
               she had in her hand a cell phone that was on and had what
               appeared to be a map application up. The driver, Bethany J.
               Bils (062784), gave me her driver's license, and then began to
               look through papers for her registration and proof of
               insurance. I asked her if she knew why I stopped her, she said
               "I'm sure I did something wrong". As she spoke to me her speech
               was slow and slurred. She then handed me her proof of insurance
               and registration. I went back to my vehicle and handed Bils
               information to Officer Kirshner who had arrived on scene. I
               went back to Bils vehicle and asked her if she would step out
               to do some field sobriety tests. She said she would and as she
               exited her vehicle she held her hands up in the air and said
               "are you gonna shoot me? I'm white." She walked to the
               sidewalk. I explained the field sobriety tests were voluntary
               and asked if there was anything that would keep her from doing
               the test, she said there was not. I asked if she wore glasses
               or contacts, she said she did not. She was wearing thong type
               sandals and the sidewalk was smooth concrete with a slight
               grade. I began the standardized field sobriety tests by asking

               her to stand with her feet together, hands at her side, and to
               stay in that position during the first test. The first test is
               the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. I explained to Bils that it
               was an eye test. I explained that during the test she needed to
               follow the top of my pen with her eyes only, and not to move
               her head. Bils said she understood. I observed both of Bils
               pupils were equal size and there was no resting nystagmus. Her
               eyes tracked equally. I observed a lack of smooth pursuit in
               both eyes. I observed distinct and sustained nystagmus at
               maximum deviation in both eyes. I had to ask Bils several times
               to hold her head still during the test, this effected my
               ability to observe the onset of nystagmus prior to 45 degrees
               in either eye. I observed nystagmus in both eyes during the
               vertical gaze nystagmus portion of the test. While I was
               conducting the HGN I also observed Bils swaying approximately
               four to five inches. Her eyes were bloodshot and watery. The
               next test I explained to Bils was the walk and turn. I
               explained to Bils to imagine a line straight out in front of
               her and to place her left foot on that line and then place her
               right foot in front of her left with her heel and toe touching.
               I told her to keep her hands at her sides and to maintain that
               position while I explained the test and not to begin the test
               until I told her to do so. I explained to Bils that she was to
               take nine heel to toe steps along the imaginary line. Then when
               she reached her ninth step to keep that foot planted and make a
               series of small steps to turn around and take nine heel to toe
               steps back along the same line. I demonstrated three steps and
               I also demonstrated the turn and then three return steps,
               explaining that she needed to take the full nine steps down and
               back. I told her that during the test she needed to keep her
               hands at her side, look at her feet while she was walking and
               count her steps out loud. I also told her that once she began
               the test she needed to continue until the test was complete. I
               asked Bils if she had any questions. She did not ask any
               questions at that time. I told her to begin the test. While I
               was explaining the instructions to Bils, she was unable to
               maintain the starting position and stood with her feet side by
               side for most of the instruction phase. As she began the test
               she raised her left arm above her head and her right arm away
               from her side about a foot in order to maintain her balance.
               She then asked "so if you're sober this should be easy?" Bils
               stepped offline on steps three, six, and seven. She did not
               touch heel to toe on step nine. Bils was not counting her steps
               out loud and continued past nine steps and took about sixteen
               to seventeen steps. During the test she stopped and asked if I
               had daughters, she continue asking, I said yes and she then
               continued the test. She stopped again without doing the turn or
               the return steps, I asked if she was done with the test. She
               did not answer and said she would answer if I answered her
               questions. I ended the test. The next test I explained was the
               one leg stand. I instructed Bils to stand with her feet
               together, hands at her side, and to maintain that position
               while I explained the instructions. I also told her not to
               begin the test until I told her to do so. I asked if she
               understood she said she did. I explained that during this test

               she was to lift the foot of her choice so that her foot was six
               inches off the ground and parallel to the ground, with both
               legs straight. Then she was to count out loud by one thousands,
               and I demonstrated the stance and the counting "one thousand
               one, one thousand two, one thousand three". I explained that
               during the test she needed to keep her hands at her side, she
               needed to look at her foot and to count out loud as
               demonstrated. I asked if she had any questions. Bils asked if
               she needed to take the tests, I stated again the tests are
               voluntary and she did not have to take them. She then asked
               what would happen if she did not take them. I explained I would
               make my decision based on my observation to this point. She
               stated she did not want to perform any more test. I placed Bils
               under arrest for DUI, placed her in handcuffs (DL), and told
               her again she was being audio and video recorded. I read her
               Miranda warnings from my department issued Miranda warnings
               card. She said she understood her rights. I searched her
               incident to arrest. I put Bils into the back of my patrol car.
               Offficer Kirshner remained on scene to wait for the tow and I
               transported Bils to Pullman Police Department for the Draeger.
               I arrived at Pullman PD and began the Draeger Alcotest 9510
               with Bils. I read Bils her constitutional rights. Bils refused
               to sign that she had her rights read to her, her constitutional
               rights. She did say she understood her rights and I asked if
               she wanted to speak to an attorney, she said she did. I called
               public defender John Snyder for her and handed her the phone, I
               left her in the attorney room at PPD and closed the door while
               she talked to Snyder. I read Bils the implied consent warnings
               and she signed that she had them read to her at 0133 hours. I
               asked Bils if she would submit to a breath test. She said she
               would submit to a breath test and checked the box on the form
               and initialed it. I checked Bils's mouth at 0137 hours and
               found no foreign substances. My body camera shut off at about
               0149 hours due to low battery. At about 0150 hours Bils rubbed
               her fingers across her lips. I checked her mouth again and
               began another 15 minute observation period. During this
               observation Bils continued to put her hands near her face so I
               placed her back in handcuffs (DL). About 12 minutes into the
               observation period Bils said she could still put her hands in
               her mouth and attempted to put her fingers in her mouth. I
               reached across the counter and controlled her wrist with a
               straight wrist twist lock so she could not. I asked if she
               wanted to stop threatening to put her hand in her mouth and
               cooperate with the process. She said she would and I completed
               the observation period without incident. The breath tube on the
               Draeger was warm to the touch. At 0212 hours Bils provided a
               sample but it did not meet the sample criteria for the Draeger
               and caused an incomplete test. I began the test again and Bils
               provided a breath sample of .177 IR/.180 EC at 0218 hours, and
               a sample of .202 IR/.199 EC at 0221 hours. The breath sample
               was administered in accordance to the methods approved by the
               Washington State Toxicologist pursuant to the Washington
               Administrative Code. Bils was fingerprinted and photographed. I
               provided Bils with the Driver's Hearing Request form, the
               Notice of Hearing/Conditions of Release form, a copy of the
