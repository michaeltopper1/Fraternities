               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3055 SYNOPSIS: Construction workers were
               tearing up the concrete flooring near Webster Hall. Report of
               three bikes locked on different light posts near the
               construction area needing to be moved. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 07-14-15 at approximately 1025
               hours I was dispatched to the report of three bikes locked on
               different light posts near Webster Hall construction area. The
               National Native American Construction Incorporated (NNAC Inc.)
               workers were requesting the bikes to be moved to another
               location so they could continue tearing up the concrete
               flooring. I arrived on scene. I contacted Alex E. Johnson (DOB
               04-24-88) who is in charge of the construction site on the
               northwest side of Webster Hall. Johnson showed me the three
               bikes on the different light posts. There was a white and green
               Old Cannon Run Freespirit that Johnson said was there since 07-
               13-15 at about 0630 hours. There was green and white Fusion
               Novara that he said was there on 07-14-15 at about 0800 or 0900
               hours. Johnson showed me a black and white Havoc Hyper that he
               said was put there at about 1000 hours on 07-14-15. He told me
               the male that left the Havoc Hyper walked over the orange
               construction fencing in order to lock up his bike. He told me
               one of the workers tried yelling at him to not leave it there,
               but he ignored them and walked into Webster Hall. I spoke to
               the construction worker who saw the male leave his bike. She
               described him as having long brown hair and wearing a black t-
               shirt. I walked through Webster Hall, but was unable to locate
               the male. I was unable to locate any of the owners through bike
               serial numbers. I told Johnson I could not remove any of the
               bikes, but WSU Grounds may be able to do something about them.
               I told them if they had to remove the bikes to try and keep the
               lock undamaged. Johnson said they could just remove the light
               posts without damaging the locks if they had to. I took
               photographs of all the bikes, and they have been downloaded
               into Spillman. I cleared the scene. I later received a call
               from Johnson telling me they removed the white and green Old
               Cannon Run Freespirit from the light post. Johnson said he may
               just go buy another bike lock and can lock all the bikes to
               another post later. He said he would leave a note with his
               contact information in case the owners returned. I later called
               WSU Grounds and left them a voicemail seeing if they could pick
               up the white and green Old Cannon Run Freespirit. Johnson told
               me they were going to leave the other two bikes locked on the
               light posts so hopefully their owners would take them before

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3061 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched to an
               unconscious male in a vehicle. I determined there was no
               medical emergency, rather a truck was stalled in the roadway.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 07-14-
               15, Gabriella N. Reznowski (06-11-74) called Whitcom stating a
               male was slumped over in an older green truck near the stop
               light by Gannon Hall. I responded to the area and observed an
               older green truck (ID/1BX1306), stopped on Stadium Way near
               Stephenson North. I exited my patrol vehicle and a male; later
               identified as Faisal S H J A Alajmi (12-11-95) exited the
               truck. He said his truck ran out of gas and he had a friend
               responding with gas. I asked Whitcom to run and attach Alajmi
               and his truck. They advised me Alajmi's Idaho Driver's License
               was "Invalid". I advised Alajmi of this and told him he could
               not drive the truck. He told me he was still dealing with an
               issue with the court. I advised him to contact DOL to see how
               he could fix the problem. A friend arrived on scene with gas.
               They put gas in the truck and had a hard time starting it.
               Alajmi said he wanted to put more gas in the truck and I needed
               to have the roadway cleared. Alajmi said he wanted to get gas
               at the Cenex gas station at the bottom of Stadium Way. I told
               him I would meet him there. As I was driving to the Cenex gas
               station, I asked Whitcom to provide me with further details
               about Alajmi's driving status. They advise he had several
               speeding tickets in the past, had his license suspended at one
               point, and now it was invalid due to point accumulation. I met
               Alajmi in the Cenex gas station parking lot and explained what
               Whitcom had told me. He said he did not understand because he
               was still dealing with the court. I again advised him he should
               contact DOL to get the issue resolved. I told him he could not
               drive or he could be issued an Infraction. I cleared. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.
               Dated this 14th day of July, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #:15-W3062 SYNOPSIS: Subject cited for DUI &
               DWLS, and booked for warrant. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Mary E. Tucci 11/22/93 Cite & Book DUI, DWLS,
               Warrant C09951 2. NARRATIVE: On 07/15/15 at approximately 0209
               hours I heard Ofc. Cornish (PPD) radio a report of a possibly
               intoxicated driver who was also suspended and had a warrant.
               Ofc. Cornish said the driver was Mary Tucci and the vehicle was
               a black Jeep Wrangler (WA ACD2223). I checked the return on the
               vehicle (on my MDC) and saw it came back to Tucci and I saw
               that she was suspended. At approximately 0215 hours I was
               traveling west on NE Colorado St. near parking services when I
               saw a black Jeep Wrangler traveling west on NE Colorado St.
               from B St. I caught up with the vehicle and confirmed the
               license plate was ACD2223. While traveling behind the vehicle I
               noticed it was drifting from one side of the lane to the other.
               I activated my emergency lights and VieVu camera. The vehicle
               continued on NE Colorado St. and turned right onto NE Opal St.
               before coming to a stop. I exited my vehicle and contacted the
               driver. I told her the stop was being recorded and asked if the
               vehicle belonged to her and she said it did. I asked the driver
               if her license was suspended and she said yes. I asked for her
               license, registration and proof of insurance. The driver
               provided me with her expired license (identifying her as Mary
               E. Tucci 11/22/93), and her other documents. While Tucci was
               searching for her documents I could smell the odor of
               intoxicants coming from the vehicle. I noticed Tucci's eyes
               were blood shot and her words were slow and deliberate. I asked
               Tucci how much she had to drink and she said not a lot, and
               then said none. I asked Tucci if I could check her eyes and she
               said I could. I administered an HGN test with Tucci seated in
               the vehicle. I could see a lack of smooth pursuit and a
               distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation in both
               eyes. I returned to my vehicle and asked Whitcom to confirm the
               warrant, which they did. Pullman PD officers Anderson and
               Cornish arrived on scene around this time. I turned off my
               front facing emergency lights and returned to Tucci's vehicle.
               I asked Tucci if she would do some field sobriety tests and she
               agreed to do them. I directed Tucci to the sidewalk on the east
               side of the roadway. I administered the field sobriety tests on
               the level and paved sidewalk. The weather was clear with an
               approximate temperature of 60 degrees. Tucci was wearing a tank
               top, shorts, and flip flops during the tests. Lighting was
               provided by my vehicle spot light and my flash light. The first

               test I administered was the HGN. I told Tucci to follow the tip
               of my pen with her eyes only with out moving her head. I held
               my pen approximately 12-15 inches in front of Tucci's face and
               administered the test. I checked Tucci's eyes and noticed they
               tracked equally and her pupils were equal in size. I did not
               see resting nystagmus in either eye. I saw a lack of smooth
               pursuit and a distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum
               deviation in both eyes. I saw an onset of nystagmus at
               approximately 40 degrees in both eyes. I saw vertical nystagmus
               in both eyes. I noticed Tucci was swaying left to right during
               the test. The next test I administered was the walk and turn. I
               told Tucci to find an imaginary straight line and put her left
               foot on the line. I told Tucci to put her right foot in front
               of her left foot touching heel to toe and leave her arms down
               at her sides. I told Tucci to stay in that position while I
               explained the test. I told Tucci that when I tell her to begin,
               to take nine steps touching heel to toe, watching her feet as
               she walked and count each step out loud. I told Tucci that when
               she gets to step nine, to leave her lead foot in place and
               using her rear foot, take small steps around until facing the
               way she came. I told Tucci to take nine steps back touching
               heel to toe and counting each step out loud. I told Tucci that
               once she started, do not stop. I reminded Tucci to count each
               step out loud, keep her arms at her sides, and watch her feet
               as she walked. I demonstrated the test and asked Tucci if she
               understood and she said yes. I told Tucci to begin at any time.
               Instruction Phase: Tucci swayed left to right in the
               instruction phase and had her left foot in front of her right
               foot, which is opposite of what I explained and demonstrated.
               Tucci had to move her left foot to the left out of the starting
               position to maintain her balance. First Nine Steps: Tucci began
               the test and stepped off line to the right on steps 1, 3, and
               5. Tucci raised her arms from her sides on step 1. Tucci took a
               total of 13 steps. Tucci performed an improper turn by spinning
               on both heels. Tucci stumbled backwards after the turn. Return
               Nine Steps: Tucci stopped after the turn and I reminded her to
               continue with the return steps. Tucci stepped off line to the
               left on steps 2 and 4 and off the line to the right on step 7.
               Tucci missed heel to toe between steps 7/8 and stopped on step
               4 after going off line. Tucci took a total of 14 return steps.
               The next test I administered was the one leg stand. I told
               Tucci to stand with her feet together and her arms down at her
               sides. I told Tucci that when I tell her to begin to raise the
               foot of her choice approximately 6 inches off the ground. I
               told Tucci to point her toe forward, look at her foot, and
               count out loud by 1000's until I tell her to stop. I asked
               Tucci if she understood, and she said yes. I told Tucci to
               begin at any time. Tucci raised her left foot approximately 3
               inches off the ground and began the test. Tucci put her foot
               down on her counts of 1001, 1011, 1013, & 1014. Tucci raised
               her arms from her sides for balance and swayed left to right
               during the test. Tucci did not look at her raised foot during
               the test. Thirty seconds elapsed on Tucci's count of 1014. The
               next test I administered was the PBT. I asked Tucci if she
               would submit to a PBT and she said yes. I checked the PBT (FST

               # 62324) and found it in proper working condition. Tucci gave a
               breath sample of .185 at 0233 hours. At this time it was my
               opinion that Tucci's ability to drive was impaired by alcohol.
               I told Tucci she was under arrest for DUI, DWLS, and a warrant.
               I handcuffed (d/l) Tucci and reminded her she was being audio
               and video recorded. I read Tucci her Miranda Rights at 0235
               hours. I searched Tucci finding no weapons or items of
               evidence. I placed Tucci in the back seat of my patrol car.
               Ofc. Anderson facilitated the tow with Autobody Supercenter. I
               transported Tucci to Whitman County Jail (Pullman PD did not
               have an operational BAC). Upon arrival I checked the Datamaster
               and found it working properly with the RFI antenna attached,
               the mouth tube warm to the touch, and a temperature within
               normal ranged. I read Tucci her Constitutional Rights at 0314
               hours. Tucci said she understood her rights and signed both
               signature blocks. I checked Tucci's mouth and found a lip ring.
               The ring was removed at approximately 0329 hours. There was no
               other foreign substance in Tucci's mouth. I read Tucci her
               Implied Consent Warning for Breath at 0329 hours. Tucci signed
               that it was read to her. I asked Tucci if she would submit to a
               breath test. Tucci checked the "yes" box and initialed next to
               it. Tucci provided a breath sample of .162 at 0349 hours and a
               sample of .158 at 0351 hours. The breath test was administered
               in accordance to the methods approved by the Washington State
               Toxicologist pursuant to the Washington Administrative Code. I
               provided Tucci with a copy of the following documents: Driver's
               Hearing request, notice of hearing/conditions of release, the
               breath test document, and the tow/impound form. I read a copy
               of the warrant to Tucci. I issued Tucci a criminal citation for
               DWLS and DUI. I explained the citation to Tucci and provided
               her a copy of the citation. I turned Tucci over to jail staff.
               Tucci was polite and cooperative during her contact with me. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 15th day of July, 2015, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer
