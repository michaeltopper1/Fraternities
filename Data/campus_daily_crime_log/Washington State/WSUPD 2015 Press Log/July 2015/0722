    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: DBT/321 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3158 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched to an
               agency assist for Whitman Count Sheriff's Office, for a
               trespassing. Subject was verbally trespassed and provided a
               courtesy transport back to his vehicle, by the WCSO. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 07-22-15 at
               approximately 1245 hours dispatch advised WCSO needed
               assistance for a trespassing call, located at 4851 SR 270;
               Wonder Stables. Dispatch advised the complainant, Carl S.
               Landrum (DOB 05-01-59), had caught a male who was trespassing
               on his property by his horses and cows in his pastor. Dispatch
               said the male had run off and was wearing a blue ball cap,
               khaki shirt, and jeans while carrying a white bucket and stick.
               Landrum was now following the male in his truck and last saw
               him walking towards the north side of the WSU USDA property.
               Cpl. Daniels and I responded to the area. I saw a male matching
               the description provided by dispatch walking down a dirt path
               on the northeast side of the WSU USDA property. I told the male
               to set down his bucket and stick and come talk with me. My
               vievu camera was activated and I advised the male I was
               recording. The male later identified himself as Matthew J.
               Scopelite (DOB 11-11-66) by his Idaho Driver's License.
               Scopelite told me he was just checking out the horses on the
               property, but he said he knew he should not be there. He said
               he really likes horses because they help relax him. He told me
               the property owner was really upset when he saw him and that is
               why he ran away. Scopelite mentioned he was afraid the owner
               may try to hurt him. I explained to Scopelite I would be upset
               too if I found someone on my property that did not belong. When
               we asked about his bucket he told us he uses it to collect
               things such as groceries, etc. and that his stick was just a
               walking stick. Cpl. Daniels asked if she may look in his
               bucket, and he gave her permission. There was nothing in the
               bucket. Scopelite told us he came from Lewiston, but he parked
               his vehicle nearby. He told us he parked his vehicle on
               Sunshine Rd. and was just out for a hike. Deputy Jordan soon
               arrived on scene. Cpl. Daniels went and located Scopelite's
               white, 1986 Chevrolet Sprint (ID Lic. #N159679) which was
               parked on Sunshine Rd. Cpl. Daniels then went and spoke with
               Landrum further to see what he wanted us to do with Scopelite.
               Daniels later radioed me and said Landrum would just like
               Scopelite trespassed from his property, but did not want to
               press any charges. Deputy Jordan advised Scopelite he has been
               trespassed from the Wonder Stables and if he is found there

               again he will be arrested. I advised him he was trespassed from
               the WSU USDA property as well. He seemed to understand. Deputy
               Jordan asked permission to frisk Scopelite before he provided
               him with a courtesy transport. Scopelite gave Deputy Jordan
               permission to frisk him. Deputy Jordan frisked Scopelite and
               provided him a courtesy transport back to his vehicle. See WCSO
               case #15-S2113 for full report. Cpl. Daniels and I cleared the
               scene. No further action. My Vievu camera was activated, and
               the video has been downloaded into the permanent digital
               evidence folder. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 22nd day of July, 2015, in
