    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Olmstead/339 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2945 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched to a
               report of a theft at Morrill Hall. The complainant reported
               that two flower planters had been stolen from outside the
               building. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 07-03-2015 at about 1000 hrs I was dispatched to a report of
               a theft at Morrill Hall, located at 355 NE Veterans Way. I
               arrived on scene and contacted the complainant, Maureen C.
               Evermann (DOB 11-11-1945). Evermann stated that she works in
               Morrill Hall and had purchased several flower planters, which
               she placed outside the building on the east side. Evermann
               reported that two of the flower planters were stolen. Evermann
               said the planters have a plastic bottom and are filled with
               flowering plants. Evermann said she placed the planters into
               larger pots she had arranged around the building. Someone had
               simply lifted two of the planters out of the pots and took
               them. Evermann estimated the theft occurred sometime between
               1500 hrs on 07-02-2015 and 0945 hrs on 07-03-2015. Evermann
               said the value for each flower planter was $25.00, for a total
               loss of $50.00. I photographed the scene, and the photographs
               were downloaded into Spillman and attached to this case. No
               suspects of leads were identified. No further action at this
               time. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this __05__ day of

               provided. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 07-03-15 at about 1912 hours I was dispatched to the report
               of a lockout at the US Bank location in the CUB. Whitcom
               advised that Sergey A. Kardash was requesting to be let into
               the CUB to do some business at the US Bank ATM. I found this
               odd given the date and time and considering the CUB was closed
               all day. I asked if Kardash was on the responsible list and was
               told no. I requested Whitcom call a responsible to see if they
               knew Kardash. While waiting for a responsible to call back,
               Whitcom advised that a male named Vladimir Lapik had called and
               said that he was actually the employee that needed the lockout
               assistance and that Kardash is his boss. At this point Whitcom
               adivsed that Linda Mittelhammer had called back and she stated
               that she did not know either male. I responded to the CUB lower
               lot and contacted Vladimir P. Lapik. He was holding a yellow
               bag that said "US Bank" on the side. He told me he needed to be
               let into the CUB so he could exchange the yellow bag at US
               Bank. I asked Lapik if he had his US Bank identification and he
               said no. I told Lapik I was not going to let him in until the
               manager arrived and gave me the approval. I requested
               Mittelhammer respond to the scene. Once she was there she
               confirmed that the yellow bag needed to be exchanged but not
               today since they were not open. Mittelhammer took the bag from
               Vladimir and I went with her inside so she could put the bag
               inside the bank. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 4th day of

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: BRW/325 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W2954 SYNOPSIS: Cougar Security found the
               glass on an entrance door to be shattered. The cause of the
               damage is unknown. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 07/04/15 at approximately 0235 hours, Cougar
               Security unit Sarah Bergman radioed that she had come across an
               exterior door with broken glass on the Veterinarian Biomedical
               Research Building. I meet Bergman on the southside of the
               building. Bergman had already contacted FacOps prior to my
               arrival. Bergman showed me the damaged door. The door was a
               metal frame with a large glass pane insert that took up most of
               the door. The door had a double pane of glass and only the
               exterior pane of glass was shattered. The glass had shattered
               but all was still intact and still in the door. Looking around
               the area I was unable to find any object that was thrown at the
               glass. The glass was perfectly in place but shattered, leading
               me to believe that the glass broke on its own and not by
               someone intentionality breaking it. I took photos of the broken
               glass that were later uploaded to the files folder. The damage
               to the glass is estimated at $150 dollars. END OF REPORT I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 4th day of July, 2015, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer
