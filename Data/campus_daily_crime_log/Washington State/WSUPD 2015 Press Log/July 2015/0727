    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: ENW/328 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3222 SYNOPSIS: Report of a broken window
               and entry into room 15 of Dana Hall. No suspects and no leads.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               07/27/15 around 0835 hrs I was dispatched to a report of a
               broken window in room 15 of Dana Hall. Upon my arrival I spoke
               with Kirk A Reinkens (08/07/64) who told me the following.
               Reinkens explained the robotics lab has key card access as well
               as logs the times when someone leaves the lab. Around 0452 hrs
               on 07/26/15 the log showed someone leaving the lab and there
               was no other entry or exit until the damage was noticed around
               0830 hrs on 07/27/15. We discussed the fire alarm (See Case #:
               15-W3208) being set off around 0516 hrs by a fire extinguisher
               and it possibly being used to make entry to the room. As we
               continued to speak I noticed the window on the east side of the
               room appeared to have been broken into the room, with shards of
               glass on the window ledge and floor. Upon closer inspection I
               noticed there was also glass shards outside in the window well
               below the street level. I photographed the area and asked
               Reinkens if anything was missing. He told me he had looked
               around and did not notice anything out of place. He went on to
               say he didn't believe anything had been taken, explaining a
               laptop computer had been left sitting out as well as other
               valuable equipment which could have been accessed. When I asked
               who had been the last person to have been known to be in the
               lab I given the name Louis R Peyron (06/26/79). Peyron was last
               seen in the lab on 07/24/15 around 1730 hrs, but had access to
               the lab at all hours with his key card access. I obtained
               Peyron's information and provided Reinkens with my business
               card and case number for reference. I also told him if he
               discovered anything was missing to give me a call and let me
               know so I could add it to this report. He told me he would and
               I cleared a short time later. Upon my return to the WSU Police
               Department I contacted Peyron. Peryon explained he had been in
               the lab as described by Reinkens. He went on to tell me he had
               left the lab around 1730 hrs on 07/24/15 and had been in
               Spokane all weekend. Peyron had no idea who may have entered
               the lab and I asked him to give me a call if he noticed
               anything out of place or missing Reinkens did not know of. He
               told me he would and we concluded our call a short time later.
               At this point there are no suspects or leads and I recommend
               this case be closed as inactive until further leads develop. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and

               DEPARTMENT CASE #:15-W3235 SYNOPSIS: PPD requested AOA for
               subject looking to jump in front of an incoming aircraft at
               Pullman Airport. He was taken into Protective Custody. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 072715 at
               approximately 2256 hours PPD requested an AOA for a subject
               looking to jump in front of an incoming aircraft at Pullman
               Airport. Sgt. Griffin and I responded. En route, I had dispatch
               inform the airport of the situation, and confirmed they had a
               commercial aircraft inbound. The RP, Bethany L. Prior (031990),
               was the subject's wife, and had eyes on him at the airport. He
               was waiting at a vehicle gate entrance to the flight line. When
               we arrived I saw the subject, Jason M. Mack (050984), standing
               motionless, in close proximity to the flight line gate. We put
               vehicle spot lights on him and approached on foot. I identified
               us as Police and directed him to get his hands out of his
               pockets and to walk back to the sound of my voice. He turned
               and walked towards us and said something to the effect of we
               "might as well shoot him". He was instructed to face away from
               me and go to his knees. I placed him in handcuffs and patted
               him down for weapons. He was informed he was being detained and
               read his Miranda rights. He said he understood them. Sgt.
               Griffin went and spoke with Prior. Mack said he was "tired' of
               everything and that no one could help him. He was polite and
               cooperative but did not want to speak much. Ofc. Anderson of
               PPD arrived and Sgt. Griffin relayed the details to him. Mack
               admitted to thinking about jumping in front of or onto the
               plane. He was placed in Protective Custody by Ofc. Anderson and
               he transported him to PRH. We cleared. Nothing follows. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 28th day of July, 2015, in Pullman,

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3237 SYNOPSIS: SWAT Call Out for Tyler
               J. Lankford (041988). PPD had PC for Felony Harassment and
               concerns about his mental health. Taken into custody without
               incident. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 072715 at approximately 1334 hours I got a call from PPD
               Ofc. Gordon about a SWAT Call Out. This call was specifically
               for activating the Everbridge system of which I have little to
               no knowledge of. I directed Ofc. Gordon to contact the WSU PD
               station to see if anyone on duty had knowledge. I then
               responded to the station. Dispatch informed me that Sgt. Macy
               was out of town. I had Ofc. Olmstead track down Cpl. Kuhrt.
               Ofc. Boyd and I got ready and proceeded to PPD where were
               received a briefing from Ofc. Gordon and Ofc. Breshears. I made
               sure Negotiators were activated. Sgt. Cooper directed Ofc.
               Boyd, Ofc. McNannay, and I to form an EGO team and set up on
               the hotel room in question. We picked up Deputy Pelissier on
               the way out and briefed him before moving out. We set up as two
               teams on either side of the room. Deputy Pelissier and I
               evacuated 2 maids from a nearby room. Once Negotiators were
               ready, we deployed the throw phone. Sgt. Macy arrived at the
               EGO/Arrest Team site. When the suspect, Tyler J. Lankford
               (041988), exited the room, he was detained with Ofc. Boyd
               putting him in handcuffs. I then took a team into the room for
               a protective sweep and exited the room. Sgt. Macy was left on
               the door until that responsibility could be transferred to PPD.
               Ofc. Boyd effected the handoff of Lankford to PPD. Deputy
               Derosier and I relayed to Ofc. Gordon what we had seen inside
               the room, specifically weapons cases, an oxygen tank, and a
               large mason jar of white powder. We cleared. Nothing follows. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 28th day of July, 2015, in Pullman,
