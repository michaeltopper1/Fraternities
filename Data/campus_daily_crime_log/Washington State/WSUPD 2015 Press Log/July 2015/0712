               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3029 SYNOPSIS: Report of a Burglary
               alarm activation at 935 NE B St. The area was searched and
               nothing of note was observed prior to officers clearing.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               07/12/15 around 0820 hrs PPD officers were dispatched to a
               report of a burglary alarm activation from 935 NE B St. Whitcom
               explained it appeared the location was zoned for WSU and asked
               Sgt Hargraves if he would like us to respond. Initially
               Hargraves did not need our assistance, but later requested us
               to respond to help provide perimeter security while they
               entered and cleared the house. Upon my arrival I contacted Ofc
               Perez, Ofc Gordon, and Hargraves. While speaking with them I
               was asked to cover the front of the house while they entered at
               which time I noticed a window screen adjar from an open window
               just North of the front door. Ofc Whitman covered the rear of
               the house while I remained out front and Pullman Officers
               entered and searched the house with nothing of note being
               observed. Prior to clearing, the alarm was reset and the window
               was closed along with the screen being replaced. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 12th day of July, 2015, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3035 SYNOPSIS: Subject reported $100
               stolen from her room. No suspects or leads. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 071215 at
               approximately 2000 hours I was dispatched to the report of a
               theft from Northside Residence Hall. I responded and met with
               the victim, Elizabeth E. Griffith (102496). She showed me her
               desk where money had been taken from a blue wallet. She was
               quite certain $100 had been taken from a total of $502. She
               believed it was in $20 denominations. The entire residence hall
               of athletes had left the day prior for a retreat at
               approximately 1000 hours and returned at about 1330 hours on
               071215. No one was supposed to be in the hall. Both Griffith
               and her roommate (Maegan L. O'Neill 052397) had left their
               laptops out. Nothing else was taken. I did not see any signs of
               forced entry. Griffith stated she was the one that opened the
               door upon their return and she felt it was secured. She said
               she had talked to the RA and was informed that RED Lee would
               check card swipes when he got back from playing volleyball.
               Griffith stated she had asked her roommate if she knew anything
               about the money and she did not. Griffith does not suspect her
               roommate who was not present. They are teammates on WSU Soccer.
               I provided Griffith with my business card and her case number.
               I then went to find RED Lee. I found him at the SRC and he
               agreed to call me when he was back at his office. He later did
               so and I met him at Northside. He verified that no one had
               accessed Griffith's room via card swipe while they were gone.
               He also did not find anything unusual with regards to people
               swiping into the building during the timeframe in question. He
               sent me the search results of the building access. In case a
               pattern develops I have saved the image to the case. I still
               plan on speaking with O"Neill. Case pending. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               13th day of July, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Mohammed T.D. Alrawili 10/28/91 Cited/Released
               DWLS 3rd 5Z0741556 2. NARRATIVE: On 07/12/15 at approximately
               2204 hours I was driving eastbound on Terre View near North
               Fairway. There was a blue Nissan Maxima in front of me also
               heading eastbound on Terre View. I ran the license plate
               through dispatch and dispatch stated the vehicle's registration
               had expired on 04/30/15. I initiated a traffic stop at Terre
               View and Palouse Ridge Golf Course. I contacted the driver,
               Mahammed Turki D. Alrawili 10/28/91, identified myself, in
               formed Alrawili that I was recording, and explained the reason
               for the stop. Alrawili said he had just arrived back in the
               United States from Saudi Arabia. I asked Alrawili for his
               driver's license, vehicle registration, and proof of insurance.
               Alrawili provided me with his Saudi Arabia Driver's License and
               Washington vehicle registration. Alrawili said he did not have
               his proof of insurance with him because he had just purchased
               new insurance the other day. I returned to my patrol car and
               ran Alrawili through dispatch. Alrawili had a Washington
               tracking record that stated he was suspended in the 3rd degree.
               The suspension was from a ticket he received in the city of
               Spokane on 06/23/14 that he had not paid. About this time Ofc.
               Whitman arrived on scene. I filled out a Sector citation for
               DWLS 3rd degree, no proof of insurance, and expired
               registration over two months. After the citations were complete
               I returned to Alrawili and asked him to talk to me on the
               sidewalk. Once out of the car, I asked Alrawili if he
               remembered receiving a traffic ticket in Spokane. Alrawili said
               he did and admitted to not paying it. I told Alrawili that
               technically he was currently under arrest for driving on a
               suspended license however I was not going to handcuff him. I
               explained the citations to Alrawili and provided him with his
               copies. Ofc. Whitman spoke with Alrawili's passenger, Thamer J.
               Alruwaili 11/16/93, who also provided a Saudi Arabia driver's
               license. Alruwaili's return came back clear. Alruwaili took
               over driving and both units cleared. END OF REPORT I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.

               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 07/13/15 at
               approximately 0141 hours, I was dispatched to a suspicious call
               at the Steam Plant on College Ave. I meet with the reporting
               party, Daniel Wayne Richards 01/16/79, who stated he found a
               semi-truck trailer with the rear doors open. Richards said the
               trailer belongs to an asbestos removal company who was doing
               work on the WSU campus. Richards said the doors to the trailer
               were closed the night before. I looked in the trailer and found
               it completely empty. There was no lock on the doors so it was
               most likely left unlocked on purpose. It did not appear that
               the trailer had held anything in a long while. Richards said he
               sees the asbestos guys meeting near the trailer most mornings
               around 0730 hours. Ofc. Whitman said he would contact the group
               in the morning to make sure nothing was stolen. END OF
