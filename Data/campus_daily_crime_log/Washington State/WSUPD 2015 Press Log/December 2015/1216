    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Whitman / 323 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W6507 SYNOPSIS: While investigating
               another case I was advised of an assault that occurred earlier
               in the semester. Investigation continues. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 12/17/15 at about 0100
               while investigating another case I was made aware of an
               incident that occurred earlier in the semester. While talking
               to a suspect in another case she mentioned an incident where
               Megan Bickford had thrown a male out of her dorm room and left
               marks on his arm. I talked to Bickford and she said she
               remember the incident and it had not been reported. She said
               she was asleep one night and awoken by her roommate, Katie
               Buchanan, having sex. Bickford said she tossed something from
               her shelf at them and then asked the male, later identified as
               Kyler Kirkpatrick to leave the dorm room. She said at one point
               she took Kirkpatrick by the arm and escorted him out of the
               room. Bickford said she is currently friends with Kirkpatrick
               and they have not had any further incidents. As I was leaving
               Coman Hall I saw a male standing near Officer Welter who was
               interviewing Buchanan for the other case. I recognized him from
               another call earlier in the semester and asked if his name was
               Kyler, He said it was. I asked him about the incident from
               about a month ago when Bickford kick him out Coman room 314. He
               said he did remember the incident. I asked if he could describe
               what happened. He was reluctant to talk about it. I told him he
               had done nothing wrong, I was just attempting to determine what
               happened that night. He said he didn't want to get anyone in
               trouble. I again asked what happened. Kirkpatrick said he was
               in the room with Buchanan when Bickford woke up. She asked him
               to leave and as he was getting ready to leave Bickford toke him
               by the arm and escorted him out the door. I asked Kirkpatrick
               if he felt it was a reasonable amount of force for the
               situation. He felt it was excessive and it did leave marks on
               his arm. He also stated adamantly that he did not want to press
               charges or get Bickford in trouble. Investigation continues. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this ____ day of _____________, 2015, in
