               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W6315 SYNOPSIS: I responded to Johnson
               Hall, room C105 to speak with two females regarding Service
               Animals on the WSU campus. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR#
               1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 12-09-15, at approximately 1122 hours, I
               responded to Johnson Hall and met Marissa L. Bernhofer (09-08-
               88) in the hallway just outside of room C105. Bernhofer said
               she uses a service animal to help her and is upset because
               another female in her class carries a small dog to class and
               keeps it in her purse. Bernhofer said she does not believe the
               small dog belonging to the other female; who I later identified
               as Caitlyn E. Munro (07-08-90), is actually a service animal
               and should not be allowed in class. I told Bernhofer I did not
               know enough about the rules surrounding service animals to make
               a determination on what I should and could do, but told her I
               would educate myself and get back to her. I also told her I
               would speak with Munro prior to getting back to her. Just after
               the class ended, I entered the classroom and asked Munro if I
               could speak with her about her dog. She immediately became
               upset and said something to the effect of "You cannot ask me if
               I have a disability". I told her I wasn't going to ask her
               about any disability, I just needed to ask her a few questions
               about a call which came in to our dispatch center. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.

               subject who was contacted and found to be fine. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 12-09-15 at
               approximately 1201 hours, Cpl. Edwards and I responded to
               Chinook Apt #C15 for a welfare check. The RP was concerned as
               the subject, Henry Jaakola had withdrawn from classes
               yesterday. According to the RP, Henry has depression and has a
               pattern of withdrawing from school. When he withdraws, he seems
               to be suicidal. The RP today had heard what he thought was
               clicking of a gun and knows Henry possesses one. When we
               arrived at the apartment, we knocked on the door several times
               with no answer. We also rang the doorbell. A short time later,
               the RP provided us access to the apartment and stated they
               believed Henry was in the shower. I did a sweep of the
               apartment and did not seen anyone, but the bathroom door was
               closed and the light was on. I knocked on the bathroom door and
               asked Henry if he would come out and speak with us, and he
               stated he would. Henry came out of the bathroom wearing a
               towel. I told him we were there because someone was concerned
               about him. Henry did not seem surprised to see us and never
               asked who called. He stated he had not been doing well in
               classes and had contacted his parents about it. He stated they
               had agreed with him that he should withdraw from class so he
               did yesterday. As I had done the sweep of the bedrooms, I saw a
               gun case with a holster on the bed in Henry's room. I asked him
               if he had a gun in the apartment and he said yes and stated it
               was a handgun. I asked him if I could look at it and he said
               yes. I asked if it was loaded and he said no, but the box had
               loaded magazines in it with the gun. He stated it was in the
               box on his bed. I went into the room and he stated it might be
               locked, but the locks maybe open. I went to the box and saw the
               locks were open. I again made sure he was ok with me looking at
               the gun and he said yes. I opened the box and found a CZ 75 D
               compact 9mm handgun. I picked up the weapon and observed it was
               warm to the touch. I asked Henry about this and he stated he
               had a CPL and had worn the gun to breakfast and had recently
               returned. I checked to make sure the weapon was clear and it
               was. The case had two loaded magazines next to the handgun and
               I removed these from the case. Henry asked if I wanted to see
               his CPL and I said yes. I observed it was issued by Pullman PD
               and was valid. I talked with Henry about the rules surrounding
               firearms in WSU Housing and on campus and he stated he
               understood. I advised him I would be taking the handgun with me

               and would check it in at the station for him. I advised him of
               the procedure for gun checks and he stated he understood. He
               was asked if he had any other weapons in the apartment, in
               particular a rifle or shotgun, and he said no. Henry was asked
               about suicidal thoughts and he stated he did not have any
               thoughts of hurting himself. He stated he had been stressed
               about school and his roommate moving out, but was not planning
               to harm himself. He stated he was planning on going home on the
               19th. While speaking with Henry, I did not have any signs he
               was currently suicidal. I provided him with my business card
               and advised him to call if he had any questions or wanted to
               talk. We cleared the apartment and contacted the RP. The RP he
               stated the sounds he had heard sounded like someone loading a
               magazine with bullets, but not with dry firing the gun. I
               advised him of what Henry had told us about the handgun and he
               stated it was consistent with what he had heard. I advised the
               RP to call if he had any further concerns and he stated he
               would. I then contacted WSU Counseling Services as Henry had
               stated he had been seeing a counselor. I advised them of the
               incident today and they stated they understood. I was later
               able to contact Dean of Students Office who were aware of the
               incident. I briefed them on what had happened. I filled out the
               weapons check in card for Henry's handgun. The case was locked
               and checked into the storage room. Refer to Student Conduct. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W6325 SYNOPSIS: Report of the odor of
               marijuana. 2 subjects contacted and warned. NAME/DOB ACTION

               Possession of MJ<40 gm NARRATIVE: On 12/09/15 I was dispatched
               to a report of the odor of marijuana coming from room 327 of
               Stephenson East. Upon my arrival on the third floor I
               immediately noticed the odor of burnt marijuana which grew in
               intensity as I approached room 327. Once I reached room 327 I
               smelled around the crack of the door and noticed the odor I had
               noticed in the hallway seemed to be coming from within the
               room. I knocked on the door and prior to the door opening I
               heard what sounded like items being moved and put way. The door
               was eventually opened by a male, later identified as Michael C
               Key (09/08/06), and I asked him if he knew why I was there.
               Initially he told me he had no idea why I was knocking at his
               door. As we spoke I noticed Key's pupils appeared to be much
               larger than normal given the current lighting conditions, and
               based upon my training and experience I recognized this as a
               possible sign of having smoked marijuana. Key and I continued
               to speak and I told him the reason I was there was due to the
               odor coming from inside of his room. I asked him if I could
               speak with him and was invited into the room where I spoke with
               him and another male, identified as Ethan D Marquez (082297),
               who told me the following. As we continued to speak both
               Marquez and Key admitted to having smoked marijuana and still
               being in possession of a small amount, which they volunteered
               to destroy. We discussed this and the legal issues regarding
               possession of marijuana in the State of Washington. After the
               conversation Marquez and Key offered to destroy the remaining
               marijuana and speak with hall staff. After explaining I would
               be sending this case to student conduct we left the room. I
               briefly spoke with hall staff, providing them with a brief
               overview of what I had learned along with the case number. I
               also told them Marquez was willing to speak with them and Key
               would also be willing to speak with them after he and I
               destroyed to remainder of the marijuana. Key and I left a short
               time later at which point Key destroyed the remaining marijuana
               and glass bong before returning to the building. I cleared a
               short time later and returned to patrol. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of

               hours I was dispatched to the report of the odor of marijuana
               emitting from Regents Hall #377, located at 1580 NE Cougar Way.
               Ofc. Westerman and I arrived on scene. The hall director,
               Richard A. Wallace (DOB 07-03-90), and a Resident Advisor (RA)
               met us in the lobby. Wallace told us the RA had smelled the
               odor of marijuana in the room earlier, but now it mostly smells
               like a lot of perfume and different fragrances. I asked the RA
               if any of the individuals in the room are 21 or older, and she
               said no. I asked if any of them left the room, and she said
               they were still inside. Ofc. Westerman and I went to room #377,
               and I knocked on the door. I could smell the strong odor of
               fragrances coming from the room. A female later identified as
               Shelbie M. Mikesell (DOB 12-08-96) answered the door. There was
               a female sitting on one of the beds who was identified as Elsa
               L. Lindsay (DOB 09-10-96). I asked Mikesell if she knew why I
               was there, and she said no. I said because of the marijuana,
               and she said yeah. I asked if anyone else was in the room with
               her, and she looked over at Lindsay who was sitting on the bed.
               I asked if either of them were 21 years of age or older, and
               they both said no. I asked if they had a medical marijuana
               card, and they both said no. I told Mikesell and Lindsay to
               gather up there marijuana and drug paraphernalia. Mikesell told
               me her roommate was out of the room, and that she knows where
               all the marijuana and paraphernalia is. Ofc. Westerman asked if
               she was in a kitchenette, and Lindsay said yeah. I asked if
               they had been smoking in the room, and they both said yes. I
               asked what they were using to smoke with, and Lindsay said a
               pipe. Ofc. Westerman went down the hallway and later returned
               with another female, who was identified as Morea Schofield (DOB
               08-02-97). I asked Schofield if she could gather up her
               marijuana, and she replied "I don't have any marijuana". I told
               Schofield that her friends told me otherwise. Schofield brought

               over a drawstring bag, and she opened it up. She pulled out a
               glass pipe with burnt marijuana residue in it. I asked her how
               much marijuana was in the bag, and she said it was not in the
               bag but she would go get it. Schofield began searching around
               her bed for it, but was not brining anything back. She kept
               saying she could not find it. Schofield said that they must
               have smoked it all. I asked Schofield where they had been
               smoking marijuana, and she replied they were smoking outside. I
               told her she needed to start being more honest with me because
               her friends said they had been smoking in the room. I told her
               she was being sent to WSU Student Conduct and that her
               dishonesty was not going to help her case. Schofield walked
               back to the drawstring bag that contained the glass pipe. She
               opened it up and there was a metal grinder inside containing a
               small amount of fresh marijuana. Schofield put on her shoes to
               walk outside to the dumpster with me. I told all of them they
               would be referred to WSU Student Conduct. As we were walking
               out to the dumpster Schofield apologized to me for lying to me
               earlier. I had her dump her marijuana inside the dumpster. She
               threw the glass pipe and metal grinder inside the dumpster as
               well. Ofc. Westerman and I cleared the scene. No further
               action. My Vievu camera was activated, and the video was later
               downloaded into the permanent digital evidence folder. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of

               05/24/81 Contacted 2. NARRATIVE: On 12/09/15 at approximately
               2123 hours, I was dispatched to a welfare check. The reporting
               party, Raymundo L. Acunaluna 10/05/85, reported seeing a
               message thread on the WSU Parent Facebook page where a "Jessica
               Cantibury" had made statements about suicide. Acunaluna was
               able to take screen shots of the messages and sent them to my
               email. Acunaluna also stated it appeared that Cantibury may be
               meeting someone at the CUB. I researched "Jessica Cantibury" in
               the WSU Directory and found no matches. Using Facebook I did
               locate a "Jessica Cantibury" which the profile stated she was
               affiliated with WSU and EWU. The Facebook account was locked
               down and I was unable to gather any other information. I went
               to the CUB and asked the information desk if they had noticed
               anybody that appeared to be meeting someone and they said no.
               There were approximately 30 people in the CUB, most studying. I
               noticed one female was not studying so I asked her if she was
               Jessica. The female, Sarah Lynn Martin 08/18/95, said she was
               not however she was waiting for Jessica to arrive. I spoke to
               Martin who stated she had received a call from her parents who
               told her of the Facebook messages. Martin logged onto Facebook
               and message Jessica saying they could meet up. Martin said
               Jessica had messaged that she would be right over. I waited for
               approximately 20 minutes for Jessica to arrive but she did not
               do so. I gave Martin my phone number and told her to call me if
               Jessica showed up. About 10 minutes later Martin called and
               stated Jessica showed up and they would be sitting at Reunion.
               Martin stated that Jessica did not look like her Facebook
               account. Ofc. Whitman and I walked over to Reunion where I
               found Martin talking to "Jessica Cantibury." It was later
               determined that "Jessica Cantibury" was really Osha Morningstar
               05/24/81. I asked Morningstar if we could talk and she seemed
               hesitant. Morningstar made a comment to Martin about how the
               Police always mess things up. I spoke with Morningstar and
               asked what was going on. Morningstar told me she had reported
               that she had been sexually assaulted to WSUPD in September 2015
               and was very upset about how the case had been handled. I let
               Morningstar speak uninterrupted for several minutes about the

               assist her with and she did not come up with anything. I told

               Morningstar that I was unfamilier with her case and would have
               to review it prior to answering questions about it. I told
               Morningstar if she wanted to come over to the station I could
               review the investigation and try to answer her questions.
               Morningstar stated she would come over with Martin in a little
               bit. Due to Morningstar's vague Facebook comments, I asked her
               if she felt like hurting herself. Morningstar said no.
               Morningstar stated she was not suicidal, depressed, or had any
               intentions of causing harm to herself. I returned to the
               station and waited approximately 30 minutes until Morningstar
               and Martin arrived. While waiting I reviewed the screen shots
               that Acunaluna had sent me. After reviewing the message thread,
               Morningstar expressed her frustration with the process of
               reporting her sexual assault. Morningstar was also stating that
               she just needed to talk to someone as a friend and get a hug.
               At no point during the conversation did Morningstar elude to
               harming herself in any way. Once Moringstar and Martin arrived
               at the station I had them sit down in the conference room and
               answered questions Moringstar had. I tried to explain what had
               happened so far in the case the best I could off my quick read
               of the case. Moringstar had several policy changes that she
               wanted to discuss and stated that she had a meeting with Chief
               Gardner in the morning about her complaints. Morningstar spoke
               for about 30 minutes about her frustrations with the case and
               the culture of sexual assault. I asked if there was anything I
               could help her with tonight and she said no. Martin and
               Morningstar left together. During the interview, Morningstar
               was visibly upset and emotional. Morningstar had expressed her
               poor experience with ATVP and counselors at the hospital so I
               did not bring up the topic in an attempt not to further agitate
               her. This case will be referred to WSU Counseling services. My
               contact with Morningstar was recorded on my VieVu camera and
               the camera footage was uploaded to the department's computer.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W6330 SYNOPSIS: Subject arrested for DUI.
               Subject refused breath and a search warrant was obtained.
               Pending the results of the Toxicology Lab, charges of DUI will
               be forwarded to the Prosecutor. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Ana Camila Chavez 03/28/94 Charges Forward DUI
               2. NARRATIVE: On December 10th, 2015 at approximately 0045
               hours I was driving a marked patrol car (vehicle 4) eastbound
               on Terre View near Chief Joseph Apartments when I noticed a
               Toyota Camry heading northbound on North Fairway Road
               approaching the intersection of Terre View. The Toyota slowed
               down for the stop sign but never came to a complete stop before
               proceeding to turn left onto Terre View westbound. The Toyota
               appeared to be accelerating quickly and I activated my in car
               radar. I watched as the radar reading climbed from 23 MPH to 35
               MPH as the car passed me. That section of Terre View is 25 MPH.
               I turned around to catch up to the car which appeared to be
               still accelerating. I caught up to the Toyota at Terre View and
               Merman Drive and initiated a traffic stop. I contacted the
               driver, ANA CAMILA CHAVEZ 03/28/94, identified myself, informed
               the driver I was recording, and explained the reason for the
               stop. I asked for CHAVEZ's driver's license, proof of
               insurance, and vehicle registration. I asked CHAVEZ how much
               she had to drink and she looked at me and said none. As soon as
               she said none she obverted her eyes from me and stared at her
               lap. Recognizing the indicator of deception. I asked CHAVEZ if
               I could check her eyes and she stated yes. I preformed an HGN
               test on CHAVEZ as she sat in the vehicle. I told CHAVEZ to
               follow the tip of my finger with her eyes only and do not move
               her head. During the HGN test I observed equal pupil size,
               equal tracking, and lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes. I
               could smell the strong odor of intoxicants coming from CHAVEZ's
               breath as she was turned towards me. I asked CHAVEZ to come
               talk to me outside the car. CHAVEZ exited and I asked her if
               she was willing to do some voluntary standardized field
               sobriety tests. CHAVEZ stated she would. About this time Ofc.
               Welter arrived on scene. The tests were conducted on a level
               and paved parking lot of CCN apartment complex. CHAVEZ was
               wearing a knit sweater, over coat, skirt, and calf high leather
               boots at the time of the tests. The parking lot was lit by
               street lights, patrol car spot light, and personal flashlight.
               The first test I administered was the HGN test. I instructed
               CHAVEZ to stand with her heels and toes together and keep her
               arms at her sides. I told CHAVEZ to remain in that position

               while I administered the test. CHAVEZ stated she understood. I
               told CHAVEZ to follow the tip of my pen with her eyes only and
               not to move her head. I held my pen approximately 12-15 inches
               away from CHAVEZ's head. About this time Ofc. Whitman arrived
               on scene. During the test I observed, equal pupil size, equal
               tracking, lack of smooth pursuit, and distinct and sustained
               nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes. During the
               beginning of the test CHAVEZ was swaying side to side. I gave
               CHAVEZ several breaks to blink her eyes because she said her
               eyes were dry. While CHAVEZ was standing before me I could
               clearly smell the strong odor of intoxicants coming from her
               breath. The next test I administered was the walk and turn. I
               told CHAVEZ to place her left foot on an imaginary line before
               her. I then instructed CHAVEZ to place her right foot heel to
               toe in front of her left foot and keep her arms at her side.
               CHAVEZ got into the starting position as instructed. I told
               CHAVEZ to remain in that position as I gave further
               instructions. I told CHAVEZ, when I tell you to begin, don't
               begin until I tell you, you will take a series of nine heel to
               toe steps down the line, with your arms at your side, looking
               down at your feet, and counting your steps out loud. Once you
               reach your ninth step leave your lead foot planted and with
               your rear foot take a series of small steps until you are
               facing where you came from and again take nine return heel to
               toe steps. I demonstrated the test for CHAVEZ. I reminded
               CHAVEZ to keep her arms at her side, count her steps out loud,
               look down at her feet, and do not stop the test until she had
               completed it. I asked CHAVEZ if she understood and CHAVEZ said
               she did. I asked CHAVEZ if she would like me to demonstrate the
               test again and she said no. Instruction Phase: During the
               demonstration CHAVEZ stepped out of the starting position
               twice. First Nine Steps: During the first nine steps CHAVEZ did
               not attempt to touch heel to toe, rather she was walking
               normally. CHAVEZ had a gap of approximately 3 to 5 inches
               between her heel and toe while walking. CHAVEZ had her arms out
               at an approximate 45 degree angle while walking. CHAVEZ also
               was looking to the horizon as she walked and not down at her
               feet. When CHAVEZ reached her 9th step she stopped and looked
               back towards me saying, "is that ok." I asked CHAVEZ if she was
               done and she asked if she needed to do more steps. I told
               CHAVEZ to complete the test as I had instructed. CHAVEZ took
               one more step and stopped saying she did her 9 steps. I told
               CHAVEZ to stop. At no point did CHAVEZ attempt a turn or her
               return 9 steps. The next test I administered was the One Leg
               Stand. I instructed CHAVEZ to stand with her heels and toes
               together and keep her arms at her side. I told CHAVEZ to remain
               in that position while I gave her further instructions. I told
               CHAVEZ, when I tell you to begin, don't begin until I tell you,
               you will raise either leg of your choice and raise it six
               inches off the ground. You must point your toe so the sole of
               your shoe is parallel with the ground. While pointing your toe,
               keep your arms at your side, leg straight, look down at your
               foot and count out loud, one thousand one, one thousand two,
               one thousand three, and so on until I tell you to stop. I
               demonstrated the test as I explained it. I asked CHAVEZ if she

               understood and she stated yes. I asked CHAVEZ if she would like
               me to demonstrate the test again and she said yes. Once I
               demonstrated for a second time CHAVEZ said she understood.
               While getting my watch ready for the test CHAVEZ raised her leg
               to begin the test. When I told CHAVEZ to begin she raised her
               left leg and started counting 1 Mississippi, 2 Mississippi, and
               so on. CHAVEZ put her foot down after two seconds and again
               after 6 seconds. After 6 Mississippi, CHAVEZ stopped counting
               out loud. CHAVEZ put her foot down 5 more time before I stopped
               counting. CHAVEZ used her arms for balance several times
               throughout the test. I told CHAVEZ that the last test I had for
               her was the PBT. I explained what the PBT was, that it was
               voluntary, and it did not replace the evidentiary breath test.
               CHAVEZ asked what would happen if she decided not to provide a
               sample. I told CHAVEZ that either way I was going to arrest her
               for DUI. CHAVEZ said she did not want to take it. I told CHAVEZ
               that she was under arrest for DUI and handcuffed (D/L) her. I
               advised that she was being audio and video recorded. CHAVEZ was
               read her Miranda Rights and CHAVEZ stated she understood her
               rights. CHAVEZ was searched incident to arrest and nothing of
               evidentiary value was found. I placed CHAVEZ in the back seat
               of my patrol car. I told CHAVEZ that the vehicle was going to
               be towed and wanted to know if there was anything in the car
               she wanted out of it. CHAVEZ stated he cell phone and purse.
               Ofc. Whitman stayed with the vehicle and I transported CHAVEZ
               to Pullman Police Department for BAC. At 0118 hours I checked
               CHAVEZ's mouth finding no foreign substances. I read CHAVEZ her
               Constitutional Rights at 0120 hours. CHAVEZ stated she
               understood her rights and signed she understood her rights and
               decided not to exercise her rights. I read CHAVEZ the Implied
               Consent Warning for Breath and CHAVEZ signed that it had been
               read to her at 0126 hours. CHAVEZ checked the no box that she
               was not willing to provide a breath sample. I told CHAVEZ that
               I would be applying for a search warrant for her blood. I
               returned to the station and applied for a search warrant for
               CHAVEZ's blood. I was granted a search warrant by Judge
               Robinson and returned to Pullman Holding Facility to serve it.
               Once medics were on scene I read a copy of the warrant to
               CHAVEZ and the medics. At 0315 hours I watched as Medic Robert
               Javosch swabbed the crook of CHAVEZ's left arm with 1% iodine.
               I watched as Javosch drew blood into the two grey topped vials.
               Both the medics and CHAVEZ were provided with a copy of the
               warrant, a return of search, and a receipt of property taken. I
               provided CHAVEZ a copy of the following documents: Driver's
               Hearing Request, tow and impound form, and the breath test
               document. The seized blood was logged and marked to be sent to
               the State Toxicology Laboratory. CHAVEZ was finger printed and
               photographed. CHAVEZ's vehicle was impounded by Myers Towing
               for 12 hours. Pending the results of the Toxicology Lab, I will
               be forwarding charges of DUI to the Prosecutor. My VieVu camera
               footage was uploaded to the department's computer. END OF

               be sleeping in his vehicle in a parking lot on campus. I
               contacted the subject, he was safe, healthy and said he would
               be looking for housing for next semester. Nothing further.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               12/09/15 I received an e-mail from Lieutenant Larson stating
               someone reported a male who was sleeping in his vehicle in the
               green parking lot at Johnson Hall. He asked if graveyard shift
               could check on his welfare. At 0248 hours on 12/10/15 I saw the
               vehicle (WA/AJV9318) and contacted the male, Rex Yu. Yu was
               asleep in his vehicle. He opened the door and talked to me. Yu
               said he was not getting along with his roommates at Valleyford
               apartments. Instead of inconvenience his other friends by
               asking to stay with them he was sleeping in his vehicle. Yu
               does have the appropriate parking pass for the lot his in. The
               registration for his vehicle expired 10/29/15, and I advised
               him it was expired. I asked if you was in fear of his roommates
               or having any thoughts of hurting himself. Yu said he was not
               in fear of his roommates and he was not having thoughts of
               harming himself. He said he we just not getting along with his
               roommates and planned on terminating his contract and finding a
               new place to live for next semester. I gave Yu my business card
               and explained it had number for assistance if he needed any. I
               told him he could also contact WSU housing and they may be able
               to set him up with temporary housing for the remainder of the
               semester. I cleared the call. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               10th day of December, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W6333 SYNOPSIS: Subject reported a
               suspicious male in the Holland Library. Subject said the
               subject was yelling, and she was unsure why. Officers arrived
               on scene and were unable to locate the male, and did not hear
               any yelling in the area. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR#
               1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 12-10-15 at approximately 0338 hours I was
               dispatched to the report of a suspicious male in the basement
               of the Holland Library, located at 1400 NE Terrell Mall.
               Dispatch advised the complainant, Magdalena Garcia Arce (DOB
               07-31-93), described the individual as a black male wearing a
               grey beanie. Dispatch said Garcia Arce was unsure what study
               room he was in, but that he was yelling for what appeared to be
               no reason. Ofc. Whitman and I arrived on scene. We walked
               around the basement of Holland Library, but were unable to
               locate the male. We talked to several students, and none of
               them had heard anyone yelling. We walked over to Terrell
               Library to try to locate the male. We went down to the basement
               and walked all around. We spoke with several different students
               studying, and none of them had heard anyone yelling. WSUPD
               Intern Pacer Said was working security at the library. He
               walked over to Ofc. Whitman and I, and he told us he had spoke
               with Garcia Arce earlier. Intern Said was in the area when
               Garcia Arce had reported the yelling, but he said he had not
               heard anything. Intern Said walked us over to Garcia Arce. She
               told me the male who was yelling had been sitting in a desk
               directly behind her. She said he began yelling on the phone for
               no apparent reason, and she got scared. Garcia Arce said she
               did not make direct eye contact with him, and she described him
               as a tall black male wearing a grey beanie hat and a black
               jacket. I told her to call back if she hears the male yelling
               again. We cleared the scene. No further action. My Vievu camera
               was activated, and the video was later downloaded into the
               permanent digital evidence folder. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 10th day of
               December, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.
