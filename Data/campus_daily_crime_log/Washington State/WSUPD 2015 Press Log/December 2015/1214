               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W6441 SYNOPSIS: Report of a Hit & Run
               Accident in the WSU Student Recreation Center parking lot.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 12-14-
               15, I was dispatched to a Hit & Run accident which occurred in
               the WSU Student Recreation Center parking lot. Wesley S. McCann
               (12-28-90), called Whitcom stating he observed a dark blue
               Dodge Intrepid strike a white Ford truck in the WSU SRC parking
               lot. The asian male driver of the Intrepid got out of his car
               to see if there was damage to the truck, got back in his car
               without leaving a note of any kind, and drove away. McCann said
               he believed the letters "AQH" were part of the Intrepid's
               license plate number, but was not sure. He said the Ford's
               license plate was B76658L. He told Whitcom the Intrepid turned
               right onto North Fairway Lane, toward Beasley Colesium when it
               left the SRC parking lot. I left the station and drover around
               trying to locate the Dodge Intrepid, but was unable to do so. I
               asked Whitcom to see if they were able to find a vehicle in
               their system matching the description of the Intrepid and they
               said they were not able to do so. I drove to the SRC parking
               lot and located the Ford truck which had been struck by the
               Intrepid. There was a lot of older damage to the truck so I am
               not sure if any damage happened as a result of the Intrepid
               apparently striking it. I took photos of the passenger side
               front portion of the truck and downloaded them into the "Files"
               section of the case. I left my business card on the truck with
               a note asking the driver to contact me if there was any new
               damage to the truck. As of 1554 hours on 12-14-15, I have not
               received a phone call or e-mail from the driver of the vehicle.
               More to follow. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 14th day of December, 2015, in

               entered his vehicle. Derry said that the contents in the
               passenger compartment of his vehicle appeared to be rummaged
               through. Derry said he had a pair of Nikon "Trailblazer"
               binoculars inside his vehicle, and they were missing. Derry
               said the binoculars were green in color. The value of the

               and contacted the complainant, Philip T. Gialanella (DOB 05-16-
               1994). Gialanella was a Bookie employee. Gialanella reported
               that he was working the cash register at the Bookie sometime in
               October 2015. Gialanella could not remember what specific date
               and time he was working. Gialanella said he removed his watch
               and placed it on the counter near the cash register. Gialanella
               left work and realized later that he left his watch on the
               counter. The next day Gialanella returned to work and could not
               find his watch. For the past two months, Gialanella was
               confused and did not know what to do. Gialanella and I met with
               management staff from the Bookie and determined that his watch
               had been found and was turned in as lost property. Gialanella's
               watch was returned to him, and I cleared the scene. No further

               Kristin L. Irvine (121596) Warned Drugs NARRATIVE: On 121415 at
               approximately 1651 hours, I was dispatched to a report of the
               odor of marijuana coming from room 409 Stephenson North. Upon
               arrival, I contacted Justeen A. Montelongo who is the hall
               director on duty for Stephenson North. Montelongo told me she
               smelled a faint odor of marijuana coming from the room, but the
               resident advisors told her it was much stronger before I
               arrived. I smelled the door and only smelled a strong odor of
               cologne coming from the room. I knocked on the door and a male
               later identified as Andre G. De Los Rios answered the door. I
               asked him to have all occupants of the room to exit and talk to
               me in the hallway. I contacted Cole N. Weatherspoon and Kristin
               L. Irvine who were also in the room and came into the hallway.
               I explained to the three of them I was there for the odor of
               burning marijuana coming from their room. De Los Rios and
               Weatherspoon stated there was no marijuana in their room and
               that they don't smoke in their room anymore. The told me they
               were just inside eating pizza. I told them I didn't smell the
               odor of marijuana in the room, but that is what was reported to
               me. I checked all of their eyes and didn't see any bloodshot or
               watery eyes on any of them. I noticed in the room the window
               was open. Based on my training and experience, I know that the
               odor of marijuana dissipates quickly when windows are open and
               the odor of cologne is heavy. I advised all three subjects they
               were going to be sent to student conduct by Hall Staff and
               likely they would get my report as well. I warned all three and
               advised them they were free to leave. I talked to Montelongo
               and she advised that before I arrived, De Los Rios and
               Weatherspoon left the room briefly and then returned. She
               believed they removed the marijuana from the room and then came
               back. I advised her to write up their report and submit it to
               Student Conduct. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 15th day of
               November, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               Degree Charges to be forwarded 2. NARRATIVE: On 121415 at
               approximately 1753 hours, I was dispatched to contact Leslie
               Martin at the WSU Bookie in the CUB regarding a theft. Upon
               arrival, I contacted Timothy R. Ruggiero who is the Regional
               Loss Prevention Manager for Barnes and Noble College Book
               Stores. Ruggiero told me the following. The WSU Book Store
               hired Victor A. Gomez in July of 2014. Beginning in early 2015,
               Gomez has admitted to stealing merchandise and cash from the
               WSU Book Store. Recently, Leslie Martin noticed that there was
               money discrepancies between the tills and the cash in the money
               safe. Ruggiero stated on 11/25/2015 Martin noticed a $110.00
               discrepancy with the money in the safe so she reviewed the
               video surveillance tape on the safe and noticed when Gomez
               would access the safe, he would make numerous furtive movements
               similar with trying to hide him taking cash from the safe.
               Martin continued to monitor the safe, cash counting, and video
               surveillance tapes and noticed that regularly there were
               discrepancies between the cash recorded in the tills and the
               amount of cash transferred to the safe. She watched the
               surveillance tapes and noticed regular furtive movements by
               Gomez nearly every time he accessed the safe. Martin documented
               the differences in the computer and the cash in the safe for
               the following dates. 11/25/15: 1- 20 dollar bill and 18- 5
               dollar bills from two different stacks = $110.00 loss 12/1/15:
               9 - $5 dollar bills= $45.00 loss 12/3/15: 3 - $5 dollar bills,
               and 2- 10 dollar bills from two different stacks = $35.00 loss
               12/7/15: 3- $5 dollar bills = $15.00 loss 12/8/15: 3- $10
               dollar bills = $30.00 Loss 12/11/15: 6- $5 dollar bills =
               $30.00 Loss 12/14/15: 2- $5 dollar bills = $10.00 Loss Gomez
               admitted to stealing a Nike Dri Fit WSU hooded sweatshirt and a
               Nike WSU Cougar t shirt. Ruggiero valued the two combined
               clothing items at approximately $120.00. Gomez admitted to
               stealing three Rock Star energy drinks from the convenience
               store. He admitted to taking several "penny" overstock items
               including pillows, teddy bears and purses which he shipped from
               the Bookie to his mother and to himself. Ruggiero provided me
               with a signed statement that he stated Gomez wrote admitting to
               the thefts. I reviewed Gomez' statement and Ruggiero told me
