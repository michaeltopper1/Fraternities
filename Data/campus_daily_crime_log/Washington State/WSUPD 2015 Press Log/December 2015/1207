               Hall. Unable to locate. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               2. NARRATIVE: On 12-07-2015 at about 1035 hrs I was dispatched
               to a report of a suspicious person near Regents Hall, located
               at 1580 NE Cougar Way. The complainant, Kevin J. Sanduist (DOB
               10-10-1995), reported that he had observed a suspicious male
               near Regents Hall and Global Scholars Hall. The male was moving
               around dumpsters located outside both buildings. Sanduist
               reported that the suspicious male was also observed leaving the
               market in Global Scholars Hall. Sanduist stated that he
               confronted the suspicious male, and the male ran away. Sanduist
               described the male as: white male; dark hair; 5-09; black
               jacket with red lining; tan hat on backwards. I checked the
               area but did not locate the male. Nothing in the area appeared
               to be out of place, and I did not observe any property damage.
               The Pullman Police Department (PPD) was later dispatched to a
               report of a male moving dumpsters out onto the roadway at East
               Main Street and Kamiaken Street. The PPD officers contacted and
               arrested a subject who was responsible for moving the
               dumpsters. The PPD incident might be related to this case. For
               more information, see case #15-P12002. No further action at
               this time. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under penalty of

               hall with a medical issue. Assisted medics with the patient.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 12-07-
               15 at about 1347 hours I heard Pullman Fire being dispatched to
               an unconscious person at Orton hall in the 11th floor bathroom.
               The patient had apparently had a seizure and was now
               unconscious in a pool of blood on the bathroom floor. Upon my
               arrival I contacted Xavier L. Henderson. He was with the
               unconscious female, later identified as Emily A. Davis.
               Henderson said that Davis is a friend of his who was visiting
               from out of town. He said she had gone to the bathroom and he
               noticed she had been gone for awhile. He told me when he went
               looking for Emily he found her in the bathroom, with the light
               off, laying unconscious in a pool of blood. He told me that she
               has had seizures in the past and believes she was on medication
               for them. I could see that Emily was breathing. I tried to wake
               her up, without success. Once medics arrived I assisted them
               with getting Emily onto the gurney since she had started to
               wake up and was being aggressive. Emily is not a student.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 7th day of December, 2015, in

               messages. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 12-07-15 at about 1445 hours I was dispatched to the report
               of harassment. Whitcom advised the RP, Marit B. Thorkildsen,
               was requesting phone contact regarding text messages she has
               been receiving. I called Marit at the number provided and asked
               her what was going on. She told me the following; she said that
               about 15 minutes ago she received several text messages from an
               unknown phone number. She sent me screen shots of the text
               conversation that went as follows; 509-265-7273: Hey Marit
               Marit: Who is this? 509-265-7273: I have pictures of you I
               think you should know about Marit: Who is this? 509-265-7273: A
               friend of yours sent them to me Marit: Who? What pictures? 509-
               265-7273: Nudes Marit: Who did you get them from 509-265-7273:
               Can't tell you that Marit: Who are you 509-265-7273: Tell your
               friend anna that I stopped texting you or these pics go out
               Marit: Who are you? 509-265-7273: Did yo do it? and I will tell
               you in my own time Marit: I'm blocking you and I will give your
               number to authorities. This isn't okay. **end of conversation.
               at this point Marit advised that she blocked the phone number**
               Marit said she has no idea who the phone number belongs to and
               found it odd that they referenced her roommate "anna". Marit
               told me she does not appreciate these text messages and said
               they "freak me out". I asked Marit if there are nude photos of
               her that they could possibly have. She said the only nude
               photos she has ever taken she sent to her boyfriend, who "would
               never do something like this". Marit did not identify her
               boyfriend and does not believe he is involved. I asked Marit if
               the messages have continued and she said no, not since she
               blocked the phone number. I asked her what she would like me to
               do. She said she wanted me to contact the phone number and tell
               the person to stop contacting her. I told her I would try, but
               it was unlikely anybody would answer the phone. I gave Marit my
               email and asked her to send screen shots of the text
               conversation, which she later did. The file is attached to this
               case. I asked Marit to contact me to let me know if the
               messages continue from this number or any others he does not
               recognize. I ended my call with Marit and called the phone
               number she provided. It rang several times then made a loud
               sound. There was no answering machine or voicemail message. I
               believe this is some type of extortion scam, much like the
               report from case 15-W5847. No suspects or leads. I certify and

               sedan hit a parked silver truck on the 2nd floor of the CUE
               parking garage and left the area. I was unable to locate the
               truck and we did not receive a call from the truck owner.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 12-07-
               15, at approximately 1510 hours, Karissa B. Garcia (09-04-87)
               called Whitcom stating she had just witnessed a black sedan
               (WA/AUM711) hit a parked truck on the 2nd floor of the CUE
               parking garage. Garcia told Whitcom the black sedan was backing
               toward a parking space when it his a silver Toyota truck. The
               black sedan was last seen turning right onto Stadium Way from

               responded to the 2nd floor of the CUE parking garage to take
               photos of the silver Toyota truck, but was unable to locate it.
               I called Garcia and asked her to describe the vehicle and where
               she saw it parked. She said it was an older silver Toyota truck
               with a single cab. She said it was parked close to the area
               where you can pay to park on the 2nd floor. I was still unable
               to locate the described truck. While I was in the CUE parking
               garage, I heard a Pullman Police Officer (480) advise Whitcom
               he located the black sedan at 1445 NW Turner Drive. The
               registered owner of the car, Arig N. Aboulenein (06-24-92)
               lives at 1445 NW Turner Drive; apartment 7. I took photographs
               of the damage to the vehicle (small paint scrapes to the rear
               of the driver's side wheel well area and tire), then responded
               to apartment 7. I knocked on the door and a female; later
               identified as Arig Aboulenein, opened the door. I explained who
               I was and why I was there. She said she had just left the CUE
               parking garage. She said she thought she heard something when
               she was backing up, but did not think she hit another vehicle.
               I asked her if she would accompany me to her car so I could
               show her the damage. I estimate the cost to repair the damage
               to her car to be approximately $20.00. While we were walking to
               her car I educated her on what she was responsible for if she
               actually hit another vehicle. I told her it was always a good
               idea to call the Police, but she was required to leave a note
               on the other vehicle with her name and contact information. She
               said she was not aware of that and again said she did not
               realize she hit another vehicle. I told her I could not locate
               the victim vehicle at this time and had not received a phone
               call from it's owner so I was only going to give her a warning
               at this point. I told her if I was able to locate the victim

               suspicious person in the Compton Union Building walking back
               and forth. Subject said he last saw the male about 15 minutes
               before calling the police. Officers arrived on scene, but were

               hours I was dispatched to the report of a suspicious person in
               the Compton Union Building (CUB), located at 1500 NE Terrell
               Mall. Dispatch advised the complainant, Liam A. Cosme (DOB 03-
               31-96), saw "an Arabian looking male" walking very slowly
               through the CUB. He was last seeb about 15 minutes before
               calling Dispatch. The male had a beard, was wearing jeans, and
               a black leather jacket with a backpack. Dispatch advised the
               male was in the lounge area with the TV. Ofc. Whitman and I
               arrived on scene. We walked around the CUB, but did not see
               anyone matching the males description. I talked to several
               students, but nobody saw the male or anyone who appeared
               suspicious. Ofc. Whitman spoke with the CUB front desk staff,
               but none of them had seen the male. I returned to the station
               to call Cosme. I asked Cosme what was suspicious about the
               male, and he said he was walking very slowly with his left hand
               in his leather jacket pocket the entire time. I asked Cosme how
               old he thought the male was, and he said in his 50's. Cosme
               said the male had a smirk on his face while he was walking. He
               said he was walking back in forth in the study lounge area, by
               the big screen TV, all the way back to the pool tables. He
               mentioned that the male probably walked back and forth about
               three times in five minutes. Cosme told me he saw the male
               around 2330 hours, but he left the CUB because he was scared.
               Cosme told me he is probably just being paranoid, but he would
               rather call and report something than ignore it and have
               something happen. I thanked him for calling. Ofc. Whitman and I
               were unable to locate the male. We cleared the area. No further
               action. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 8th day of December, 2015, in Pullman,

               Officer talked with both parties and told them not to

               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 12-07-15 at
               approximately 2235 hours I was dispatched to the report of an
               harassment. Dispatch advised the complainant, Lorne P. Mongeau
               (DOB 07-12-92), was being harassed via Facebook on a closed
               page for the Pullman Ride Share. Dispatch said an individual is
               posting things about him to the page that are not true. I
               contacted Mongeau at his residence in Honors Hall #245A,
               located at 600 NE Spokane St. I asked Mongeau what was going
               on, and he said he was being threatened on Facebook. He said he
               got into an argument with Adrian C. Jenkins (DOB 03-09-97) over
               Facebook messages and a Facebook post on the page for the
               Pullman Ride Share. Mongeau said he gave Jenkins a ride to the
               west side of the state for break in the past, but was unable to
               provide him with a ride home because of a family emergency.
               Mongeau said Jenkins had been upset with him for that and they
               had a couple of "heated arguments" over the phone a long time
               ago. Mongeau said Jenkins has contacted him again for a ride
               recently, but cancelled at the last minute and told him that he
               no longer needed a ride. Mongeau said Jenkins messaged him
               tonight on Facebook 12-07-15 at about 2154 hours asking for a
               ride to the west side over break. Mongeau replied to him "Nah I
               don't do biz with flakes". They began to argue with who bailed
               on who in the past. Jenkins told Mongeau that he was "going to
               make sure the Pullman 2 Seattle ride share page knows how you
               treated me". Mongeau then replied "since you have directly
               threatened me I will be contacting the pullman police. This is
               harassment". Jenkins posted the following on the ride share
               page: "BEWARE OF LORNE MONTAGEU!! First off, he left me and my
               two friends stranded in bellevue with no valid excuse except
               that he forgot, then on another occasion, I messaged him about
               a ride and shortly after I let him know I wouldn't need the
               ride. Then, today I asked him for another ride and he said I
               don't deal with flakes and tried to say I was threatening him
               for posting this. Are you kidding me?! I'm just trying to
               lookout for my fellow cougs! I took photographs of the Facebook
               messages along with the post, and they were later uploaded into
               Spillman. This post had many different comments between

               Montageu, Jenkins, and other various users. There were no
               actual threats made. However, Montageu said the post made him
               look bad, and that he makes money giving people rides from the
               page. He was afraid this post would hurt him from getting
               customers. I told Montageu to stop replying to Jenkins and that
               he needed to block him on Facebook. Montageu told me he would.
               I cleared the scene. I called Perkins on the phone at about
               2330 hours. I asked him what was going on between him and
               Montageu. He said him in Montageu have had issues in the past
               over carpooling, but he tried to see if he could ride with him
               over the upcoming break and an argument broke out. Perkins told
               me he was sorry the police had to get involved and that he
               would delete the Facebook post. I told Perkins not to contact
               Montageu in the future, and he said he would not. I called
               Montageu to tell him that Perkins would not be contacting him.
               Montageu told me the Facebook post was no longer there, and had
               been deleted. He thanked me for my help. No further action. My
               Vievu camera was activated, and the video was later downloaded
               into the permanent digital evidence folder. No further action.

               Marijuana NARRATIVE: On 12/08/15 at about 0041 hours I was
               dispatched to a drugs call at Stephenson South room 929. The
               RED, Brittany Griffin, reported a faint odor coming from the
               room and there were possibly three subjects inside. Officer
               Tiengo and I arrived and talked to Griffin on the ninth floor.
               She said two of her RA's were on the elevator with some of the
               subjects that went into room 929. They smelled an odor of
               marijuana coming from them and they contacted Griffin. Griffin
               said when she arrived she could smell a faint odor of marijuana
               coming from the door. I smelled the door jam and could smell
               the odor of marijuana. I knocked on the door and Lindsey Vest
               answered the door. I asked if anyone else was in the room.
               Three other individuals came to the door. I asked if they knew
               why I was there, they said they did not. I asked them if any of
               them were over 21, and they all said they were not. I asked if
               any of them had a medical marijuana card, they said they did
               not. I asked again if they knew why I was there, they again
               said they did not know. I asked if there was any marijuana in
               the room. Vest said there was not, she said they had gone
               outside to smoke. I explained they were being warned and I was
               forwarding my report to student conduct. I then asked again if
               there was any marijuana or other drug paraphernalia in the
               room. Vest retrieved a glass pipe from the room that had
               marijuana residue in it. I explained it was hard for me to
               believe I contacted them after they had just smoked the last of
               there marijuana. Vest said they had and got the baggy she had
               the marijuana in. I could see small flakes of marijuana in the
               baggy. I asked if they had been contacted about drugs or
               alcohol on campus before and they all had been. Ferrulli said
               he had been to a student conduct hearing and his case was
               "overturned easily". Harvey said his was overturned because he
               does not smoke marijuana. I escorted Vest to the dumpster and
               she disposed of the glass pipe and the baggy. All four warned.
               Forward to student conduct. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 8th day of December,
