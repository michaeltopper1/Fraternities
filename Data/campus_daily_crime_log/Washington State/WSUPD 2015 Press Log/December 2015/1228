    Time Occurred between: 10:00:00 12/27/15 - 06:30:00 12/28/15

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Olmstead/339 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W6629 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched to a
               report of a broken window in the Veterinary and Biomedical
               Research Building. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 12-28-2015 at about 0808 hrs I was dispatched to
               a report of property damage in the Veterinary and Biomedical
               Research Building, located at 1815 NE Ferdinands Lane. Dispatch
               advised that WSU Facilities Operations personnel had located a
               broken window inside the building near room #120. I arrived on
               scene and located the damaged window. The wall that separates
               the hallway from room #120 is composed of several large glass
               window panes. The glass panes reach from the ceiling to the
               floor and are partitioned into rectangular sections. I saw that
               one rectangular window pane was fractured with numerous cracks
               throughout the glass. The damaged window was still in place,
               and none of the broken glass had fallen to the floor. I checked
               the surface of the glass and did not locate any point of
               impact. Taking into consideration this is a large glass window
               pane in a new building, and the fact that new buildings often
               shift and settle over time, it appears that the window was most
               likely damaged through some type of force or movement within
               the structure of the building. The broken window was not the
               result of a criminal act. The damage occurred sometime between
               1000 hrs on 12-27-2015 and 0630 hrs on 12-28-2015 and is
               estimated to be $1000.00. I photographed the scene, and the
               photographs were downloaded into Spillman and attached to this
               case. No further action at this time. Olmstead/339 I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.
