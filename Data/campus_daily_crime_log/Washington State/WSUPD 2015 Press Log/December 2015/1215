               non-injury, non-reportable collision. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 12-15-15 at about 1159 hours I
               was dispatched to a non-injury collision on Olsen St near
               Kamiaken St. Whitcom advised that the driver of a truck backed
               into a parked car. I was asked to handle the collision because
               the driver of the truck was an off duty PPD Officer. I arrived
               on scene and contacted Shane E. Emerson and Kelly Anderson.
               Emerson told me that he was backing up and bumped into the car
               that was parked behind him. He said that was no damage to his
               truck. I asked Anderson what happened. She said her car was
               parked, unoccupied and that Emerson told her what happened. She
               showed me minor damage to her front license plate cover, which
               appeared to have been bent. There was no other damage to either
               vehicle. While I was taking pictures I heard Emerson tell
               Anderson that he would buy her a new license plate cover. I
               provided Anderson with the case number and Emerson's contact
               information. The photos were later downloaded to Spillman
               Files. Emerson was warned for improper backing. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 15th day of December, 2015, in Pullman,

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: JAK/333 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W6461 SYNOPSIS: Terrell Library staff
               reported a pair of "Beats" headphones were taken from their
               "Lost & Found" area. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 12-15-15, Susan Shipman called Whitcom wanting to
               report a pair of "Beats" headphones as missing from their "Lost
               & Found" area. Shipman said the headphones were kept in a
               drawer; located behind the circulation desk, which is supposed
               to be kept locked. It had been reported that staff members were
               having trouble shutting the drawer as of late so she is not
               sure it was actually locked. The headphones were described as
               being bleu "Beats" with a red cord. They were logged as turned
               in to the "Lost & Found" by Tia Goodspeed on 12-10-15. The log
               says the headphones were found sometime between 1100 and 1300
               on 12-10-15, but does not say who found them. On 12-11-15,
               between 0900 and 1000 hours, a person came by the circulation
               desk to ask if his "Beats" had been turned in. He described the
               "Beats" as being blue with a red cord. Delores Fuga looked in
               the "Lost & Found" drawer and could not locate them. She told
               the male he should go to the Police Department to see if they
               had been transferred there. The male said he checked with the
               Police Department and they had not been turned in there. The
               male left a voice message of Shipman's phone saying his name
               was Jenson Marrow and said the headphones cost $250.00. He said
               he doesn't care if someone was just using the headphones, he
               just wants them back. Shipman said there were 42 employees who
               were working on December 10th and 11th who have access to the
               "Lost & Found" area even if the drawer was locked. She said if
               the drawer was locked, quite a few more people could have
               accessed the drawer. She has sent out an e-mail to her
               employees asking if anyone has seen or borrowed the headphones.
               She asked me not to come over and begin interviewing everyone
               who had access to the "Lost & Found" at this point. I asked her
               to keep me informed. Investigation continues. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               Garza/082797 2. NARRATIVE: On 12/15/15 at about 2130 hours I
               was dispatched to a harassment call at Coman Hall. The
               reporting party, Alyssa Griffin, is an RA at Coman Hall and one
               of her residents report an incident to her that occurred the
               night before. The resident, Megan Bickford, reported that two
               girls from her floor entered her room and "shoved a pretzel
               into her butt". I responded and talked to Griffin. She
               explained that Bickford talked to her about the incident that
               occurred the night before. She said Bickford told her that
               while she was asleep in her dorm she felt a pretzel being
               inserted into her butt. She awoke and say two girls she knew
               leaving her room. Bickford identified the girls as Kaylee
               Fontes, and Caitlin Garza. I asked Griffin was at the dorm so
               that I could talk to her. Griffin said she was and she said she
               told Bickford she was talking to the police about the incident.
               I asked Griffin if she thought she would talk to me and she
               said she thought she would. I asked Griffin if she would ask
               her to come down to the Scott Hall RED office so we could talk
               without distractions. Griffin went and talked to Bickford.
               Bickford and Griffin came down to the RED office in Scott Hall.
               Griffin and the on call RED left to deal with another
               situation. WSU PD intern Scheetz was also present during the
               interview. I asked Bickford what happened. She explained that
               she went to sleep early because she had a final in the morning.
               Bickford said she normally sleeps without pants on. She said
               Fontes and Garza have often teased her or played pranks on her
               throughout the semester. Bickford said while she was asleep but
               then partially awoken by sounds around her. She then said "I
               felt a pretzel going up my butt". Bickford immediately turned
               around and saw the two girls leaving her room. She said she put
               on pants and went to confront them but they did not answer
               their door. Bickford said her roommate was in the room when
               this occurred. I asked if her roommate saw anything, Bickford
               said their room is dark and did not know if she saw anything.
               Bickford said her roommate, Katie Buchanan, said what they did
               "isn't okay". Bickford also said she heard Buchanan say "hey,
               stop messing with her". I asked if the door to her room was
               locked. Bickford said she typically likes to have the door
               locked, but her roommate leaves it unlocked while she is up.
               Bickford and Buchanan came to the agreement that Buchanan would

               lock the door when she goes to bed. Bickford said Buchanan was
               awake when the incident occurred. I asked Bickford what kind of
               pretzel it was. She said she thought it was a stick pretzel,
               she described it as a "crunchy round small". I asked Bickford
               where she felt it go. She said I "felt it go up my butthole". I
               asked Bickford about the incidents from earlier in the
               semester. She said they were small things like "moving her
               toothpaste" or taking pictures of her while she was sleeping or
               "messing with her while she was sleeping" like "shaking" her or
               "throwing stuff" at her while she was asleep. I gave Bickford
               my card with the case number on it, I also explained there were
               phone numbers on my card for services to call if she needed
               anything. I gave a her a business card for Alternatives to
               Violence of the Palouse, and a card from the Crime Victim
               Service Center. I gave her the Information for Domestic
               Violence and Sexual Assault Crime Victims packet. Officer Boyd
               and I then went to speak with Garza and Fontes. I knocked on
               their dorm room door, room 317, Coman Hall. Garza answered the
               door. I asked if she would step into the hallway and talk to
               me. She said she would and stepped into the hallway. I read
               Garza Miranda warning from my department issued card. I asked
               if she understood her rights and she said she did. I asked if
               she wanted to talk to me. Garza said she wanted to know what
               this was about first. I said I was there because of what
               happened the night before. Garza said she heard that Bickford
               was accusing her of sexual assault, and she did not understand
               where that was coming from. I asked if she wanted to explain
               what happened last night. Garza said she did not want to talk
               to me right now because she was shocked by the accusation and
               "nothing even happened". She again asked what I was there
               about. I told her I was there to talk to her about her going
               into someone else room and inserting a pretzel into their butt.
               Garza said "okay, that's not it" and she was told she sexually
               assaulted someone. Garza used air quotes with her hands as she
               said "sexually assaulted someone". She said she did not
               sexually assault someone at anytime. She then said she wished
               to not talk. Officer Boyd talked to Fontes while I was talking
               to Garza. As Garza stated she did not want to talk to me
               anymore and returned to her room Officer Boyd was done talking
               to Fontes. I talked to Officer Boyd. He said Fontes told him
               she was at the door and Garza was inside the room when the
               incident occurred. She said she thought Garza only threw the
               pretzel at Bickford's butt. I went back and talked Bickford, I
               explained that I had talked to Garza and Fontes. I explained
               they said they had only thrown the pretzel at her butt.
               Bickford again stated she felt the pretzel go into her butt,
               and that is when she woke up and saw them leaving. I asked if
               Bickford if she had Buchanan's cell phone number so I could
               talk to her. Bickford was not sure because she thinks she
               changed it recently. I went to my vehicle and attempted to call
               Buchanan. Buchanan did not answer, the voicemail message was a
               female voice stating it was Katie's phone. I left a message for
               her to call me. I returned and talked to Bickford and Griffin.
               I explained I would be gathering more information and then most
               likely be forwarding charges to the prosecutor. I asked if she

               would be interested in going to the hospital for an examine,
               she said no. I discussed what would be the best option for
               living arrangements since they all live on the same floor.
               Griffin called the RED on duty. I talked to the RED on the
               phone about what options were available. I explained those
               options to Bickford. She decided she wanted to stay in her
               room. I explained that she could call if there were any
               problems and those options would be available. Investigation
               continues. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true

               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W6473 SYNOPSIS: Report of a group
               of males throwing snowballs at Goldsworthy Hall. Males ran off
               from in front of Gannon Hall as I arrived. Unable to locate,
               nothing further. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 12/16/15 at about 0359 hours I was dispatched to
               a reckless endangerment call at Goldsworthy Hall. A report of 4
               to 5 males throwing snowballs at windows of Goldsworthy Hall.
               As I approached I saw several males run into Gannon Hall. I
               talked to several people, males and females in a group, who
               said those were the ones throwing snowballs at Gannon Hall. The
               people I spoke with were being quiet and respectful. One male I
               spoke with pointed out several snowball marks on the side of
               Gannon Hall that appeared to be targeting the third and fourth
               floor windows on the Northeast side of the building. No one I
               spoke to knew the males who threw the snowballs. As I was
               reading through the call notes at the office the original
               reporting party said there were also 3 to 4 foot tall snowballs
               left in the roadway. I did not see them when I was at Gannon
               Hall. I radioed Officer Boyd who was still on the road. He said
               he could see the remnants of the larger snowballs but nothing
               that would cause a hazard at this time. At about 0436 hours the
               reporting party called and stated the males were back outside
               Goldsworthy throwing snowballs. I again checked the area and
               talked to a couple of groups but was unable to locate the
               subjects. No suspects or leads at this time. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 16th day of December, 2015, in Pullman,

               On 12/16/15 at about 0420 hrs Dispatch advised of a noise
               complaint at Rogers Hall. The complaint was regarding a group
               of students outside playing in the snow. This was the second
               such complaint in 30 minutes. I responded and contacted a group
               of students, who were not identified. I advised them of the
               noise complaint and suggested they go inside to avoid receiving
               a noise infraction. They dispersed and went back inside.

               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 16 day of December, 2015, in
