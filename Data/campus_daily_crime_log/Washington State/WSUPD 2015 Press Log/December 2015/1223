    Narrative: RVWD: 316 OFC: JAK/333 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W6604 SYNOPSIS: A WSU Parking Permit was
               stolen out of an unlocked vehicle which was parked in the
               Johnson Hall parking lot on the WSU campus. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 12-23-15, John K.
               Fellman (11-26-52) called Whitcom wanting to report his parking
               permit had been stolen from his car. I contacted Fellman and
               asked him to tell me what happened. He said he parked his
               Toyota Camry (ID/1LB0657) in the Johnson Hall parking lot on
               11-21-15, at approximately 0840 hours. He said he remembered
               hanging his WSU Parking Permit from his rear view mirror and
               attaching it to the windshield via a suction cup just prior to
               driving to Pullman. He said he did not lock the doors of his
               Camry. On 12-22-15, at approximately 0800 hours, Fellman
               realized the parking permit was no longer hanging from his rear
               view mirror. He searched the car, but was unable to find it. He
               believes someone must have stolen it from his car. The Parking
               Permit was issued by WSU. It was a Green Permit (GN 15151) and
               had his name written on the back of it in black Sharpie. The
               current value of the permit is $357.69. I gave Fellman a Police
               Case Number and told him WSU Parking Services will need this in
               order to issue him a new Permit. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               23rd day of December, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W6605 SYNOPSIS: A WSU Housing and
               Maintenance grounds employee was removing snow in the Chinook
               Village apartments parking lot. The John Deer skid steer he was
               using collided with a parked car causing damage to its
               passenger side front door area. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 12-23-15, at approximately
               1408 hours, Roy A. Fye (08-24-55) was driving a John Deer skid
               steer tractor, removing snow from the Chinook Apartments
               parking lot. While removing snow, his skid steer shifted and
               struck a parked car (WA/453ZZI). The skid steer punctured the
               passenger side front door of the car. I estimate the damage to
               the car to be approximately $750.00. I took photos of the
               damage to the parked car and uploaded them into the "Files"
               section of the case. I was able to determine the vehicle is
               registered to Carlos A. Contreras (11-11-87). Contreras lives
               in the Chinook Village apartments; B9. I knocked on the
               apartment door, but received no answer. I found an e-mail
               address for Contreras (carlos.contreras@wsu.edu) and sent him a
               message asking him to contact me when he returns to Pullman.
               Awaiting contact from Contreras. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 24th day of
               December, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               WITNESS(ES): None NARRATIVE: On 12/23/15 at approximately 1700
               hours I was dispatched to an agency assist for a collision on
               SR 270 at MP 8. I responded and located the collision at
               approximately MP 6.5. There were two vehicles on the south side
               shoulder of the east bound lane of travel. I spoke with the
               drivers, Semel Muniz & Jedidiah Adams. Both said they were not
               injured and were exchanging information. Adams said he pulled
               out of his residence (6202 SR 270), which is located on the
               north side of the roadway. Adams said he pulled into the center
               turn lane and as he was accelerating he began to slide and went
               into the east bound lane of travel closest to the center lane.
               Adams said he was struck by Muniz. Muniz gave the same account
               of the collision. Muniz said he began to slow down and
               attempted to change lanes to avoid the collision, but struck
               the back passenger side of Adams vehicle with the front
               driver's side of his vehicle. Muniz said he was going
               approximately 30 MPH when the collision occurred. I completed
               an exchange of information and provided both driver's with a
               copy. Both vehicles were able to drive from the scene. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under

               Warned Trespassing NARRATIVE: On 12/23/15 around 1924 hrs I was
               dispatched to a report of individuals refusing to leave the
               basketball courts in PEB after being contacted. Sgt Kuhrt and I
               responded and upon our arrival contacted the reporting party,
               later identified as John J Berney (02/03/52), and told the
               following. According to Berney, another custodian who was not
               identified, had contacted a group of individuals on the
               basketball court in room 144 of the PEB. The individuals had
               told this custodian they had permission and had refused to
               leave. Kuhrt and I went to room 144 and found the above listed
               individuals in the gym and playing basketball. We asked who had
               given them permission and an individual, later identified as
               Joseph M Lang (05/31/96), had explained his father, David G
               Lang (01/23/69), had told them it was ok to be in the gym and
               play. Kuhrt spoke with David Lang while I went and spoke with
               Berney. Upon speaking with Berney I explained what I had been
               told by Joseph Lang. He told me he was fine with them remaining
               in the building and playing basketball as long as nobody else
               showed up. I returned to where Kuhrt and the other individuals
               were and was told David Lang had not authorized them to play on
               the courts as Joseph had led us to believe. Around this point
               all individuals were identified and I asked Joseph to contact
               his father so I could speak with him. Upon speaking with David
               I explained what Berney had told me and was told he would
               authorize them to play one more game before leaving. After
               concluding my conversation with David I spoke with Joseph and
               explained they could remain and play one more game if they
               wished. I went on to tell them they had until 2030 hrs to play
               and if they were asked to leave they needed to do so. Joseph
               told me he understood and would not cause any problems. All
               individuals contacted were warned and Kuhrt and I cleared after
               speaking the custodial staff. Nothing further. I certify and
