               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 12-02-15 at
               approximately 1016 hours, I contacted the RP, Ashley Heilman,
               in the WSU PD lobby regarding an injury accident. Ashley stated
               she had been crossing Troy Lane near the stairs leading down
               the hill when she heard a car sliding. She said she was then
               struck from behind by the vehicle, went onto the hood, and then
               landed on her feet. She stated at the time she didn't think she
               was injured. She stated she had been rushing to work and was a
               little in shock. She described the vehicle as a small suv and
               stated the driver was an older male. She stated he stopped and
               asked if she was okay and she said yes. They did not exchange
               any information and she did not have any further description of
               the vehicle or driver. I asked her how fast she thought the
               vehicle had been going when it hit her and she said not very as
               it didn't throw her or cause her to fall. I asked Ashley if she
               was injured and she stated her back was sore. I asked her if
               she wanted medical attention and she said no. I asked her if
               she wanted a ride to Student Health and she said she was fine
               walking. I advised her it would be a good idea to be seen by a
               doctor to make sure she was okay and she stated she would
               probably go to Student Health. I gave her my business card and
               advised her to contact me if she remembered any further
               details. She stated she would. We also discussed reporting
               accidents immediately and she stated she understood. We
               concluded our conversation and she left. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W6154 SYNOPSIS: Report of subjects
               throwing snowballs and one hit a vehicle. Three subjects were
               contacted and warned. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.

               Atoa/04-04-96 warned throwing snowballs and false statement
               NARRATIVE: On 12-02-15 at approximately 1608 hours, I was
               advised of three subjects throwing snowballs in the parking lot
               near Stephenson East. The RP stated one of the subjects threw a
               snowball at his vehicle. He was currently driving to Moscow and
               was unsure if there was damage. I responded to the area and
               found three subjects walking across Nevada at the Stephenson
               Complex throwing snowballs at each other. I contacted the three
               and they stated they had been throwing them in the parking lot
               at each other and one of the snowballs had hit a vehicle. They
               stated they were just goofing off and didn't mean to hit the
               car. I asked the three for identification and one of them
               provided a WA Driver's License. He was identified as Shawn M.
               Smith. The other two identified themselves as Ben Faalavaau and
               Jose M. King. I later determined Ben's name is actually
               Alofagia Benjamin Faalavaau. I was unable to get a return for
               King. I had advised him to not lie to me about his information
               and he could be charged with providing false information if he
               did. He stated he understood. I advised the three I had
               received a complaint and advised them I was waiting to hear if
               there was damage to the vehicle. King stated he was the one who
               threw the snowball which hit the vehicle. King and Smith stated
               they did not attend WSU and were here visiting Ben. I advised
               Ben he was responsible for the behavior of his guests. I
               cleared. I later called Ben and advised him I needed King to
               provide his correct information. I told Ben I would give King
               one more chance to provide his correct name and date of birth.
               Ben stated he would contact King and have him call me with his
               correct information. I later called the RP who stated he did
               not see any damage to his vehicle. I did not get Park's vehicle
               information since there was no damage. At approximately 1850
               hours, I received a phone call from King. He stated he had lied
               to me because he knew he had a warrant and was scared. He
               stated his name was Nolan Felix Atoa/04-04-96. His return did
               show a warrant but it was for Spokane County only. I talked
               with Atoa about the false statement as well as needing to take
               care of his warrant. I advised him to contact the PA's office
               in Spokane County to discuss taking care of it. He stated he

               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 120215 at
               approximately 1700 hours I was dispatched to the theft of a
               wallet from room 606 in Goldsworthy Hall. I called the
               RP/Victim, Yzette Cerdafarias (031296), who told me she had
               left her wallet on her desk on 112015 at approximately 1100
               hours. When she returned on 112915 at approximately 2200 hours
               the wallet was gone. Several of her roommate's posters were
               down as well. Nothing else was taken. Cerdafarias said it was a
               black Fossil wallet with her WADL, US Bank Visa Debit, Card,
               unknown small amount of cash, and a medical insurance card.
               Cerdafarias did not suspect anyone and her roommate had left
               with her and returned with her from Thanksgiving break. She
               said she had heard that some people had had things returned to
               them after break. This was a non-specific rumor. I told her I
               would contact Hall Staff to see if things had been taken
               incorrectly for safe keeping. I contacted RED Brittany Griffin
               who stated no one should have taken anything during the break
               room check. She would let me know if anything was taken for
               safe keeping. I then called Cerdafarias back and informed her
               that it was doubtful that Hall Staff had taken anything for
               safe keeping. She confirmed that the heat had not been left on
               in her room which may explain the posters coming off the wall.
               She also confirmed that her door had been locked when she left
               and returned. Case closed pending developments. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               2nd day of December, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               Poss. Stolen Property 3rd. 2. NARRATIVE: On 120215 at
               approximately 1900 hours I was finishing assisting another
               subject with a vehicle lockout on N Fairway near the baseball
               stadium when I was approached by Rachel M. Garcia ((070797) and
               her unidentified friend. Garcia had lost her phone sometime
               around 1630 hours in the area of the Stephenson Complex. She
               thought her phone may have fallen out of her pocket. Garcia had
               used a tracking application to find her phone in the vicinity
               of the parking spots on the north side of NE N Fairway Rd near
               the Grey Lot. On her friend's phone we tracked the signal to a
               white pickup truck (ID/E106535). I shined my flashlight into
               the cab and a phone was sitting in the open on the seat. We
               called Garcia's phone and the phone in the cab rang. Garcia was
               positive it was her phone and her friend's phone number showing
               on the screen. She noted that her friend's name should have
               shown on the screen so she was worried that the phone had been
               wiped. Sgt. Daniels was at the station and I had her locate
               someone associated with the vehicle as Idaho DOL was down. She
               located Juan J. Torres (120194) via AIMS and Spillman. I first
               attempted calling him and then tried locating him remotely in
               the Beasley and the SRC. I tried calling him again on his phone
               and he answered. He agreed to meet me at his vehicle as he was
               working in Beasley. Torres met me at his vehicle and thought I
               wanted to speak with me regarding a parking issue. I asked him
               about the phone in his cab. He said he found it over by Rogers
               Hall and planned on calling us but came to work at Beasley
               without doing so. He said he did not have out number to call
               us. I confirmed that he had a smartphone with access to the
               internet to locate our phone number. He did. Torres retrieved
               the phone and gave it to me. He was polite and respectful. I
               told him at a minimum I would refer him to Student Conduct but
               if I found the phone had been wiped then I would forward
               charges to the prosecutor. He said he understood and went back
               to work. I took the phone to Garcia who I had waiting in my
               patrol car. She confirmed it was her phone by logging in and
               found the phone had not been wiped. She was not sure why her
               friends name was not showing up but I think it was due to her
               remotely locking the phone. She valued the phone at $700. I
               explained to Garcia I planned on only referring Torres to

               Stephenson South as her friend had left a while before. I
               cleared. Nothing follows. I certify and declare under penalty

               hours, I contacted Karen Fischer from Dean of Students
               regarding a student who had questions about his trespass
               admonition. The student, Ricky Martin, was concerned about
               walking to his residence hall at Gannon. According to the
               trespass paperwork he is trespassed from Southside Dining,
               Flix, and Stephenson South Hall, "Including all buildings,
               sidewalks, breezeways, courtyards, access roads and parking
               lots and any other buildings associated with Stephenson South
               Hall, Southside Dining and Flix Cafe." Ricky was concerned
               about getting to Gannon without walking on the sidewalk. I
               explained to him as long as he does not go to the buildings
               listed and the immediate sidewalks of those areas he would be
               fine. I explained to not go on the Southside Cafe/Flix side of
               Gannon/Golds. He stated he understood. Fischer also felt the
               clarification was sufficient. We concluded our phone call. I
               will address the wording of the order in the morning with
               Residence Life who issued the order. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               at approximately 2104 hours I was dispatched to the report of
               the odor of marijuana in the vicinity of room 204. I responded
               and detected a strong odor coming from the collection of rooms
               the are contained in one wing, including room 204. The smell
               seemed strongest near room 204. Hall Staff stated they had
               smelled the odor for several days but could not pinpoint it.
               They had walked behind Mia H. Freidenburg (102596) who was the
               resident of room 204 and detected the odor. I knocked on the
               door of room 204 and Calandra E. Moore answered the door. I
               asked if Freidenburg was home too and she confirmed she was. I
               confirmed with both of them that they were under 21 and did not
               have a medicinal marijuana card. I asked if they knew why I was
               there and did not know. I explained that it was due to the
               strong odor of marijuana. I noted that Freidenburg had been
               sitting next to an open window with a fan while it was
               approximately 33 degrees outside. She appeared to be high with
               droopy highs and paler complexion. I had her show me her tongue
               and she had a slight green/white milky film. She admitted to
               having smoked but not in her room. She said Moore had nothing
               to do with the marijuana. Freidenburg was told she could not
               have her pipe in the hall per hall policies. I told her she had
               to dispose of it or get it out of the building. She disposed of
               it and I cleared. Nothing follows. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,

               charge the jump pack up longer and return in a little bit or
               that I could provide them with a ride to their residence. They
               both asked for a ride home. I dropped York's friend off at

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W6172 SYNOPSIS: Subject called dispatch
               and said he left his cell phone at Beasley Coliseum. I search
               the area he was seated and did not find the phone. Nothing
               further. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 1202/15 at about 2332 hours I was dispatched to a citizen
               assist call. The reporting party, Asa Sizemore, said he was at
               Beasley for the WSU vs Gonzaga Basketball game earlier in the
               evening and lost his phone. He used his girlfriends phone to
               use an application that locates his phone if lost. The app
               showed his phone was still in Beasley. Sizemore said he was
               seating in section 11 row AA. I searched the area and the
               surrounding areas and could not locate his phone. I asked
               custodial staff and they had not found a phone. They also
               checked the lost and found in the office and did not find a
               cell phone. I called Sizemore and told him I could not find the
               phone. I asked if his app could be used to better pinpoint the
               location of his phone. He said it may be able to but he was at
               work and could not return to Beasley. Sizemore said he would
               attempt to find his phone tomorrow. Nothing further. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.
               Dated this 3rd day of December, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.
