               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W6598 SYNOPSIS: Report of an Alarm at the
               Dodgen Research Center. Building was found secure and no known
               cause for the alarm. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 12/22/15 around 1918 hrs I responded to a report
               of an alarm from zone 0 of the Dodgen Research Center. As I was
               in route I was told Whitcom had spoke with a responsible party,
               later identified as Kaitlyn R Restis (01/18/92), and told the
               alarm was an internet problem. They requested I conduct a
               security check which I did upon my arrival. I found nothing of
               note before contacting Restis. I explained what I had found and
               asked if the alarm system was still active. Restis explained
               she had spoken with her supervisor and did not believe the
               alarm required a response, adding they would check it in the
               morning. After speaking with Restis I contacted Whitcom and
               after asking if the alarms were reset was told they could not
               tell for that particular zone. I was also told all other alarms
               appeared to still being shown to have been currently armed. I
               thanked them and cleared the call a short time later. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 22nd day of December, 2015, in Pullman,
