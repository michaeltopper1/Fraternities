    Narrative: RVWD: Boyd/335 OFC:MTK/336 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #:15-W6622 SYNOPSIS: Agency assist for a DRE
               evaluation. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Dakota P.
               Chatelain 09/11/89 2. NARRATIVE: On 12/26/15 at approximately
               0405 hours I was notified of a one vehicle collision by Deputy
               Jordan (WCSO). Jordan explained that Chatelain had driven his
               car off the roadway after trying to avoid another vehicle.
               Jordan explained that Chatelain said there was an oncoming
               vehicle that he swerved to avoid, but that Chatelain's tire
               marks showed that he drove across the oncoming lane of travel
               and then left the roadway. Jordan said Chatelain provided a PBT
               of .059 and admitted to taking Xanax and smoking marijuana.
               Jordan said Chatelain passed out twice in his vehicle while he
               was on scene waiting for WSP to respond. Each time Jordan had
               to shake Chatelain awake, and the first time Chatelain did not
               remember talking to Jordan previously. Jordan said he was
               waiting for WSP to handle the DUI. Trooper Blood arrived on
               scene and arrested Chatelain for DUI and transported him to
               WSCO holding facility. No roadside sobriety tests were
               administered because Chatelain lost a shoe in the snow. I
               responded to WCSO jail for the evaluation. I watched Chatelain
               as Trooper Blood walked him into the holding facility.
               Chatelain was unsteady on feet and I noticed he now had two
               left shoes on. Trooper Blood said he found another shoe in
               Chatelain's vehicle. I spoke with Chatelain in the BAC room of
               the holding facility. I asked Chatelain if he remembered the
               rights that were read to him and he repeated them and said that
               he did. I told him they still applied through out the process.
               I explained the process and he agreed to perform the
               evaluation. At the end of the evaluation it was my opinion as a
               certified DRE, Chatelain was under the influence of a CNS
               Depressant, Cannabis, and alcohol, and was unable to operate a
               motor vehicle safely. I provided Trooper Blood with my
               observations and he applied for and was granted a search
               warrant to draw Chatelain's blood. See supplement for complete
               details of evaluation. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 27th day of December,
               2015, in Pullman, Washington.
