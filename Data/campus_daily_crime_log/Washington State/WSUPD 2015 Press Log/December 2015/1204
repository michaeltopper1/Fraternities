               DWLS 3rd 2. NARRATIVE: On 12-04-15 I was traveling east on
               Terre View when I saw a dark color pickup turn off of Northwood
               onto Terre View. It turned left and headed east. There was a
               loud exhaust sound and the vehicle sped off. I sped up to the
               vehicle and was following it at 45 miles per hour. The reading
               was from my radar unit. I activated my emergency lights and
               stopped the vehicle on Terre View near the Golf Course. I
               contacted the driver a Kenneth Stratton III and told him the
               reason for the stop. He said he was in a hurry to get to Moscow
               and didn't realize he was driving over the posted speed limit.
               I went back to may patrol car and ran Stratton. He came back
               DWLS 3rd for an unpaid ticket out of Seattle. I re-contacted
               Stratton. I told him about the suspension. He stated that he
               was in the process of contesting the ticket in question and had
               received an e-mail from DOL stating his suspension would not be
               in effect until 12-31-15. He showed me the letter in his phone.
               I told him even though he had the letter he was not going to be
               allowed to drive the vehicle away. He understood. Since the
               vehicle was safely off the roadway I gave him gave him a ride
               to his friends home. I told him I was not going to do anything
               criminally to him but he needed to not drive until he sorted
               the suspension out. I also told him I wold not be writing him a
               speeding ticket. He said he would first thing Monday and I
               dropped him off at his friends home. Nothing

               at approximately 2305 hours I was driving through the Blue 1
               lot on the south side of the Magic Forest off of Forest Way. I
               noticed a vehicle occupied in the lot, with the engine not
               running. I drove through the lot and parked a distance away. I
               walked up to the vehicle and noticed it was occupied by 4
               people. I walked up to the driver's window and shined my
               flashlight in. The occupants of the vehicle were surprised and
               I noticed the driver drop something into his lap. I saw a
               grinder in the driver's lap which contained what I recognized
               as marijuana. The driver rolled down his window and I asked who
               in the vehicle was 21 and everyone was under the age of 21. I
               asked who had a medical marijuana card and none of the
               occupants did. I noticed a bag containing marijuana on the
               console in front of the passenger. I asked how much marijuana
               was in the car and the driver looked around. I pointed out the
               bag of marijuana on the dash board and the grinder in his lap.
               I asked the driver and passenger for their ID's, which they
               provided. The driver was identified as Austin C. Auttelet
               06/11/96 and the passenger was identified as Morgan G. Mannon
               05/12/97. Mannon handed me the bag of marijuana when he gave me
               his ID. I asked who it belonged to and he said it was his. I
               asked Auttelet how much more marijuana was in the car and he
               handed me a jar with marijuana and the grinder. Mannon had a
               bong between his feet, which did not have marijuana in it so I
               let him keep it. I asked Auttelet and Mannon if they had been
               contacted by the police before for marijuana and they both said
               no. Mannon said he got in trouble through the school, but not
               the police. When I returned to the department I noticed Mannon
               had been previously contacted by WSUPD on 11/13/15 with charges
               forwarded for possession of marijuana. Mannon had 2 prior
               contacts by WSUPD where he was warned for marijuana. I returned
               to WSUPD with the marijuana. I NIK tested the marijuana in the
               grinder and the plastic bag. Both tests returned presumptive
               positive for the presence of cannabis sativa. I entered the
               marijuana into evidence. Charges forwarded. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W6225 SYNOPSIS: Subject arrested for MIP
               Exhibiting. PBT .171. Charges will be forwarded to the
               prosecutor. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Daniel P.
               Vossler 06/28/95 Charges Forwarded MIP Exhibiting 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 12/05/15 at approximately 0019 hours I was driving
               northbound on Spokane Street when I noticed a male, later
               identified as Daniel Paul Vossler 06/28/95, bent at the waist
               and vomiting into the grass in front of Dana Hall. I noticed
               the male as I was passing him so I turned around. While
               catching back up to Vossler, he was now walking southbound on
               Spokane. Vossler was stumbling side to side as he walked taking
               up almost the entire width of the sidewalk. I passed Vossler
               and pulled over. While walking up to Vossler I noticed he
               appeared to be under the age of 21. I asked Vossler if he had a
               second to talk and he stopped. I asked Vossler if he was ok
               since I had seen him vomiting. Vossler said he was not feeling
               well. I asked Vossler if he just had a little too much to drink
               and he said, "yeah." I asked Vossler if he had his ID with him
               and he said no. I asked Vossler if he had his WSU Cougar Card
               and he pulled out his wallet. When Vossler began to pull out
               his Cougar Card I could see a Washington Drivers License and
               asked him for it. As Vossler was trying to take his ID out of
               his wallet, Vossler stumbled forward almost falling into me.
               Vossler handed me his WADL which identified him as 20 years
               old. I asked Vossler if I could look at his eyes and he said I
               could. I told Vossler to stand with his heels and toes together
               while keeping his arms at his sides. I told Vossler to follow
               the tip of my pen with his eyes only while keeping his head
               still. During the test Vossler was swaying side to side and was
               leaning backwards by a great degree. About halfway through the
               test Vossler lost his balance and stumbled backwards about two
               steps. During the test I observed equal tracking, lack of
               smooth pursuit, distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum
               deviation, and onset of nystagmus prior to 45 degrees in both
               eyes. Vossler's eyes were watery and bloodshot. As Vossler
               stood before me I could smell the overpowering odor of
               intoxicants coming from his breath. I asked Vossler how much he
               had to drink tonight and he said, "too much, I'll be honest." I
               asked Vossler if he was willing to provide a voluntary PBT
               sample and Vossler said he would. I found my PBT (Alco-Sensor
               FST #16805) in working condition. Vossler provided a PBT sample
               of .171. I told Vossler that I was going to be forwarding
               charges of MIP Exhibiting to the prosecutor and I explained the

               process. I told Vossler that I would drive him the rest of the
               way to Stephenson due to his high intoxication level. I asked
               Vossler if he was done vomiting and he said yes. I told Vossler
               if he felt sick to let me know and I would let him out of the
               car. While en route to Stephenson Complex Vossler did not keep
               his word and started vomiting in the backseat of my patrol car.
               I redirected to the station so Vossler could clean up his vomit
               from my patrol car. Once at the station Vossler was provided
               with cleaning supplies and he cleaned up most of the vomit. Due
               to Vossler's high intoxication level he was not being very
               effective in his cleaning efforts. Vossler began to vomit again
               and I grabbed a trash can for him. I also provided Vossler with
               a chair since he was so unsteady on his feet. Vossler was able
               to contact his roommate, Jared Joseph Fletcher 02/08/95, who
               said he would come pick Vossler up. Vossler vomited off and on
               for about the next 20 minutes while waiting for Fletcher to
               arrive. At several different points I asked Vossler a series of
               questions to determine his mental status. Each time Vossler was
               able to answer all my questions correctly. Once Fletcher
               arrived I turned Vossler over to him. I again explained the
               forwarding charges process to Vossler and told him he was free
               to go. END OF REPORT I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 5th day of December,

               Fire was dispatched to an unconscious subject on Cougar Way
               near the gyms. I responded and was directed to the bench on the
               west side of Bohler Gym. I saw a male subject kneeling on the
               ground facing the bench with his head on the bench. As I exited
               my vehicle he began to move around and stand up. I told the
               subject to sit down because he was very unsteady on his feet
               and I did not want him falling down. I asked the subject where
               he was going and got no response. I had to asked several time
               because his head was down in his lap and he was mumbling, but
               he eventually said U of I. When the subject spoke there was a
               strong odor of intoxicants on his breath. I asked the subject
               several other questions, but he either didn't answer them or
               mumbled towards the ground. Medics arrived on scene and
               evaluated the subject. He became more coherent and we learned
               that he is a U of I student and his friends left him. He was
               trying to get back to the AGR house in Moscow. The subject
               removed his wallet and handed it to me and I identified him by
               ID driver's license as Michael R. Odell 07/22/96. Odell's phone
               battery was dead so he could not call his friends. I asked
               Odell if he wanted a taxi and he agreed to that. Whitcom
               contacted Pro Cabs and they responded and picked up Odell.
               Odell was polite and cooperative while dealing with me. Send to

               On 12-05-15 at approximately 0250 hours I was on patrol when I
               observed a yellow, 2012 Chevrolet Camaro (ID. 1BU9042)
               traveling northbound on Thatuna St. The vehicle came to a stop
               at the intersection of Thatuna and Colorado St. in the right
               hand turn lane. The left hand turn signal was activated on the
               vehicle, and the vehicle made a left hand turn onto Colorado
               St. from the right hand turn lane. I pulled behind the vehicle
               and activated my emergency lights for the above described
               violation near A St. However, the vehicle continued traveling
               until it finally came to a stop on Monroe St. and Colorado St.
               I contacted the driver of the vehicle, who was later identified
               as Saleh Z. Aldoussari (DOB 07-06-96) by his Colorado State
               driver's license. I told Aldoussari I was audio and video
               recording, and I explained the reason I pulled him over. I
               asked to see his driver's license, vehicle registration, and
               proof of insurance, and he said "of course". Aldoussari handed
               me his driver's license, but I had to remind him about the
               vehicle registration and proof of insurance. He then handed me
               his vehicle registration, and then I had to ask again for the
               proof of insurance. I told him just to continue looking for his
               proof of insurance and if he finds it to just wait in the
               vehicle and I would be back, and he said "okay". Sgt. Kuhrt
               arrived on scene as backup officer. I returned to my patrol
               vehicle and I radioed Dispatch to do a records check on
               Aldoussari. His driver's return came back clear and valid. I
               returned to the driver side of the Chevrolet and spoke with
               Aldoussari. I asked him if he was able to find his proof of
               insurance, and he said no. He told me the vehicle belonged to
               his cousin, and he did not know where he kept it. I asked him
               if he had anything to drink tonight, and he said no. His eyes
               appeared watery. I asked him if I may check his eyes, and he
               said I may. I tried to check his eye's for HGN in the vehicle,
               but he would not keep his head still and kept moving it. I
               asked Aldoussari if he would be willing to take a voluntarily

               preliminary breath test (PBT), and I told him it does not
               replace the evidentiary breath test, and he said he would take
               it. I explained the PBT and how to blow, and I asked him if he
               understood, and he said yeah. He provided me a very weak breath
               sample of .044. I asked Aldoussari if he wanted to be a little
               more honest with me about drinking, and he kept denying it. I
               asked him to please step out of the vehicle, and he did. I
               could smell the medium odor of intoxicants coming from
               Aldoussari's breath. I told him he was under arrest for minor
               operating a motor vehicle after consuming alcohol, and I
               handcuffed him (double locked). I advised him again that he was
               being audio and video recorded. I walked him to the back of my
               patrol vehicle and I read him his Constitutional Rights from my
               department issued Miranda Warning card. When I asked him if he
               understood his rights, and he said no. He told me he speaks
               Arabic. Sgt. Kuhrt asked Aldoussari if someone could come pick
               up the vehicle otherwise it would be towed because it was
               illegally parked on the side of the road. None of his
               passengers were able to drive. He said his cousin would pick it
               up. Sgt. Kuhrt brought Aldoussari his cell phone and he called
               his cousin and told him he needed to come get the vehicle. I
               searched Aldoussari incident to arrest, without further
               incident. I placed him in the back of my patrol vehicle and
               transported him to Pullman Police Department (PPD) holding
               facility. Once we arrived at PPD, I searched Aldoussari one
               more time before taking him out of handcuffs. I went into the
               interview room with Aldoussari where the telephone is located.
               I called Dispatch on the phone and asked to be put in touch
               with a translator who speaks Arabic. Dispatch called the
               language line for me. The volume of the female on the other end
               speaking Arabic was very low and she kept saying she could not
               hear me or Aldoussari very well. I said I would call Dispatch
               back to try and get a better connection with the translator. I
               called back and we still could not hear the translator very
               well, and they could not hear us. I tried calling from my cell
               phone, but ended up with the same results. I ended up bringing
               Aldoussari to one of the phones located just off the lobby, but
               we still could not hear the translator. I told Aldoussari he
               was catching a big break, and that I would be forwarding
               charges on him for minor exhibiting the effects of having
               consumed alcohol in a public place. Aldoussari's three cousins
               were waiting in the lobby for him. They all thanked me for
               arresting him before he hurt himself or others while driving. I
               explained to them what happened and how I would be forwarding
               charges to the Whitman County Prosecuting Attorney's Office for
               minor exhibiting. Aldoussari is also a student at the
               University of Idaho, so he will be referred to Student Conduct.
               I provided them with the case number, and told them how to look
               up the number for the office. His cousin, Khalid M. Aldossari
               (05-21-93), provided me with his name, address: 412 S. Asbury
               St. Apt. 12 Moscow, ID 83843 and phone number: (208) 310-9055.
               His cousin Khalid said he could translate any paperwork or
               information from the courts to Aldoussari. I explained to them
               that there may be a warrant issued for his arrest, if he does
               not show up to a court appearance. They all said they

               understood. I returned Aldoussari's property to him and he left
               with his cousins. I cleared the scene. No further action. My
               Vievu camera was activated, and the video was later downloaded
               into the permanent digital evidence folder. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
