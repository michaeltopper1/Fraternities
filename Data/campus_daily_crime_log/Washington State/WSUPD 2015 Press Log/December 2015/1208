               that was thrown all over the hallway. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 12-08-15 at about 0802 hours I
               was dispatched to the report of a malicious mischief. Alexander
               Svensson was requesting contact regarding toilet paper that was
               thrown all over the 4th floor of Gannon Hall. I called Svensson
               and asked what was going on. He said sometime last night
               somebody threw toilet paper all over the hallway and it was a
               mess. I asked if anything was damaged and he said that a
               whiteboard in the laundry room may have been damaged. He said
               it was just a really big mess. I asked Svensson how I could
               help him. He said "if you're not busy, it would be nice if you
               could walk through the hall and instill some fear into the
               residents so it doesn't happen again." I told Svensson that
               instilling fear in people is not the function of the police and
               I would not be doing that. He said again that it was a big
               mess. I told him that I also would not be cleaning it up and
               asked again if there was anything I could do to help. He told
               me just to document the situation. I told him I would and gave
               him the case number. I did not take pictures of the toilet
               paper. No suspects or leads. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 8th day of

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: JAK/333 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W6290 SYNOPSIS: A WSU employee called
               Whitcom stating a car was parked outside with its window down.
               The employee was concerned as it was raining outside and they
               did not want the car to get ruined. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 12-08-15, a WSU Custodian
               called Whitcom stating a green sedan (WA/AJM3330) was parked
               outside, near the loading dock of Stephenson North. The
               custodian said the sedan already had 2 parking tickets on it,
               but was concerned because the sedan's window was down and it
               was raining outside. I looked up the vehicle's license plate in
               Spillman and was not able to locate the vehicle or anyone
               associated with it. I looked up the Registered Owner's name
               (Jose Leyva Hernandez Jr) in WSU's "My WSU" computer system and
               could not find the person. I called WSU Parking and
               Transportation services to see if they had any information on
               the Registered Owner and how to contact them. They said they
               did not have a phone number or local address for the Registered
               Owner. Since I had no way of contacting the Registered Owner of
               the car, I did not respond to the scene or take any further
               action. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 8th day of December,

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W6292 SYNOPSIS: Report of an email
               phishing scam. Investigation continues. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 12-08-15 at about 1054 hours I
               was asked to investigate a possible phishing scam. Sgt. Daniels
               advised that an email had been sent to the police@wsu.edu email
               address by a subject advising they had received an email they
               believed was a phishing scam. The email sent to the Police
               Department was from "Curtis Powell" and said the following; I
               am writing to let you know that an individual with the email
               address of sandy.welch@wsu.edu has been sending out emails as
               part of a phishing scam." I sent Powell an email asking him to
               forward any emails he has from that email address that he
               believes are part of the scam. He has not responded. I then
               checked the myWSU system for "Sandy Welch". I found that Sandy
               Welch (04-07-76) has an assigned email address of
               sandy.welch@wsu.edu. I found two phone numbers for Welch. The
               phone number listed as her cell phone has been disconnected. I
               called the phone number listed as her home address. Nobody
               answered, I left a voicemail message asking Sandy to return my
               call. There is no local address listed for Sandy. At this time
               it is not known what the "phishing emails" said or asked for.
               At about 1123 hours I received notification that central IT has
               reset the account password for "Sandy Welch" which should stop
               the "phishing emails" from being sent from her account. Once I
               get the emails from Powell I will add them to this case. As of
               12-09-15 I have not received the emails from Powell or a phone
               call from Welch. IT has already changed the password on Welch's
               account to stop the phishing emails from being sent. No further
               investigation at this time. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 8th day of December,

               posts on "YikYak". NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 12-08-15, I was asked by our dispatch center to
               take a look at the "Others" call on the Spillman screen. I
               determined someone made posts on "YikYak" they were going to
               kill themselves by jumping off of the Holland Library room onto
               the WSU Cougars football practice field. I contacted the
               "Emergency Law Enforcement" site for "YikYak" and asked for
               their assistance. They provided me with the following
               information: Latitude: 46.7405 Longitude: -117.169 Time Posted:
               2015-12-08 20:14:14 IP Address: 76.178.152.117 Phone Number:
               +15093395315 I was able to determine the phone number was
               issued by Frontier. The IP address was issued by Time Warner.
               The latitude and longitude came back to the area of the
               Providence Court / Church Hill Downs apartments. I called the
               City of Pullman Police Department and asked for their
               assistance as the apartments are located in their jurisdiction.
               Officer Umbright responded to the WSU Police Department.
               Corporal Edwards was able to locate a Profile page on Facebook
               which had the phone number of 509-339-5315 associated with the
               profile. The name of the person on the profile page is Mohammed
               Alshoukri. Officer Umbright called the Property managers for
               the Providence Court apartments and the Church Hill Downs
               apartments and asked if they had Alshoukri listed as one of
               their apartment residents. They said he was a resident of
               Church Hill Downs, apartment M102. Officer Umbright, Corporal
               Edwards, and I responded to Church Hill Downs and knocked on
               the apartment door. No one answered the door. I called (509)
               339-5315 and it did not even ring. I immediately got a message
               stating the caller has a voice mail box that has not been set
               up. Officer Umbright and I responded to the Property Manager's
               office again to see if there were any listed roommates at
               apartment M-102 or if they had any other phone numbers for
               Alshoukri. We were informed Alshoukri does not have any
               roommates and they did have another phone number listed on his
               application (509) 715-7774. I brought this information back to
               the WSU Police Department and briefed Officer Welter as to what
               happened. I asked Officer Welter to attempt to contact
               Alshoukri at his apartment this evening. WSU Cougar Security
               personnel were authorized to perform security checks on the
               mall/top of Holland Library area to be on the lookout for
               Alshoukri. The case has been handed over to Swing Shift to
               follow up on. More to follow. I certify and declare under

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W6295 SYNOPSIS: RP reporting he lost his
               cell phone earlier today. Phone was later located and returned.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 12-08-
               15 at approximately 1236 hours, I contacted the RP, Chae Lim,
               in the WSU PD lobby reference a lost cell phone. Chae stated he
               was in class at Todd Auditorium starting at 0745 hours. He
               stated he had his phone with him in class and had used it. He
               stated he left class at approximately 0820 hours, and walked to
               the CUE for another class. He stated when he got there he
               noticed his phone was gone. When he returned to the auditorium
               to look for it, he could not find it. Chae stated it was a
               black Samsung Note 3 cell phone in a black plastic case. Chae
               stated he has an android app to try and locate the phone, but
               it states the android is unavailable. He stated he had borrowed
               a friend's phone and called his cell and there was no answer.
               He stated he called several times and the last time he called
               it seemed the phone had been turned off. I later called the
               number and it went directly to voicemail. I gave Chae my
               business card and asked him to try and find the serial number
               for the phone. He said he would. I also advised him to check
               the offices in Todd Hall to see if anyone turned it in and he
               said he would. I sent IT the information for the phone to see
               if it could be tracked on the WSU system. Chae later called me
               and stated his phone had been found. His professor had picked
               up the phone and it was returned to him. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               8th day of Decmeber, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               hours I was dispatched to a theft call at Regents Hall. The
               reporting party, Katrina Bittner, said her laptop was stolen
               from the study lounge. I responded and talked to Bittner. She
               said she was studying in the lounge, when she left to go to the
               bathroom. When she returned her ear buds and her note pad were
               still on the table in the lounge but her computer was missing.
               I talked to RA's and the RED about any recent theft activity
               and they were not aware of any. I checked local records and
               could not find any similar thefts at the Regents Complex.
               Bittner attempted to track her computer with the find my iPhone
               application. It showed the laptop was still in the Regents
               Complex. I knocked on some doors near where the app showed her
               computer to be to ask if anyone had seen anything or knew
               anything about a missing laptop. No one I spoke to knew
               anything about the laptop. I asked Bittner to e-mail the serial
               number for the computer to me so I could enter the computer
               into NCIC and WACIC. I gave her my business card with the case
               number on it and cleared the scene. At 1130 I received an e-
               mail from Bittner stating the laptop had been found next to the
               janitors closet in a pile of trash bags. I believe the laptop
               was stolen and discarded later. No suspects or leads at this
               time. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the
               laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and

               12/08/15 around 2026 hrs I was dispatched to a report of
               someone screaming for help in the area of the Football
               Operations Building. As Ofc Whitman and I responded we were
               told the complainant had heard this approximately 15 minutes
               prior. Whitman and I searched the area along with contacting a
               worker inside of the Football Operations Building. I was told
               by the worker he had been in the building since approximately
               1700 hrs and had not heard anyone screaming or appearing to be
               in any distress. I thanked him and both Whitman and I cleared
               after being unable to locate any problems in the area. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W6309 SYNOPSIS: Dispatched to a
               harassment call at Perham Hall. Hall staff found derogatory
               speech written on the white board of a room. The resident was
               contacted and was not concerned. He thought it was friends just
               "messing with him". Harassment unfounded. Forward to OEO.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               12/08/15 at about 2339 hours I was dispatched to a harassment
               call at Perham Hall. I responded and talked the RA's who were
               doing their rounds. They saw "Noah is a fag" written in black
               dry erase marker on the white board attached to room 604 and
               call it in. I photographed the white board and then knocked on
               the door. A male, identified as Noah Brandt answered the door.
               I asked if he had seen what was no his door, he had not. When
               he saw it he erased it with his hand and said it was probably
               friend "messing with him". I asked if he was concerned with
               what was written or anything else that was happening on his
               floor. He said he was not. Harassment unfounded. Forward to
               Office of Equal Opportunity. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: ENW/328 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W6310 SYNOPSIS: Report of a car alarm
               going off. The responsible party was contacted and advised.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Barbour, Shelby S
               (09/25/97) Contacted 2. NARRATIVE: On 12/09/15 around 0030 hrs
               I was dispatched to a report of a car alarm repeatedly going
               off in front of Rogers Hall. As I was in route Whitcom told me
               the vehicle was a black Volkswagon Beetle and upon my arrival I
               located the vehicle (Ca. 7CWS955). The car alarm was not
               currently going off upon my arrival and after contacting the
               complainant, later identified as Gabrielle M Coggili
               (05/11/95), I confirmed this was the same vehicle in question.
               I requested Whitcom try and locate a responsible, and was told
               they had no names that matched. Upon locating a WSU Parking
               permit Ofc Whitman was able to locate a responsible party,
               later identified as Shelby S Barbour (09/25/97), whom I
               contacted a short time later. After reaching Barbour I
               explained why I was calling and told her I had been sitting
               next to her vehicle for the past 13 minutes without the alarm
               going off. I continued and told her she could elect to do
               nothing or turn off the alarm so it does not go off again. She
               told me she understood and we concluded our call a short time
               later. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 9th day of December,
               2015, in Pullman, Washington.
