               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W6334 SYNOPSIS: Report of a female who
               had fallen and was now acting confused. Subject was transported
               to PRH by Pullman Medics. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR#
               1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 12-10-15 at approximately 0739 hours, I
               responded to McCoy Hall room 231 for a female who had fallen
               and hit her head and was now disoriented. I contacted the
               female who was identified as Erika Kovis. Erika was very
               confused and was unable to answer questions. She was unaware
               she had fallen and hit her head. I could see a bruise and
               swelling forming over her right eyebrow. She also had a small
               cut to her left pinky finger. As we waited for medics to
               arrived, I continued to ask Kovis questions. She was able to
               speak, but when asked specific questions, like what building
               she was in, she was unable to tell me the name. She also kept
               asking what had happened. I also noticed while speaking with
               her that her smile was slightly drooping on one side. Pullman
               Medics arrived and evaluated her. She was transported to PRH. I
               attempted to have Whitcom contact her husband, but he was not
               at work yet and the phone number listed for him was her cell
               phone. The medics were advised and were going to relay the
               information to PRH. I cleared. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 10th day of

               called concerned about a post she saw on the Facebook site for
               WSU parents. I called her and answered her questions. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 12-10-15, at
               approximately 0855 hours, Christine A. Mair (02-21-70) called
               Whitcom wanting to speak with a WSU Police Officer. I called
               Mair at the phone number she gave (425) 344-2427 and asked what
               I could do for her. She said she had a child attending WSU and
               had seen a post on Facebook which concerned her. She said she
               was monitoring the "Parents of WSU Students" Facebook site and
               saw a post from someone saying they were in the CUB, she needed
               hugs, she was raped, and the WSU Police Department was "Messing
               Up" the investigation. Mair wanted to know if we were aware of
               the post and wanted to insure the post was not made by some "60
               year old man trying to lure people to the CUB". I informed Mair
               we are; in fact, aware of the post, are currently investigating
               it, have the person who made the post identified, and have a
               meeting scheduled this afternoon between the person and the WSU
               Chief of Police. Mair said she wishes an administrator of the
               particular Facebook site would post some sort of announcement
               when these type of posts are made stating something to the
               effect of "WSU is aware of the situation" and provide some sort
               of details as to what is being done about it. Mair said she has
               a child who is a current student at the Pullman campus and is
               also on the Autistic spectrum. She said every time her child
               has reached out for help it has been nothing short of GREAT.
               She praised WSU for it's Access Center as well as all of the
               accommodations. I told Mair I would pass along her request and
               she thanked me. She also said she would post on the Facebook
               site herself stating she has spoken with the Police Department
               and feels the issue is being handled appropriately. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 10th day of December, 2015, in Pullman,

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W6338 12/10/15 SYNOPSIS: Violation of
               temporary protection order #152002609. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. ARELLANO,CARLOS Forwarded Violation of
               Temporary (09/03/89) Protection Order 2. NARRATIVE: On December
               10, 2015 at about 1201 hours I was dispatched to a report of an
               order violation. The complainant/victim, Angelica Gonzalez
               Herrera (06/03/94) requested telephone contact. I called
               Gonzalez Herrera at about 1208 hours. Gonzalez Herrera told she
               was just contacted in person by her ex boyfriend Carlos
               Arellano (09/03/89) outside of Todd Hall 130. She said there is
               a temporary protection order in place that does not allow him
               to contact her. She was surprised to see him as he lives in
               Wenatchee and is not a WSU student. Gonzalez Herrera went on to
               tell me that Arellano came up to her and began asking her about
               going to court tomorrow. They are scheduled to be in Whitman
               County Court tomorrow morning, December 11, 2015, regarding the
               temporary order. The encounter happened in the hallway outside
               of room 130. Gonzalez Herrera was able to walk away from
               Arellano and go inside her classroom where she called the
               police. Gonzalez Herrera is scared of Arellano because he has
               been violent to her in their past dating relationship. Gonzalez
               Herrera told me Arellano was wearing jeans, a light blue shirt,
               a camouflaged baseball hat, and a gray vest. She said he is
               very familiar with her schedule and knows where her classes
               are. Officer Kirshner and I responded to Todd Hall and checked
               the area. Sgt. Daniels and Sgt. Macy responded to the CUB to
               check the area. We were unable to locate Arellano. Officer
               Kirshner and I waited outside of the classroom until Gonzalez
               Herrera's class was over. We escorted her to the WSU Police
               Department. Gonzalez Herrera provided a written statement that
               reads: "Today December 10, 2015 I was approached by Carlos
               Arellano, at about 11:53 am. As I walked into Todd hall 1st
               floor, Carlos was standing by my classroom (room 130). As soon
               as he saw me walk into the building he approached me and said
               he wanted to talk, then asked me if I really was going to go
               tomorrow to court. I told him to leave me alone 3 times. He got
               closer to me and said again to give him a few minutes to talk.
               I then walked into the classroom to get away from him..." I
               asked Gonzalez Herrera how certain she was that Arellano was
               the person contacting her. She said "100 percent." Gonzalez
               Herrera told me they dated for about 1.5 years and she knows
               him well. I asked her if he made physical contact with her. She
               said he put his hand on her arm as he was being insistent about

               not wanting her to go to court. According to Gonzalez Herrera
               the encounter lasted less than a minute. When I had Whitcom run
               Arellano through NCIC he came back as being restrained from
               contacting Gonzalez Herrera. The order was served on Arellano
               on December 1, 2015. Temporary Protection Order #152002609
               restrains Arellano from the following conditions: PCO/01-THE

               I left a message as it went to voicemail. He called me back at
               about 1403 hours. He said "I knew I fucked up, I understand I
               violated it." He went on to say "I am not a criminal, well, I
               am a criminal." Arellano admitted to being in Todd Hall and
               contacting Gonzalez Herrera. He said he was with his friend to
               pick up his truck. Arellano then told me he was trying to meet
               with Pullman Police Officer Emerson and has been trying to call
               him. Arellano told me he was outside of Lewiston, ID and would
               not be able to come back up to Pullman for a few hours. We
               talked about turning himself in for violating the order. He
               said he would turn himself in but did not want to stay in jail
               overnight. I told him that he could come to the WSU Police
               Department to turn himself in. Charges will be forwarded. I

               wallet was stolen out of her backpack while it was unattended
               in the CUB. No suspects or leads. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 121015 at approximately 1605
               hours I was dispatched to the report of a stolen wallet. The
               victim was waiting in the PD lobby. I responded and met with
               Kelime R. Dilara (102296). Dilara said she was not exactly sure
               how or when her wallet may have been taken. She recounted that
               she had gotten out of her car at approximately 2345 hours on
               120915 and took it into her boyfriend's residence hall (Orton
               1136). The next morning she went to the CUB to study around
               1100 hours. She mentioned that she very briefly went to the
               bathroom but left her bag unattended. She later discovered the
               wallet missing, thought it could have been left at her
               boyfriend's, but later got called by our front desk staff
               saying we had her Debit card, turned in by the CUB. Dilara had
               no suspects or leads. She had already cancelled her debit card
               and said it could be destroyed. The wallet was a folding pink
               Billabong wallet ($30). It did not contain cash but had her
               WADL and assorted insurance cards. I provided Dilara with her
               case number and my business card. On the back I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W6343 SYNOPSIS: Report of a lost/stolen
               I-phone 5. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 12/10/15 around 1600 hrs I was dispatched to a
               report of a stolen cell phone from the Hillside Dining Center.
               I contacted the reporting party, later identified as Jenna M
               Hyppa (042996) and was told the following. Hyppa explained she
               had been working at the Hillside Dining Center between 1030 hrs
               and 1330 hrs. During this time she continued with her job
               duties. As we continued to speak she went on to say she had
               gone into the public restroom between 1130-1200 hrs. As she was
               leaving she forgot to pick up her cell phone. Upon realizing
               she had left the phone she went to retrieve it and found it was
               missing. Hyppa checked the lost and found in the Hillside Cafe
               without success. She went on to tell me she went online to
               track the phone and found it was currently offline, but
               activated the lock feature which disables the phone and will
               only display a message she sent asking the phone to be returned
               to the Hillside Cafe. At this point I asked if she knew what
               the serial number on her phone was and was told she did not.
               She told me the phone was an I-phone 5 with an orange and grey
               case. We discussed how to locate the serial number for the
               phone and she told me she would get me the information when she
               obtained it. We also spoke about securing her information and I
               was told she has her email accounts linked to her phone. I
               spoke to her about changing passwords to all of her accounts
               for her security as well as contacting her cell phone provider,
               which she told me was Verizon. She told me she would once we
               concluded our contact. I provided her with my business card and
               case number for reference, asking to to contact me if the phone
               was turned on and she was able to track it's location. She told
               me she would and I also explained that once she provide me with
               the serial number I would enter the cell phone as a stolen
               article, and in the event she located it to also notify me so I
               could remove the entry. She again told me she would and we
               concluded our contact a short time later. Following my
               conversation with Hyppa I attempted to locate the cell phone on
               various social media sites and web sites. I found nothing
               matching the description provided by Hyppa and will await the
               serial number before proceeding further. Around 1710 hrs Hyppa
               contacted me and provided me with the serial number for her
               phone. I completed the lost/stolen form and placed it into the
               WSU PD Records box to be entered. Nothing further at this time.

               right now. I told him I had time to speak with him, but I just
               needed a couple more minutes to set up my patrol vehicle. I
               told him if he goes and waits by the front office I will be
               with him in a couple of minutes. I asked Schumacher if he could
               give me an idea of what he wanted to discuss with me. His eyes
               were watery with tears, and he said "it's something I have been
               thinking about for awhile". Schumacher went to the front office
               and waited for me there. I met Schumacher out front and I
               brought him into the interview room. He checked to make sure
               the door opened from the inside, and when I asked him what he
               was doing he said that he was just making sure that he could
               leave at anytime. I told him that he was not being detained.
               Schumacher removed his jacket and then asked me where I would
               like to sit. He lifted up his shirt and told me he had a knife
               in his front pocket, and he removed it and set it on the table.
               He took his cell phone, wallet, and keys from his pockets as
               well and set those on the table next to the pocket knife. I
               told him that he was allowed to keep his belongings on him, and
               he replied "I just want everyone to feel very comfortable".
               Schumacher paused for a few seconds and then took a deep breath
               in and told me that he just had this conversation with his
               roommates earlier, and "it was kind of shitty". He then said
               "what I'm about to say is not a spur of the moment thing". I
               told Schumacher I was audio and video recording. He told me he
               has been thinking about suicide for about the past three years
               now. Schumacher told me the things that are stopping him are
               the people who would have to deal with it and the people that
               he would hurt. Schumacher was emotional and crying when he was
               telling me this. He mentioned his best friend in seventh grade
               had committed suicide and it was really hard for him and others

               to deal with. Schumacher mentioned that to a certain degree it
               was not fair for him to be telling me this. I asked him why it
               was not fair, and he said "nobody should have to deal with
               extra shit". I explained to him that I am glad he came to me,
               and it's part of my job. He again mentioned the two reasons why
               he has not committed suicide yet. He told me he was put on
               antidepressants over the summer, and he has been taking them.
               Schumacher told me his dosage on his antidepressant medication
               has increased by a factor of four (from 10 mg to 40 mg). He
               told me he took his medications this morning, yesterday, and
               all the week prior. Schumacher told me he has been to
               counseling twice, and that he was planning on going to WSU
               Counseling Services. I told him that they offer free counseling
               for students, and he told me he knew. Schumacher mentioned that
               he just inherited $26,000 from his grandfather, but that he
               does not want it. I asked Schumacher if I may pat him down for
               weapons, and he said yes. I did not find anything on
               Schumacher. Schumacher was worried he was talking up too much
               of my time, and I assured him I had time to talk and I had
               nothing else to do. Schumacher then mentioned he would not
               carry out his suicide until he speaks with a few more
               individuals. I asked him what his plan was to carry his suicide
               out, and he replied "no fucking clue". I told Schumacher that
               he mentioned he has thought about ways earlier, and I asked if
               he could tell me some. He told me he his class near Holland and
               Terrell Library and that he walks by the railing of the top of
               the library, and he has thought about jumping off of it before.
               However, he said he would never do that especially on campus
               because that would not be fair for other students to have to
               see that. He said it would be unfair for the people that would
               have to clean it up as well. Schumacher again said that he
               would never commit suicide on campus. He then told me he would
               never do it in his house either because then his roommates
               would have to see it. Schumacher said he would like to get
               consent from someone who would find him, who would clean it up,
               and his family. He said he would not carry it out until those
               three criteria were met. He asked me what my thoughts were.
               Schumacher then said he does not have a specific time set or a
               specific way to do it, and that it's not set in stone.
               Schumacher said he would want to make sure that whoever found
               his body would be okay with it for their rest of their life and
               that he would not have an effect on that individual. I told
               Schumacher that he would effect a lot of different individuals
               if he decided to commit suicide. I told him it would even have
               an effect on my life, and he began crying harder than he had
               been before. I asked him if he thought about committing suicide
               tonight, and he said he thinks about it almost every night but
               he did not mention anything about tonight. I asked when he
               thought about jumping over the railing by the library, and he
               said that was last night when he had been studying in the
               Compton Union Building (CUB). He then mentioned he has thought
               about stepping out in front of a car before. I told Schumacher
               he came up to me for help, and that he does not want to go
               through with it. He replied, "yeah, I kind of do actually".
               Schumacher told me has gotten help in the past, and it does not

               work. I asked him if his family knows what he is going through,
               and he said yes. Schumacher again brought up the three criteria
               that would have to be met before he commits suicide. He told me
               step one would be speak with the EMT's, doctors and nurses at
               the hospital to make sure his death would not effect their
               lives. He said step two would be talking with his family. I
               asked if he would speak with all of them in person, and he said
               yeah face to face. I told him I did not believe any of his
               family would be okay with what he was thinking about doing.
               Schuamcher replied "well I might just continue existing". I
               asked him where he was seeing a counselor at, and he said the
               Tri-Cities. I asked when the last appointment with his
               counselor was, and he said September. I asked him if he saw a
               change in emotions when he stopped going to his counselor, and
               he replied "I have been in a downward spiral for the past three
               years". I asked Schumacher if he has roommates. He told me he
               does, and that they are both really good friends of his. I told
               Schumacher that I wanted to take him to the hospital to get
               checked on. I asked him if that would be okay with him, and he
               said no and mentioned that he has exams. I told him that he
               needs to talk to someone in the medical profession, and he
               replied he has an appointment with WSU Counseling Services
               tomorrow 12-11-15 at 1600 hours. Schumacher again mentioned
               that he would make sure when he decides to go through with it
               that it will be somewhere off campus. I told Schumacher I do
               not want him to hurt himself. Sgt. Kuhrt and Ofc. Whitman
               arrived as backup officers. Schumacher asked me if it would be
               easier on me if someone I knew gave me a heads up before they
               committed suicide. I told him it would definitely be harder
               because I would always ask myself what could I have done
               differently to prevent that from ever occurring. I told
               Schumacher I understand he mentioned he has exams coming up,
               but I told him he has bigger concerns at the moment. He told me
               he is about to fail out because his grades are dropping
               significantly. I told him the university would work with him
               because of his depression. Sgt. Kuhrt asked Schumacher if he
               had access to weapons at his house, and he said he has a
               shotgun underneath his bed. Schumacher said we could store it
               at the police department if it would make him feel better, and
               Sgt. Kuhrt told him it would. Sgt. Kuhrt asked if he would be
               willing to go to Pullman Regional Hospital and he agreed. Sgt.
               Kuhrt told him he should come get coffee with us in the future
               and he could have someone to talk with. See Sgt. Kuhrt's
               supplemental report for complete details. Sgt. Kuhrt, Ofc.
               Whitman, and I all provided Schumacher with our business cards.
               I should him the phone numbers for counseling services on the
               back of the business card. I transported Schumacher to his
               residence, and he told me I could come inside. He went into his
               room and retrieved his shotgun inside of his soft case, and he
               handed it to me. We went outside and I gave the shotgun to Sgt.
               Kuhrt. I transported Schumacher to Pullman Regional Hospital. I
               walked him into the entrance and he began to check in. I told
               Schumacher to call me if he needed anything, and he shook my
               hand. I went to speak with the doctor to give him a heads up
               about Schumacher. One of the workers from the front desk said

               Schumacher no longer wants to see anyone because he does not
               want to check in. I went back and asked Schumacher if he wanted
               a ride back to his residence, and he told me he was going to
               walk home. I cleared the scene. I later emailed WSU Counseling
               Services and provided them information about my contact with
               Schumacher, and that he would be in tomorrow for an
               appointment. My Vievu camera was activated, and the video was
               later downloaded into the permanent digital evidence folder. I

               NARRATIVE: On 12/10/15 at approximately 2317 hours I was
               driving eastbound on SR 270 approaching Avista Utilities when I
               noticed a black Porsche Cayenne heading westbound towards me. I
               noticed the Porsche appeared to be traveling at an extremely
               high rate of speed as it passed another car. The Porsche was in
               the inside lane. I activated my in car radar (vehicle 4) and
               obtained a reading of 96 MPH. I watched as the radar reading
               climbed to 100 MPH before the Porsche passed me. I turned
               around and attempted to catch up to the Porsche. The Porsche
               appeared to be slowing slightly as I saw the driver tap the
               brakes several times. As the Porsche approached the
               intersection of Terre View and SR 270 the traffic light was red
               causing the Porsche to slow. I was able to catch up to the
               Porsche and initiate a traffic stop. Once the Porsche came to a
               stop on the shoulder, I contacted the driver who was identified
               as Garren Asiah Jackson 05/24/93. I told Jackson that I was
               recording and asked him if he saw how fast he was going.
               Jackson said around 75 MPH and I corrected him telling him he
               was going 100 MPH. I asked why he was going 100 MPH and Jackson
               said he was in a rush. I asked what he was rushing to and
               Jackson said he was going to meet up with some girls. I asked
               for Jackson's driver's license, proof of insurance, and vehicle
               registration. I noticed that Jackson had three passengers in
               his car. When I was walking up to Jackson's car I noticed there
               were no license plates on the car. Instead was a vanity plate
               that said "BALLERS" on it. I remembered stopping the Porsche
               about 2 months ago for not having license plates. Jackson
               provided his California Driver's License, vehicle registration,
               and an expired proof of insurance. About this time Ofc. Whitman
               arrived on scene. I asked Jackson to exit his car and come talk
               to me outside which he did. When Jackson exited his car I told
               him he was under arrest for Reckless Driving and Reckless
               Endangerment. I handcuffed Jackson and advised him of his right
               to counsel. Jackson was also told he was being audio and video
               recorded. I searched Jackson incident to arrest and found no
               weapons or illegal items. I placed Jackson in the backseat of
               my patrol car. Ofc. Whitman spoke to the passengers and who all

               stated they had been drinking. The passenger called a friend
               who came and picked up the Porsche. The passengers were
               identified as, Kaylyn M. Ayers 05/08/92, Deon J. Watson
               07/24/94, and Marco A. Millan 03/23/92. I told Jackson about
               his passenger's plan and we said he was fine with them taking
               his car. I transported Jackson to the Pullman Holding Facility
               were he was fingerprinted and photographed. I issued Jackson
               Sector citations for Reckless Driving and Reckless
               Endangerment. Jackson was also issued NOI's for no valid proof
               of insurance and no license plates on his vehicle. I explained
               each citation to Jackson and provided him with copies. I told
               Jackson this case would be referred to U of I's student
               conduct. Jackson was released from custody and I cleared. END

    Narrative: RVWD:MTK/336 OFC: BRW/325 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W6359 SYNOPSIS: Two subjects arrested,
               cited, and released for Criminal Trespass at Kimbrough Hall.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Ryan M. Stuart 08/12/96
               Cited/Released Trespassing 5Z1227618 2. Jack G. Bull 06/14/97
               Cited/Released Trespassing 5Z1227619 NARRATIVE: On 12/11/15 at
               approximately 0129 hours I was driving northbound on Library
               Road when I spot lighted the roof of Kimbrough Hall. On the
               roof I could see someone laying down. I parked on the southside
               of the building where I found a female standing near the wall
               everybody uses to climb onto the roof. I asked the female what
               she was doing and she said she was waiting for her friends. I
               asked the female if her friends were on the roof and she said
               yes. I asked the female why she did not go on the roof and she
               said she did not want to get in trouble. Since I had no reason
               to detain the female I did not identify her. About this time
               Ofc. Tiengo arrived on scene and I had him watch the roof while
               I climbed up. Once on the roof I found Ryan Michael Stuart
               08/12/96 and Jack Gregory Bull laying on their stomachs. I
               identified myself and asked them what they were doing on the
               roof. The two stated they were there for the view of the city.
               I told the two to grab their ID's both provided their WADLs. I
               escorted both males off the roof using the access door on the
               second level. Once inside the building I told the two they were
               both under arrest for Criminal Trespass. I told both that I
               would not be handcuffing them as long as they remained
               cooperative. All three of us walked outside to my patrol car
               where I had Stuart and Bull stand with Ofc. Tiengo as I filled
               out their Sector citations. Once the citations were completed,
               I explained the citations to them, and provided them with their
               copies. I told Stuart and Bull that they would also be referred
               to student conduct. I also pointed out the large "NO
               TRESPASSING ON ROOF" sign that they climbed over to get onto
               the roof. I told them it was clear that they understood they
               were not allowed on the roof. I told the two that they were
               free to go and I cleared. END OF REPORT I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               11th day of December, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.
