               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W6577 SYNOPSIS: The complainant reported
               that several packages were stacked up on the ground outside the
               UPS dropbox. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 12-21-2015 at about 2006 hrs the complainant,
               Nathan D. Weller (DOB 12-07-1981), reported that several boxes
               were stacked on the ground outside the UPS dropbox located at
               the corner of Stadium Way and Wilson Road. Weller was concerned
               because the boxes were not secured inside the dropbox. I
               responded to the scene and checked the area. I did not see a
               problem that warranted police intervention, and I cleared the
               scene. No further action at this time. Olmstead/339 I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC:MTK/336 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #:15-W6578 SYNOPSIS: Personal items found in
               the Blue Parking off of Forest Way. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 12/20/15 at approximately 2230
               hours I was driving through the Blue 1 Lot off of Forest Way
               and noticed a laundry basket sitting along the curb. The basket
               was behind where a vehicle would have been parked. It appeared
               that someone forgot to load the basket in their car. I
               retrieved the basket and noticed the name Chas Huston written
               on many of the items. I attempted to call Huston, but his phone
               would not accept calls from blocked numbers. I sent an email to
               two of Huston's email addresses listed in the WSU directory. I
               attached the email to the Files section. I logged the items
               into evidence. Since they were of not much value (towels,
               bedding, school supplies), and the basket was large, I did not
               put it in an evidence locker. I did not see the items when I
               was on patrol on 12/18/15. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               20th day of January, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.
