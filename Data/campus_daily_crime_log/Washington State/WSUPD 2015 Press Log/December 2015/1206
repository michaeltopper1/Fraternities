    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Olmstead/339 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W6250 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched to a
               report of a theft. The complainant reported that someone had
               taken money and a debit card from his wallet. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 12-06-2015 at about
               0952 hrs I was dispatched to a report of a theft at the WSU
               Police Department construction site located near the WSU Power
               Plant on Grimes Way. I contacted the complainant, Zachary N.
               Farncomb (DOB 11-07-1977), on the telephone. Farncomb is a
               construction worker who works at the construction site.
               Farncomb said on 12-03-2015 at about 0615 hrs he arrived for
               work at the construction site and placed his wallet and keys
               into his sports bag which is kept in the "job shack" at the
               workplace. Farncomb said the job shack is a mobile trailer kept
               at the site. Farncomb said he keeps extra clothing and other
               items in the sports bag. Later that same day at about 1400 hrs
               Farncomb was in the job shack and noticed that his sports bag
               was unzipped. Farncomb thought this was strange but did not
               realize anything was wrong. At about 1700 hrs Farncomb
               retrieved his wallet and keys from his sports bag and left
               work. He began driving to his home in Spokane, Washington but
               stopped at the gas station in Colfax, Washington to purchase a
               drink. Farncomb then noticed that his debit card was missing
               from his wallet along with five (5) one dollar bills of United
               States Currency he had in his wallet. Farncomb believes someone
               from the construction site, who had access to the job shack,
               most likely committed the theft. Farncomb said his debit card
               was from the Numerica Credit Union and identified the last four
               (4) numbers of the debit card as: 7576. Farncomb returned home
               and discovered that someone had used his debit card for one
               unauthorized purchase. According to Farncomb's bank statement,
               the transaction occurred at "Chevron Pullman 00356447" on 12-
               03-2015 for an amount of $41.23. Farncomb could not determine
               the time of the transaction. Farncomb said he cancelled his
               debit card, and no further fraudulent charges were identified.
               I made arrangements to meet Farncomb at the construction site
               tomorrow morning, and he will bring a copy of his bank
               statement. Investigation continues. Olmstead/339 I certify and

               1. Kyle K. Stemm 03/29/97 Warned POM 2. NARRATIVE: On 12/06/15
               at approximately 2130 hours I was dispatched to a drugs call at
               Streit Hall Room 212. I responded and met with an RA, Anna
               Prykhodko, and she walked with me to the second floor of
               Streit. Anna explained that they (RA's) were doing rounds and
               smelled the odor of marijuana coming from room 212. Anna said
               they knocked on the door and made contact with the resident.
               When the door was opened they could see a bong. Anna said she
               called the RED on duty (Richard Wallace) and he said to call
               the police, which they did. I went to room 212 and knocked on
               the door. A male answered the door and invited me inside. I
               asked him what was going on. The male, identified by WADL as
               Kyle K. Stemm, said he had a bong in his room. Stemm gave me
               the bong and I set it on the desk. Stemm said he did not have
               any marijuana in the room and I could search the room, which I
               did. Stemm's room smelled of burning marijuana and it was clear
               to me someone had been smoking in the room although Stemm
               denied it. I located an empty glass jar (which smelled of
               marijuana) in a desk drawer. I found a small plastic container
               that had trace amounts of marijuana wax. I told Stemm to gather
               the stem from the bong (which contained a small amount of
               marijuana) and the wax and to throw them away in the dumpster.
               I followed Stemm to the dumpster and watched him dispose of the
               items. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 7th day of December,

               four other males. At some point he saw his roommate, Jack
               Jensen, point it at a male, later identified as Nicolas Viola,
               and tell him he was going to shoot him. I asked him if he
               thought the gun was real. He said it looked real. I asked him
               if Viola was scared. He said he thought he was. I asked if
               Jensen seemed serious/mad. He said it scared him so he left. I
               asked him if Jensen was violent and he said he didn't know. I
               asked him if Jensen had been drinking alcohol and he said
               "Yes." I asked him where Jensen was and he said he left with
               the other males. I got Jensen's phone number form him and went
               to my patrol car to call Jensen. He answered I asked him if he
               was in the hall and he said he was. I asked which floor and he
               said the 2nd. I requested him to meet me on the 2nd floor
               landing. I met him on the landing and he provided me with his
               Washington State Drivers license. It showed he was under 21
               years of age. Jensen asked why I wanted to talk to him. As he
               spoke his words were slurred, his eyes were bloodshot and
               watery, and I could smell the odor of intoxicants on his
               breath. I told him I was investigating an incident in the hall
               and needed to speak to him. I asked him where he had been prior
               in the evening. Be began by saying he was in his room all
               night. then he said he was hanging out with friends, then he
               said he was with a girl. There was a few students walking
               around so we moved to the 2nd floor study room. There I asked
               him again to explain to me what he was doing earlier. He again
               changed his story and said he went to the cub to hang out with
               a girl. He returned to his room and went to bed. Four of his
               friends came to the room. they then lest and went to 231
               Gannon. I told him I thought he was lying and asked him about
               the gun. He stared at me for a long time then bowed his head.
               He said he was in his room when four friends showed up. A

               friend of his Matt Pardi found the gun and began playing with
               it. He tried to take it away and that's when the gun got
               pointed around the room. I asked where the gun was and he said
               it was in his lower desk drawer. At that time Sgt Kuhrt came in
               the room. I again told Jensen that I thought he was lying and
               that he had pointed the gun at on of the friends. He again
               denied pointing the gun at any one. Kuhrt asked Jensen if he
               had possessed the gun at any time and he said no, but then
               changed his story and said he had tried to take the gun away
               from Matt. Kuhrt left the room and came back a short time
               later. We spoke in the hallway. Kuhrt told me that Pardi and
               Jensen were playing with the weapon in the room. The gun was
               pointed at Viola, but Viola stated he was not threaten by the
               gun. He knew it was an air soft gun and that it wasn't loaded.
               Since there was no malicious intent we decided to send Jensen
               and Pardi to student conduct. Jensen, Kuhrt and I went to 435
               where we got the gun. We took it into possession and later
               logged it into the armory as a checked gun. I told Jensen he
               could get the gun when he was leaving for break, to take it
               home, and not bring it back. I told him I was sending the
               incident to student conduct. He said he was not coming back to
               WSU after christmas break so he would contact student conduct
               on Monday. Sgt. Kuhrt and I went back to the R/A's room and
               explain to him and Saenjak what we had found out. We told them
               that Jensen was back in the room but we had not told him who
               had reported the incident to the police. Saenjac stated he was
               still too scared to go back to his room. The R/A stated he
               would find another room for him. We told them that if there
               were any more problems to call us. They said they would and we
               left the area. I later logged the gun into the
               armory............... Nothing further............ I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               6th day of December, 2015, in Pullman, Washington. M. Griffin

               1. Matthew V. Pardi 04/09/97 Warned POM 2. Nicolas A. Viola
               05/17/97 NARRATIVE: On 12/06/15 at approximately 2310 hours I
               was assisting Sgt. Griffin in investigating a weapons offense
               at Gannon Hall. I was on the 2nd floor and knocked on the door
               to room 231. I noticed someone look out the peep hole and then
               go back into the room and begin rummaging around. I knocked
               again and it was opened. There were two males in the room,
               identified as Matthew V. Pardi and Nicolas A. Viola. I asked
               the residents if I could talk with them and they invited me
               into the room. While I was in the room speaking with them about
               the weapons offense case I could smell the odor of burning
               marijuana. After I completed my investigation I explained to
               the two that I did not want them to get into any criminal
               trouble for the marijuana in the room. I told them they could
               collect their marijuana and dispose of it. Viola said he didn't
               have any and I could search his stuff. Pardi said he had some
               and removed approximately 2 grams of marijuana from his desk.
               Since I was still busy with the other case I told Pardi I would
               follow him to the bathroom and have him flush it down the
               toilet, which he did. Nothing further. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               7th day of December, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.
