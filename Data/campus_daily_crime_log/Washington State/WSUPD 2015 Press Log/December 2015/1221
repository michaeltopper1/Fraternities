               to a panic alarm at Time Warner Cable. There was no emergency.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 12-21-
               2015 at about 0906 hrs I was dispatched to a panic alarm in the
               cash room at Time Warner Cable, located at 8681 SR 270. The
               Whitman County Sheriff's Office requested an agency assist. I
               arrived on scene and contacted Corey L. Obrien (DOB 02-25-
               1977). Obrien is a Time Warner employee. After speaking with
               Obrien, I determined that the alarm had apparently been caused

               scene. No further action at this time. Olmstead/339 I certify
