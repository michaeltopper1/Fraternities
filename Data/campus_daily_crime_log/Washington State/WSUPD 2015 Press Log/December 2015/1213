    Narrative: RVWD: AE/330 OFC: Olmstead/339 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY
               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W6424 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched
               to a welfare check. The subject was taken into protective
               custody and transported to Pullman Regional Hospital. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 12-13-2015 at
               about 1011 hrs I was dispatched to a welfare check at the
               Chinook Apartments #D22, located at 710 SE Chinook Drive.
               Dispatch advised that the complainant, Sinea M. Moss (DOB 12-
               27-1990), had called and was having some suicidal thoughts.
               Corporal Edwards and I arrived on scene and contacted Moss
               inside her apartment. Moss was crying hysterically and appeared
               to be emotionally upset. Moss is a WSU student and is the
               apartment coordinator for the Chinook Apartments. Moss was
               alone in the apartment. I asked Moss what was going on. Moss
               said she had been taking some new medication and did not
               believe it was working. Moss told me she was feeling depressed
               and was experiencing some suicidal thoughts. I asked Moss to
               explain specifically what type of thoughts she was having. Moss
               said she was thinking about jumping off Webster Hall on campus.
               After speaking with Moss, it was my opinion that she was
               suffering from a mental disorder and was in imminent danger of
               committing serious harm to herself. I advised Moss that she was
               in protective custody, and I would be transporting her to the
               Pullman Regional Hospital. At my direction, Moss provided me
               with her medication. I transported Moss to the hospital and
               provided hospital staff with her medication. The Protective
               Custody form was completed, and Moss was admitted to the
               hospital. I cleared the scene. The Protective Custody form was
               scanned, downloaded into Spillman, and attached to this case.
               My Vievu camera was activated during this incident. For more
               information, see the video, which was downloaded into the
               permanent digital evidence file. No further action at this
               time. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this __13__ day of

               was requesting phone contact regarding a patron who became sick
               after eating at this establishment. I called Keithley and asked
               him what was going on. He told me the following; he said that
               yesterday, at around 1730 hours, an unknown person came into
               the dining center and told the student manager that her sister
               became sick after eating here. This person also said that her
               sister had gone to the hospital and they confirmed that the
               sister had e-coli poisoning. The student manager, did not
               identify the person that came in and has no idea who actually
               got sick. Keithley did not provide the name of the student
               manager and said he was calling just to document the situation
               in the event that there was an e-coli outbreak. I gave Keithley
               the case number. Please forward case to WSU EH&S as well as
               Dining Services. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W6426 SYNOPSIS: Concerned parent
               requesting welfare check on daughter. Daughter was asked to
               call home. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 12-13-15 at about 1052 hours I was dispatched to
               the report of a welfare check. The RP, Judy L. Srp, was
               requesting a welfare check on her daughter, Brittany E. Srp.
               Judy advised that she had not talked to Brittany in 2 days, and
               this was out of the ordinary. She said they spoke to or texted
               each other every single day. Judy was concerned that something
               had happened to Brittany. I went to Brittany's residence at
               Perham Hall room 516. I knocked on the door several times but
               there was no answer. I attempted contact at the RA's room but
               there was no answer. I called Judy to let her know what I had
               done. I could hear in Judy's voice that she was upset and was
               possibly crying. She said this is completely out of the
               ordinary and she truly believed something had happened to
               Brittany. I asked about medical problems or mental health
               issues and Judy said Brittany did not have any problems and has
               not been depressed. She said the last she knew she was hanging
               out with a friend "Alyssa" on Friday night. Judy told me that
               Alyssa lived on the first floor of Perham Hall. I ended my call
               with Judy and found Alyssa in her room, Perham 133. I asked
               Alyssa if she has seen or talked to Brittany. She said not
               since Friday night. She said that she had Brittany's wallet in
               her car and she has not contacted her to retrieve it. Alyssa
               said they were hanging out at an apartment in Campus Commons
               South, B Building. She said that she thought Brittany might be
               with somebody they recently met named Joel. Alyssa called her
               friend Matt who lives in the B building. Matt told Alyssa that
               he saw Brittany yesterday with Joel. Neither Matt or Alyssa
               knew where Joel lived. I asked Alyssa if Brittany seemed happy
               while she was with Joel and she said yes. Alyssa told me that
               Matt knew some people that know where Joel lives. I went to
               Matt's apartment at CCS B110. He told me he saw Brittany
               yesterday and she was with Joel. He thought she was probably
               still with him. He showed me to apartment B111 and said those
               residents might know where Joel lives. I knocked on the door,
               nobody was home. Matt then told me he texted Joel and asked if
               he knew where Brittany was. Joel responded with "in my bed,
               lol". I asked Matt to text him asking Brittany to call home,
               which he did. I returned to my patrol car and called Brittany's
               parents. I spoke with her father and told him what I had
               learned. I told him that Brittany was asked to call home. About

               at approximately 1832 hours, I was dispatched to a report of a
               non injury traffic collision at the intersection of Stadium Way
               and Nevada Street. Upon arrival, both vehicles were parked in
               the Washington Building parking lot. I contacted Kassandra S.
               Strickland and WSUPD Intern Alex Elwell contacted Lawrence A.
               Young. Strickland told me the following. She was driving NB in
               the inside lane of travel on Stadium Way approaching the Nevada
               Street intersection. She told me she wasn't paying attention
               and proceeded to make a left hand turn onto SE Nevada Street.
               As she was turning, her vehicle was hit by Young's 2010 Honda
               Van. Strickland told me she was at fault for the collision. I
               was also contacted by a witness who refused to provide his
               name. The witness told me he saw the same account of events as
               Strickland. I requested Strickland's driver's license,
               registration and proof of current insurance. She was able to
               provide me with all the requested information. Elwell contacted
               Young who told him the following. Young stated he was driving
               SB on Stadium Way approaching the Nevada Street intersection
               and he was driving in the Out side lane of travel. He told
               Elwell he hit the brakes when she turned in front of him and he
               was unable to stop before colliding with Strickland's vehicle.

               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Austin C. Reed 04/17/97 Warned MIP-Exhibiting
               2. NARRATIVE: On 12/13/15 at approximately 2215 hours I was on
               foot patrol walking up the stairs from Stephenson complex
               towards the intersection of Nevada and Olympia. I saw a male
               and female subject walking east on the sidewalk on the south
               side of Olympia. The two caught my attention because it
               appeared that the male was having a very difficult time walking
               and the female had her arm around him to keep his balance. I
               walked behind them and as they got to Roger's Hall they turned
               to go to the side door. I was directly behind them and noticed
               they appeared under the age of 21. I asked them if the male was
               going to make it and the female said she was just helping him
               home to put him in bed. I asked the male how much he had to
               drink and he said 2-3 shots, but that he doesn't drink much.
               While the male spoke I could smell the odor of intoxicants on
               his breath. I asked the male what his name was and he was
               identified as Austin C. Reed 04/17/97. While Reed was speaking
               his words were slow and slurred and I noticed he was swaying in
               a circular motion. The female with Reed said she was going to
               stay with Reed and take care of him. I told Reed I would be
               referring the case to student conduct. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 13th day of December, 2015, in Pullman,

               1. Michael C. Key 09/08/96 Warned POM 2. Ethan D. Marquez
               08/22/97 Warned POM NARRATIVE: On 12/14/15 at approximately
               0220 hours I was dispatched to the report of the odor of
               marijuana in Stephenson East room 327. On 12/09/15 Ofc. Welter
               contacted Michael Key and Ethan Marquez in room 327 and they
               were warned for marijuana. I returned to WSUPD with the
               intention of pursing a search warrant. I called the number
               provided for the reporting party and got in touch with an RA on
               duty, Madeline. I asked Madeline if she was present when the
               odor of marijuana was smelled from room 327 tonight and she
               said she was. I asked Madeline where she was and she said she
               was at room 327 and the residents were in the hall. I asked
               Madeline why the hall director did not call and she said she
               was busy with something else and asked the RA's to call. I
               asked Ofc. Boyd to respond to the room and seize the room so I
               could apply for a search warrant. Ofc. Boyd responded and told
               me one of the subjects had the marijuana with him in his hand.
               I asked Ofc. Boyd to warn the subjects and have the hall
               director call me. Brittany Griffin (on duty RED) called me and
               explained that when she was smelling the door to confirm the
               odor, the residents opened the door. Griffin said she was
               talking with the residents and asked RA's to call the police.
               Ofc. Boyd returned to WSUPD and said that he contacted Marquez
               and Key and warned them for possession of marijuana. Ofc. Boyd
               said that Marquez had a bag in his hand with a small amount of
               marijuana in it. Ofc. Boyd said he escorted Marquez to the
               dumpster where he disposed of it. Nothing further. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.
