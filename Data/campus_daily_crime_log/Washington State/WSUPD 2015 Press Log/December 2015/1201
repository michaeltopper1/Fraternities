               hours I was dispatched to the report of a suspicious
               circumstance at the Red 3 lot near Reaney Park. The RP advised
               there was a white Mitsubishi Outlander parked in the lot,
               running, for the last several hours with nobody around. The
               plate provided was WA/WSU220B. I responded to the parking lot
               and found the vehicle. I did not see any damage or anything
               else out of the ordinary, except it was running. I noticed
               there was no keys in the ignition. I was able to locate the
               owner of the vehicle, Danielle L. Ellsworth. I called Ellsworth
               and confirmed she drives a white Mitsubishi Outlander. I told
               her it has been on for the last several hours. She seemed
               surprised and was confused, especially since she had the keys
               with her and the vehicle is not equipped with a remote start.
               She said she would return to her vehicle and turn it off. I
               asked her to call me back if she noticed anything missing from
               her car. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the

               approximately 1434 hours, I responded to Kruegel Hall for the
               report of an assault which occurred between 1230-1330 hours. I
               contacted the RP, Dave Martin, who stated one of the IALC
               students reported being pushed by a male earlier in the day. A
               witness, Abdullah Alharbi, stated he had seen two black males
               and one white male walk passed the victim, Nizar Aldaerwaesh,
               who had been standing under Kruegel with other friends. When
               the three subjects walked by, one of them pushed Nizar. Adullah
               had to leave for another class. I asked Dave if the Nizar or
               the others were around, and he stated they had already left. I
               told him I would return tomorrow to try and contact them. Dave
               stated they would be in class off and on during the day, but
               they could be pulled out to speak with me. I asked Dave if the
               males who assaulted Nizar were from the IALC and he stated no.
               He was told they had come from the dining center, but was told
               they walk by often. One of the males was described as always
               wearing red and one was described as having light brown hair.
               The three are always seen walking together. Investigation
               continues. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 1st day of December, 2015, in Pullman,

               just east of Forest Way who was reporting a suspicious item.

               hours as I was coming on duty I saw a vehicle on the eastbound
               shoulder of SR 270 just east of Forest Way with its hazard
               lights flashing. I contacted the driver, Drobish-Shahat who was
               on the phone with WHITCOM. The RP said there was an item on the
               side of the road that looked like it could have been a body or
               something rolled up in a blanket or something similar. At the
               same time I heard Whitcom dispatch the suspicious call to
               Pullman PD and whitcom further advised that the WSP was
               enroute. I asked the RP to wait while I went to check on the
               item. Near the east of the guardrail on the east side of SR 270
               as you come out of deadmans corner I saw a heavy blanket on the
               shoulder. I checked the blanket and found it to be a moving
               style pad with nothing in it. I picked up the pad and went and
               told the RP what I have found. I thanked her for her call and
               cleared the scene. At WSU PD I put the pad in the dumpster.
               nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
