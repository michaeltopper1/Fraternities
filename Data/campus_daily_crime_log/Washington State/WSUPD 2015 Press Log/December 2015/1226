               was dispatched to a report of lost property at Beasley
               Coliseum, located at 925 NE North Fairway Road. The

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: JAK/333 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W6624 SYNOPSIS: A female was warned for
               not having her dogs on a leash in the area of the WSU Wild
               Ungulate Facility. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 12-26-15, at approximately 0947 hours, Alexandra
               L. Prosken (12-15-86) called Whitcom stating there were 2
               hunting dogs scaring animals at the WSU Wild Ungulate Facility.
               Officer Olmstead responded to the area of the entrance to the
               USDA property just off of Terre View as that is a common area
               for people to park when they go to walk their dogs. I responded
               to the WSU Wild Ungulate Facility to contact the reporting
               party, Alexandra L. Prosken. As I was approaching the WSU Wild
               Ungulate Facility, Officer Olmstead said there was a Subaru
               Outback (ANY6001) parked near the entrance to the USDA
               Property. He asked Whitcom to see if there vehicle was in
               Spillman and to attempt to locate a phone number for the
               vehicle's owner. Whitcom was able to identify the vehicle's
               Registered Owner as Marie Glynn (08-29-53). Just after they
               relayed the information to Officer Olmstead, Glynn arrived at
               her car. Officer Olmstead saw two hunting dogs with Glynn and
               asked her if her dogs were near the WSU Wild Ungulate Facility.
               She said she was snow shoeing and did not realize dogs were not
               allowed to be in the area without being on a leash. She said
               she called her dogs back to her as soon as she realized they
               were barking at the animals in the WSU Wild Ungulate Facility.
               Glynn said she would find another place to snow shoe. I made
               contact with Prosken and informed her we made contact with the
               owner of the dogs. She thanked us for helping. Nothing further.
               I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws
               of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 26th day of December, 2015, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer J.
