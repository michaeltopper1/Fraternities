    Narrative: RVWD: 316 / OFC: mjp/327 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W6637 SYNOPSIS: Elevator alarm. No one
               stuck but elevator responding erratically. Fac Ops notified.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 123015
               at approximately 1550 hours dispatch was notified of an
               elevator alarm in Orton Hall. When I came on duty at 1600 hours
               I was assigned the call. I responded and found no one in the
               elevator, however, the elevator #2, would not respond
               immediately, and take a significant amount of time to begin
               moving. The elevator tech's vehicle was parked outside so I
               called Fac Ops and asked them to follow up with them in case
               they were currently working on it. I cleared. Nothing follows.
               I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws
               of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 31st day of December, 2015, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer
