               about 1253 hrs I was dispatched to an agency assist for the

               vehicles has slid off the roadway on Pullman Airport Road at

               observed a red, 2000 Nissan Pathfinder (ID Lic. 1LC3288) off
               the roadway and in the ditch. I contacted Austin A. Bates (DOB
               04-16-1988) near the vehicle. Bates advised that his girlfriend
               had been driving the vehicle to work earlier today, lost
               control on the ice, and slid off the roadway into the ditch.
               His girlfriend was identified as Ashley S. Olzendam (DOB 06-15-

               scene and removed the vehicle from the ditch without incident.
               There was no damage to the vehicle or to any other property in
               the area. I cleared the scene. No further action at this time.
