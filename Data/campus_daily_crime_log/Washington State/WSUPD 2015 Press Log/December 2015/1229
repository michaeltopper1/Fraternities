               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W6633 NARRATIVE: On 122915 at
               approximately 1900 hours, I was dispatched to a report of
               suspicious noises coming from the painting room in Fine Arts
               7th floor. Upon arrival, I contacted Iolanda Palmer who told me
               she was working in her office and hear sounds like a hammer was
               hitting a metal pipe in the painting rooms on the 7th floor. I
               walked to the 7th floor and checked the painting rooms and
               there was nobody in the rooms. I noticed the heater vents were
               active and noisy. I explained to Palmer that in the older
               buildings on campus, when the heaters kick on there is often a
               loud clanking sound that comes from the vents and it was likely
               that. She thanked me for checking on the noises and I cleared.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 29th day of December, 2015, in
               Pullman, Washington. _______________________________________
