               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W6363 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched
               to a report of a hit and run vehicle collision. A concrete
               bollard was damaged at Carpenter Hall. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 12-11-2015 at about 0747 hrs I
               was dispatched to a report of a hit and run vehicle collision
               at the loading dock of Carpenter Hall, located at 250 NE
               Spokane Street. Dispatch advised that a concrete bollard was
               damaged. I arrived on scene and located the damaged concrete
               bollard on the south side the building near the loading dock.
               The bollard had been knocked over, and the base of the bollard
               (a pipe sticking up from the ground) was broken. I examined the
               bollard and found several fresh scratch marks near the top. It
               appears that something (possibly a large truck) hit the bollard
               and knocked it over. There was no paint transfer. The damage
               occurred sometime between 0600 hrs and 0730 hrs on 12-11-2015
               and is estimated to be $200.00. I photographed the scene, and
               the photographs were downloaded into Spillman and attached to
               this case. No suspects or leads were identified. No further
               action at this time. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this _11__ day of

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W6368 12/11/15 SYNOPSIS: Harassment from
               a current student towards a professor. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On December 11, 2015 I was asked
               by Lt. Larsen to investigate a report of harassment involving a
               student and a professor. He had received the notice of
               harassment from Adam Jussel, Assistant Dean of Students, WSU
               Student Conduct. I contacted Carrie Cuttler, Clinical Assistant
               Professor, College of Arts and Sciences, Department of
               Psychology by telephone. Cuttler told me a student named Thomas
               Fossedal was harassing her. Fossedal is in Cuttler's Abnormal
               Psychology class on personality disorders. The incident began
               on Tuesday, December 8, 2015 during lecture. Cuttler was
               lecturing about narcissistic personality disorders and
               referenced Donald Trump as an example of narcissism. Cuttler
               also spoke about her sister and gave examples of her sister in
               relation to histrionic personality disorder. Cuttler said it is
               common practice to use personal references to the topics she is
               lecturing about. Cuttler thought her sister's information was
               not available on the world wide web. In addition Cuttler
               thought her social media settings were set to private. She
               later learned that her Facebook account was not completely set
               to private. Sometime soon after this lecture either on Tuesday,
               December 8, 2015 or Wednesday, December 9, 2015, Cuttler's
               sister, "Amy", was sent a message via Facebook messenger. It is
               unknown who sent the message. The content of the message
               describes the narcissistic and histrionic personality disorder
               lecture including examples of Amy. Included in the message was
               a statement about having "free time and spite for Carrie".
               Cuttler's sister texted her the message. I do not have the
               original Facebook messenger message. Cuttler told me the
               messages are no longer on her sister's account. According to
               Cuttler the message was damaging to her relationship with her
               sister. On Thursday, December 10, 2015 Cuttler instructed her
               Abnormal Psychology class. Upset and crying, Cuttler told the
               class about the message. According to Cuttler, three (3)
               unknown students, identified Thomas Fossedal as the person who
               sent the message. Apparently Fossedal was bragging about the
               message. One of the students saw Fossedal on Facebook once
               Cuttler left the classroom on Thursday. Cuttler said Fossedal
               was bragging about what he had done. Cuttler said Fossedal was
               laughing in class when she broke down. Cuttler believes
               Fossedal is out to "hurt her." She talked about how Fossedal
               was a former WSU Football player. She told me she doesn't feel

               safe on campus and will not be back until January 2016. Cuttler
               will not be proctoring the final exam for the class next week.
               Someone from her department will be filling in for her. Cuttler
               went on to tell me that her class knows she has a child and
               where the child attends school. Cuttler is concerned that
               Fossedal will attempt to harm her or her family. I asked
               Cuttler if any threats of violence have been made against her
               or her family. She told me no threats were made. I asked
               Cuttler how many messages were sent to her or her sister. She
               thought only the one single message was sent to her sister. No
               messages were sent directly to her. Cuttler has reported the
               incident to WSU Dean of Students as well as WSU Student
               Conduct. The Psychology Department Chair is also aware of the
               incident. I asked Cuttler to send me an email statement and to
               please forward on the message sent to her sister. I received
               the following email statement from Cuttler on December 11, 2015
               which has been attached to the case: From: Cuttler, Carrie
               Sent: Friday, December 11, 2015 12:37 PM To: Jones, Darren
               Matthew Subject: Thomas Fossedal Dear Officer Jones, Thank you
               for taking the time to call me today. On Tuesday December 8th I
               gave a lecture to my Abnormal Psychology class on personality
               disorders, including narcissistic personality disorder and
               histrionic personality disorder. I used an image on a slide
               about narcissistic personality disorder of Donald Trump because
               he is a classic, commonly used example of narcissim. I also
               used some examples of some of my sister's behaviors to
               illustrate traits of histrionic personality disorder. One of
               the traits of this disorder is that individuals will engage in
               inappropriate flirtatious behavior. I used an example of my
               sister behaving flirtatiously with me and my uncle (not a blood
               relative) to illustrate how the behavior can occur even when
               the individual is not sexually attracted to the other person
               and that what underlies the behavior is a need for attention. I
               also said that my sister posts inappropriate pictures of
               herself on Facebook with "everything hanging out" and even my
               mother has made comments like "you're grounded" in response to
               them. This was of course just meant to be a bit humorous. Many
               of my colleagues also use their family members as examples in
               their classes but Thomas clearly felt this was inappropriate
               and unprofessional (my other students do not share these
               feelings). I assumed my sister was anonymous (she has a
               different last name and lives in another country) so there was
               no harm in my comments. I also thought I had everything set to
               private on my own personal Facebook account. But my
               relationship status with her was not private and Thomas found
               her and sent her the following message through Facebook
               messenger: "Hello Amy, I'm writing you in response to an
               offensive lecture given by Carrie Cutler as WSU. Today Carrie
               lectured on personality disorders diagnosis, and she repeatedly
               mentioned her 'attention hungry' sister and uncle. At multiple
               points in her lecture, she actually said her sister flirts with
               her Uncle. I thought to myself hmm... Sounds to me like this
               Uncle and sister are really awesome and somebody else might
               just be jealous. Carrie continued to relate her negative
               opinions concerning clinical diagnosis to a presidential

               candidate which many people may have found offensive, Carrie's
               personal opinions certainly have no place within her
               'professional' lectures. Towards the end of her lecture she
               continued to reference her attention hungry sister, and in
               doing so Carrie described a facebook picture in which "her
               boobs were hanging out", in which her Mom comments: "You're
               grounded". I immediately thougt hmm... Her sister must be
               attractive and she's probably just jealous. Anyways, I have
               enough free time and spite for Carrie, given her offensive
               expressions, that I decided to pursue this topic. Sure enough I
               was able to find some of her relatives on facebook, and only
               one photo caught my eye, so I clicked on it, and sure enough, I
               saw the salty comment as described by Carrie in my lecture
               "you're grounded". I also realized wow her sister is pretty and
               she's probably just jealous of her attention. Anyways it was
               evident that Carrie had enough time and energy to go out of her
               way to negatively describe you, and your Uncle, within what
               should have been a professional lecture. So I ask you...
               Anything interesting Carrie's students should know about her?
               And thanks for your time." My sister sent me this as a text
               message. Clearly Thomas has committed this vicious act against
               me in order to try to destroy my relationship with a family
               member. I believe that he created a fake Facebook account to do
               this. That is because the message no longer appears on my
               sisters messenger account. I also looked at the source code to
               find out who had been on my Facebook page and found several
               broken links (I assume these are deleted accounts). On Thursday
               I went to class to inform them of what had happened. In doing
               so I was extremely upset and was crying. I implored my students
               to come forward to help me identify who committed this act of
               cyber relational bullying against me. Three students contacted
               me to inform me that it was Thomas Fossedal. Two students gave
               me his name. One of these two informed me that he approached
               her after her Women Studies class to brag about doing it. The
               third student gave a description of his appearance and said
               that he saw this individual go onto Facebook right after I left
               the class (around 10:45am on Thursday December 10th) and brag
               about what he had done. I sent the student a picture of Thomas
               and he confirmed that it was him. Thomas' actions have
               permanently damaged my relationship with my sister and some of
               the comments in his message concern me. Specifically, "Anyways,
               I have enough free time and spite for Carrie, given her
               offensive expressions, that I decided to pursue this topic."
               and "So I ask you...Anything interesting Carrie's students
               should know about her?" He is clearly out to hurt me. The fact
               that he is bragging about it to other students and that he
               laughed in response to my breakdown in my class suggests to me
               that lacks empathy and lacks remorse. The act of sending the
               email was clearly antisocial. These are all traits of
               antisocial personality disorder (which I lectured about in a
               recent class that Thomas was in) and psychopathy. TI have
               professional experience with psychopaths so this possibility
               terrifies me. Thomas is also a former WSU football player which
               suggests he is strong and potentially aggressive (I mean no
               disrespect against our WSU Football team or players here but

               returning to campus until the New Year. I am concerned that
               Thomas will attempt to harm me or a family member. I have a 3
               year old in the Montessori preschool and some of my students
               know my son attends that school. I have warned the director of
               that school and asked her to be on the look out. Thank you for

               dented/broken $500.00 WITNESS(ES): Kaylie Henry, passenger in
               vehicle #2. NARRATIVE: On December 11, 2015 at about 1413 hours
               I was dispatched to a two vehicle non injury collision on
               Grimes Way. The complainant requested telephone contact as the
               incident had already occurred and the parties had left the
               scene. I called Jacob M. Sadoian (05/26/94) as requested.
               Sadoian told me he had been involved in a collision earlier in
               the day at about 1345 hours. He exchanged information with the
               other driver while on scene. Per his insurance company he was
               tole to report the collision to police for a case number.
               Sadoian said he was stopped in the roadway on Grimes Way next
               to the Lighty Building waiting for a vehicle to back out of an
               angled parking space. The correct street location is actually
               Wilson Road as their is no street parking next to Lighty on
               Grimes Way. Sadoian said as he was stopped in the roadway
               waiting for the vehicle to back out a truck began to back out
               of another angled parking space next to his car. The truck
               slowly backed out and hit his vehicle on the passenger door.
               Sadoian honked his horn. The truck stopped, drove back into the
               parking space and then backed up a second time striking his
               vehicle again in the driver's door. Sadoian and his passenger
               made contact with the female driver of the truck. He said she
               was "confused and it was a big truck." They exchanged
               information and cleared the scene. I gave Sadoian a case number
               for insurance purposes. I did not view the vehicles as I spoke
               to him on the telephone after the incident. No further
               investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 11th day of December, 2015 in

               was dispatched to the odor of marijuana in Stephenson South
               room 1123. There were no prior contacts in that room this
               semester, nor had the residents been contacted. I responded and
               met with the reporting party, Justeen Montelongo, in the
               hallway by the elevators. Two males began walking towards us
               and Justeen said the males came from the room. I asked the two
               males (identified as Timothy Martinez & Antonio Abonza) if they
               came from room 1123 and they said they didn't know. I asked
               who's room they were in and they said Kylie's. I asked them to
               come back to the room with me, which they did. As I walked
               behind them I could smell the odor of burning marijuana coming
               off of them. I knocked on the door to room 1123 and a female
               answered the door, later identified as Kylie Serl. When the
               door opened I could smell the odor of burning marijuana
               emitting from inside. I told Serl I was there for the odor of
               marijuana. There was another female (Serl's roommate) present
               and she was identified as Ishana S. Trivedi. I told Serl and
               Trivedi to collect the marijuana and smoking device from the
               room. Serl went into the room and collected a glass jar which
               contained marijuana and a joint. Serl also collected a metal
               pipe. I asked if all four were smoking and they said they were.
               I saw two empty alcohol bottles on the floor so I told them to
               collect any alcohol in the room. Trevedi went to the
               refrigerator and collected two bottles of alcohol. Trevedi and
               an RA went to the restroom and Trevedi poured the contents of
               one bottle in the sink. The other bottle was a corked wine
               bottle and they did not have a wine opener. I walked with
               Trevedi and Serl to the dumpster outside where they threw away
               the marijuana, pipe, the wine bottle and the other empty
               bottle. I told them the case would be sent to student conduct.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 12th day of December, 2015, in

               children. I asked if someone had call 911 and the female

               English and she said very little. I asked if there as an
               emergency and she shook her head no. All four seemed in good

               the dumpster and destroy the items. I told Maasberg regardless

               Alvarez Lucatero. There was another male present in the room,
               identified as Gustavo A. Mendoza Cid. I asked Jesus if he knew
               why I was there and he said because his music was too loud. I
               told him I didn't come for noise, but for a smell. Jesus said
               he still didn't know. I told Jesus his room smelled like
               marijuana. I asked Jesus how much marijuana was in his room and
               he said none. I told Jesus he was lying to me and there was two
               ways the call could be handled. I told Jesus the call could be
               referred to student conduct, or it could become criminal in
               nature. I told Jesus if he gathered his marijuana and smoking
               device we would throw it away and the case would be referred to
               student conduct. Jesus went and gathered a small amount of
               marijuana and two glass stems. I asked Jesus if I were to
               search his room would I find anything else illegal and he said
               no. I asked Jesus if I could and he said no. I told Jesus that
               makes me believe he still had illegal items in his room and he
               said no, and that he just didn't want me in his room. I walked
               with Jesus to the dumpster outside where he threw the items
               away. I told Jesus if we were called to his room again for the
               odor of marijuana, we would get a search warrant and he would
               be arrested. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 12th day of

               yelling at pedestrians as they walked by. As I arrived on
               scene, dispatch stated the reporting party just watched the
               male walk into Northside Hall. I spoke with a male who was
               walking his dogs who stated he saw the male who was yelling.

               Alcohol Offense NARRATIVE: ON 12-12-15 I was dispatched to
               Goldsworthy Hall on near the elevator for a alcohol offense.
               Upon my arrival I contacted the on call RED She was standing
               next to a male, later identified as Joshua Smith. The two were
               in a heated conversation. I asked the RED to explain what was
               going on. She said that Smith and another male, later
               identified as Anthony Say. were walking around the hall with
               open alcoholic beverages. The two are over 21 years of age, but
               it is against housing rules to have open containers in the
               common areas of the hall. When she confronted the two they
               became belligerent and told her to mind her own business. When
               she identified herself as hall staff Say ran away. I spoke with
               Smith and told him why I was there. he said he didn't know that
               the person he was talking to was hall staff. He was a little
               more cooperative with me but still denying doing anything
               wrong. I asked him where Say was and he said he was up on the
               4th floor. We went to the 4th floor and I knocked on Say;'s
               door. He answered and I told him why I was there. He was very
               argumentative and denied doing anything wrong. I explain to him
               that even though he was over 21 he could not have an open
               container of alcohol in the common areas of the hall. I added
               that when he was contacted by hall staff he was a disrespectful
               and belligerent. He said he didn't realize she was hall staff.
               When he did he left the area. The whole time I was talking to
               Smith and Say they were very loud and trying to speak over me.
               At one point Say said he didn't care he was graduation tomorrow
               and could give a fuck. I told the two I was referring both to
               student conduct and their hall director. They both said they
               understood and I left the area. Before I left the hall I was
               called back by the on call R/a to deal with the two again. See

               left the floor and Say went back into his room. Sgt Kuhrt
               contacted Smith outside the hall. Smith said he was telling
               people to mind their own business, but decided he wanted a
               cigarette and went outside. When he left Say was in his room.
               Since Say was in his room Deleon and I decided to just leave

               traveling east on NE Valley Rd. behind the defendant's vehicle.
               I ran the plate on my MDC and it came back to two female
               registered owners, one of which was Sandra C. Santos Hernandez.
               I ran Hernandez's driving status and she returned DWLS 2nd. The
               vehicle turned left onto NE Brandi Way. As the vehicle turned
               into the Churchill Downs parking lot I activated my emergency
               lights. I contacted the driver and told her the stop was being
               recorded. I asked if the vehicle belonged to her and she said
               yes. I asked if she was Sandra and she said yes. I asked if she
               knew her license was suspended and she said no. The driver said
               she paid the tickets in October. I asked if she received any
               paperwork from DOL and she said no. I asked for her license and
               registration, which she provided. The driver was identified as
               Hernandez. I returned to my patrol car and issued Hernandez a
               SECTOR citation for DWLS 2nd. I returned to Hernandez and
               explained to her that she had the right to counsel and reminded
               her she was being audio and video recorded. I explained the
               ticket to Hernandez and provided her a copy. Hernandez did not
               have a valid driver in the car so I allowed her to park her
               vehicle in the stall she was stopped next to. I told Hernandez
               she was free to go. I certify and declare under penalty of

               at Wilmer Davis. The reporting party, Jered A. Newcomb
               01/06/92, who works for dining services, called stating he saw
               several people on the roof of Wilmer Davis. I responded to the
               area and contacted Newcomb who stated he saw several people on
               the stairwell on the southside of the building that leads to a
               flat portion of the roof. Newcomb yelled to the people and told
               them they were not allowed to be up there. Newcomb stated he
               saw the people run back up the staircase and disappear. I went
               to the roof area Newcomb had described and saw a set of wet
               footprints coming from one of the rooms. I knocked on the
               window but it appeared that the occupants were asleep. I
               checked the surrounding area and did not find any damage or
               signs of illegal activity. All the rooms on the second floor of
               the southside have windows that make it very easy to step out
               onto the roof. I walked through Southside Cafe and found it to
               be secure and nobody inside. I checked all the doors and made
               sure they were locked and cleared. END OF REPORT I certify and

               a subject who did not show up at work. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On December 12, 2015 at about
               0611 hours I was dispatched to a welfare check at Yakima
               Village Apartment 636 for a subject who did not show up at work
               this morning. I responded to the apartment. I made contact with
               the female employee. She said she was sick and had told her
               employer yesterday that she was sick. The female said she will
               call her employer immediately. This appeared to have been a
               miscommunication between the parties. No emergency found. No
               further investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 12th day of December,
