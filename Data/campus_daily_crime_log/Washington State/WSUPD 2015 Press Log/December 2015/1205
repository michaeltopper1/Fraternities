               were identified. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 12-05-2015 at about 1113 hrs I was dispatched to
               a report of a theft in Streit Hall, located at 1620 NE Cougar
               Way. I contacted the victim, Preet K. McNary (DOB 05-19-1997),
               on the telephone. McNary resides at Streit Hall #509. McNary
               said on 12-04-2015 at about 2100 hrs she locked the door to her
               residence hall room and placed the key to her room on the ledge
               above the door. McNary returned to her room on 12-05-2015 at
               about 0300 hrs and discovered that the key she had hidden on
               the ledge above her door was gone. The value of the key was
               estimated to be $5.00. McNary said the door to her room was
               locked. With the assistance of hall staff, McNary entered her
               room and discovered that someone had stolen money from her
               wallet. McNary said her wallet had been on her desk and
               contained $150.00 in United States Currency. McNary did not
               know the denomination of the bills but thought they were a
               "mixture of everything". McNary's roommate was not around and
               was not in the room during the time frame when the theft
               occurred. McNary had no idea who might have stolen the key and
               money. No suspects or leads were identified. No further action
               at this time. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under penalty

    Narrative: RVWD: AE/330 OFC: JAK/333 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W6236 SYNOPSIS: Contacted a WSU male
               student at his residence. He voluntarily took a water bong and
               glass container of marijuana to the dumpster and threw them
               away. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               12-05-15, at approximately 1332 hours, Whitcom assigned me a
               Drugs call at Orton Hall, room 827. Britteny L. Alspach (the
               WSU "On Call" RED) called Whitcom stating there was an odor of
               marijuana emitting from within room 827, in Orton Hall. Officer
               Olmstead and I responded to Orton Hall, and to the 8th floor.
               When we arrived on the 8th floor, Alspach was waiting in the
               floor lobby for us. She said she smelled the odor of marijuana
               emitting from within room 827. I asked if hall staff has had
               issues with the resident of the room and she said no. She
               opened to door which leads to the hallway from the lobby and I
               could immediately smell the odor of marijuana. I walked down
               the hallway and the odor of marijuana became stronger. As I
               approached the door to room 827, the odor of marijuana became
               very strong. I walked further down the hallway and the odor
               became weaker. I came back to the door to room 827 and placed
               my nose in the crack of the door. The odor of marijuana became
               very strong. I knocked on the door and could see movement from
               inside, through the peep hole of the door. A male opened the
               door. When the door opened, the odor of marijuana became
               extremely strong. I asked the male if he knew why I was at his
               door and he said he did not. I explained I had been a Police
               Officer for over 16 years and again asked him if he knew why I
               was there. He again said he did not know. I asked him what the
               odor I was smelling from within his room was and he said he did
               not know. I told him he either had fresh marijuana in his room
               or he had recently smoked it in his room. He said he had no
               idea what I was talking about. I explained it wasn't the worst
               crime in the world and asked him to just cooperate with me. He
               again said he didn't know what I was talking about. I asked if
               he would have a problem with me entering his room to search it
               if he had nothing to hide and he said I could not enter his
               room. I asked him if he had ID so I could know who I was
               talking with. He said something to the effect of "Sure, just a
               minute" and tried closing the door to go back in his room to
               get his ID. Officer Olmstead put his hand out and told the male
               to keep his door open. As the male walked further into his
               room, his room door opened further. I could see a yellow multi-
               colored water bong and a glass container of what appeared to be
               marijuana sitting on top of a table in the room. The male

               brought his Washington State Driver's License to me and I asked
               Officer Olmstead to "Run" the name. The male was identified as
               Christopher J. Roe (05-04-93). I again told Roe that marijuana
               on campus was not the biggest crime in the world and explained
               it wasn't even technically against the law for him to possess
               as he was over 21 years of age. I did advise him it was against
               his WSU housing policy though. I told him I would be completing
               a Police report and forwarding it to the WSU Office of Student
               Standards and Accountability for their review. I then asked
               Alspach if she had anything to say to him. Alspach explained he
               was not allowed to keep marijuana or drug paraphernalia in a
               residence hall room and told him he would need to either take
               the items off campus or throw them away immediately. Roe
               decided he would take the items to the dumpster. We all walked
               down to the dumpster and I watch Roe throw the water bong and
               glass container with less than 1/2 or a gram of marijuana away.
               We cleared. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 5th day of December, 2015, in

               called Whitcom wanting to inquire about security for a talent
               show and dance. I called Sinapati and asked what I could answer
               for him. He said he works for WSU Student Involvement and is in
               charge of the "Vibes" conference at WSU this weekend. He said
               the conference is ending this evening, culminating in a talent
               show and dance. These will be held in the CUB Senior Ballroom
               this evening (12-05-15), from 1800 hours until 2300 hours.
               Sinapati asked about hiring security and I told him it would be
               too late to get the approval for this evening. He said he
               wasn't speaking of the "Vibes" conference, rather curious for
               future events. He said he had other WSU students in place as
               security for this evening's events. I advised him he could come
               by the Police Department or call during business hours to get
               more information about hiring security for future events.

               stated that there was a strong odor of marijuana coming from
               the door of the room. I went to the room and as I approached I
               could smell the odor coming from the door. I knocked on the
               door and Marc Marcus answered. It was very apparent that Marcus
               is over 21 years of age. I got a large blast of air from the
               room and the odor was even stronger. I told Marcus why I was
               there and he said he had marijuana in the room, but hadn't
               smoked it in the room. I asked where he smoked it and he said
               just outside the door. I spoke with him for several minutes
               about the Washington State laws concerning smoking marijuana in
               the public and on campus. He said he understood and asked what
               he needed to do. I told him that since he was over 21 years of
               age and it was legal for him to posses it I could not request
               him to do anything with it, But Hall staff could request him
               destroy all the marijuana and paraphernalia. Alspach was
               standing behind me and told Marcus he needed to destroy all
               marijuana and paraphernalia. He said he would. He came out of
               the room with a box containing a pipe and some marijuana. He
               threw the items in the dumpster. I told him I was going to
               refer him to student conduct and he returned to his room.
               Nothing further............ I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 5th day of December,

               at 1395 SE Stadium Way. Dispatch advised the female was
               breathing normally, but not completely alert. I arrived on
               scene. There was a group of individuals standing around the
               female laying on the ground. I asked if any of them knew her,
               and they all said no. I began talking to the female laying on
               the ground, and she said "hello". I asked her what her name
               was, and she replied "Elaine Adams", Elaine F. Adams (DOB 12-
               16-96). I told Adams that medics were on the way. I asked her

               a male and female arguing near Sloan Hall. Both parties will be
               referred to student conduct. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Lauren R. Labrosse 02/10/94 Student Conduct
               Suspect/Assault 2. Drew A. Peters 06/11/94 Student Conduct
               Victim/Assault NARRATIVE: On 12/06/15 at approximately 0157
               hours, Cougar Security units called out that there was a male
               and female arguing near Sloan Hall on Spokane Street. While en
               route, Cougar Security stated it looked like the argument was
               turning physical. Sgt. Kuhrt responded to the Spokane side of
               Sloan and I responded to the Oak side. Sgt. Kuhrt radioed that
               he could see the two passing the arch heading my way. When I
               reached Oak St near the President's Mansion I saw the two
               walking towards me. I told the two to stop and they did so. The
               female, Lauren Renee Labrosse 02/10/94 was visibly agitated.
               The male, Drew Anthony Peters 06/11/94 appeared to be much
               calmer. I asked the two what was going on and Labrosse said
               they were just arguing. About this time Sgt. Kuhrt arrived on
               scene and I had Labrosse talk with him while I interviewed
               Peters. I asked Peters what was going on. Peters said Labrosse
               and he were at a party when a female began to flirt with him
               and Labrosse became jealous which caused an argument. I asked
               Peters how long he has been dating Labrosse and he said about
               two years. I asked if at any point was he hit, punched, pushed,
               or struck. Peters said no. I asked if at any point did he hit,
               punch, push, or strike Labrosse. Peters said no. I told Peters
               that Cougar Security had witnessed Labrosse ramming her chest
               into his during the argument. Peters said Labrosse did however
               it did not hurt. Peters stated he did not want any charges
               pressed. I asked Peters if he was injured and he said no. After
               Sgt. Kuhrt was done with his interview it was concluded that
               the chest bumping was the only physical contact to the verbal
               argument. Both parties were told that this case would be
               referred to student conduct. Labrosse stated she wanted to
               leave and she was told she was free to go. I provided Peters
               with an ATVP packet with his case number. Peters said he and
               Labrosse did not live together and they would each be staying
               at their own apartments. Peters was told he was free to go and
               all units cleared. END OF REPORT I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 6th day of

               DEPARTMENT CASE #:15-W6249 SYNOPSIS: Subject processed, cited

               Consuming Alcohol. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               Emily M. Vernik 04/19/96 Cited MOMVACA C09971 2. NARRATIVE: On
               12/06/15 at approximately 0235 hours I was traveling east on NE
               Cougar Way approaching Stadium Way. I noticed the vehicle in
               front of mine was stopped at the intersection for the red
               light. I saw the passenger's side brake light was not
               illuminated while the other brake lights were. The vehicle
               turned left onto Stadium Way and I activated my emergency
               lights. As the vehicle came to a stop at Lower Dr. the back
               passenger tire drove over the curb. I exited my patrol car and
               contacted the driver, telling her the stop was being recorded
               as well as the reason for the stop. I asked the driver for her
               license, registration, and proof of insurance, which she
               provided. The driver was identified as Emily M. Vernik
               04/19/96. While standing at the car I could smell the odor of
               intoxicants emitting from the vehicle. I asked Vernik how much
               she had to drink. Vernik said she had a few drinks between 6 PM
               and 11 PM. I asked Vernik if I could check her eyes and she
               said I could. I administered an HGN test with Vernik seated in
               the car. I saw a lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes. I noticed
               Vernik's eyes were bloodshot and watery. Ofc. Westerman arrived
               on scene around this time. I asked Vernik if she would provide
               a breath sample and she said she would. I explained to Vernik
               the test was voluntary and did not replace the evidentiary
               breath test. Vernik provided a PBT sample (FST #16805) of .055.
               While waiting for the results I explained to Vernik I would not
               arrest her if the sample was below a .04. Vernik had previously
               told me she was headed to pick someone up, so I told her to
               contact her friend and let him know she would not be picking
               him up. I told Vernik I intended to arrest her for Minor
               Operating a Motor Vehicle After Consuming Alcohol. Vernik sent
               the subject a text message since he wasn't answering his phone.
               I asked Vernik to exit the vehicle, which she did. I told
               Vernik she was under arrest for Minor Operating a Motor Vehicle
               After Consuming Alcohol. I handcuffed (D/L) Vernik and advised
               her of her right to counsel. I reminded Vernik she was being
               audio and video recorded. I searched Vernik incident to arrest,
               finding no weapons or items of evidence. I placed Vernik in the
               back seat of my patrol car. Ofc. Westerman parked Vernik's
               vehicle in the lot behind the Presbyterian church per her
               request. I transported Vernik to Pullman PD for the BAC. Upon

               arrival I checked the Draeger and found it working properly
               with the mouth tube warm to the touch. I checked Vernik's mouth
               at 0256 hours, finding no foreign substance. I read Vernik her
               Constitutional Rights at 0257 hours. Vernik said she understood
               her rights and signed both signature blocks. I read Vernik her
               Implied Consent for Breath at 0259 hours. Vernik signed that it
               was read to her. I asked Vernik if she would provide a breath
               sample. Vernik checked the "yes" box and initialed next to it.
               Vernik provided a breath sample of .055 IR / .057 EC at 0316
               hours and a sample of .053 IR / .054 EC at 0319 hours. The
               breath test was administered in accordance to the methods
               approved by the Washington State Toxicologist pursuant to the
               Washington Administrative Code. I provided Vernik with a copy
               of the following documents: Driver's hearing request, Notice of
               Hearing/Conditions of Release, and the Breath Test Document. I
               issued Vernik a criminal citation for Minor Operating a Motor
               Vehicle After Consuming Alcohol. I explained the citation to
               Vernik and provided her a copy. I released Vernik from custody
               and provided her a courtesy transport home. Vernik was
               extremely polite and cooperative during my contact with her.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 6th day of December, 2015, in
               Pullman, Washington. _______________________________________
