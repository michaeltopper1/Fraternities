               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W6526 SYNOPSIS: Subject reported
               residents of Northside Hall were unloading their car. When they
               returned there was a pocket knife on the ground near their
               vehicle. Officer responded and knife has been placed into the
               lost and found. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 12-17-15 at approximately 2114 hours I was
               dispatched to the report of found property outside of Northside
               Residence Hall, located at 1590 NE Cougar Way. Dispatch advised
               the complainant, William D. Stratmeyer (DOB 12-07-95), said a
               couple of residents had been unloading their car. When they
               returned to their vehicle a few minutes later there was a
               pocket knife laying on the ground near their vehicle. I arrived
               on scene. Stratmeyer met me outside of Northside Residence
               Hall. He handed me a black in color SOG pocket knife. I
               estimated the value of the knife to be $50.00. He told me the
               two residents that found it were in the lobby. I went inside
               and contacted two females who were identified as Sarah A.
               Stavig (DOB 05-24-97) and Regyn M. Gaffney (DOB 02-24-97).
               Stavig told me her and Gaffney were loading her vehicle that
               was parked right outside Northside Hall at about 2100 hours.
               She said they went back inside to grab a couple more bags, and
               when they returned around 2105 hours there was a pocket knife
               flipped open on the ground right behind her vehicle. Both
               Stavig and Gaffney said the pocket knife had not been there
               before. They told me they ran inside because they were scared
               because of the knife and thought someone may have been inside
               of their vehicle because their doors were left unlocked. I
               walked outside and looked at Stavig's silver, 2011 Volkswagen
               Jetta (WA Lic. AFK2261). There was nobody inside of the vehicle
               or the trunk. They checked all their belongings and said
               nothing appeared to be missing, and it did not look like anyone
               had been inside. I checked the tires and they were all
               inflated. I asked if they remember seeing anyone near their
               vehicle who may have dropped their knife, and they said no. The
               ground was covered in snow and it was very windy. There were
               multiple students who had been packing up their vehicles
               outside of Northside Hall. I cleared the scene. The pocket
               knife was later logged into evidence. No further action. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 18th day of December, 2015, in Pullman,

               St. Officer assisted others in pushing the vehicle out of the
               snow. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               12-17-15 at approximately 2145 hours I was on patrol on Cougar
               Way, when I observed a blue, 2015 Ford Focus (OR Lic. 989HPF)
               that was stuck in the road partially blocking the eastbound
               lane of traffic. I saw multiple individuals trying to push the
               vehicle out for the driver. The vehicle was a Zipcar, and the
               driver was trying to park it in the stalls designated for the
               Zipcar's off of Cougar Way near the Holland and Terrell parking
               garage. The driver was later identifed as Savannah M. Williams
               (DOB 01-15-97), by her WA driver's license. I assisted pushing
               the vehicle and it eventually became free from the snow. I told
               Williams she was not going to be able to drive it up to the
               parking stalls due to the steep hill. Williams was able to turn
               around and park the Zipcar in a parking stall off of Cougar
               Way. I cleared the scene. No further action. My Vievu camera
               was activated, and the video was later downloaded into the
               permanent digital evidence folder. I certify and declare under

               approximately 0032 hours I was dispatched to a drugs call at

               Cloe Soul Chin 09/23/96 answered the door. As soon as Chin
               opened the door I could smell the strong odor of burnt
               marijuana coming from the room. Also the room was smokey. Also
               in the room was Chui Yau Patricia Ho 08/05/97 and Joseph Daniel
               Mulvihill 02/20/93. I explained why I was called to Chin's room
               and told her as long as she was willing to turn over all her
               marijuana and smoking devices, we would go to the dumpster and
               destroy the illegal items. I told Chin that she would only be
               referred to student conduct. Chin agreed and retrieved a small
               container with approximately one gram of marijuana in it. I
               asked what they had been smoking the marijuana with and Chin
               said a blunt. I asked where the blunt was and Chin said they
               threw it out the window when I knocked on the door. Chin is the
               sole occupant of room 156. Ho lives in room 153 of Regents and
               Mulvihill does not attend WSU. Chin and I walked to the
               dumpster where she destroyed her illegal items. I explained the
               student conduct process to Chin and told her she was free to
               go. END OF REPORT I certify and declare under penalty of

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: DBT/321 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W6533 SYNOPSIS: Subject reported a group
               of four or five people throwing snowballs off of Global
               Scholars Hall at pedestrians and vehicles. Officers responded
               and were unable to locate the individuals throwing the
               snowballs. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 12-18-15 at approximately 0102 hours I was
               dispatched to the report of a group of individuals on the
               rooftop of Global Scholars Hall throwing snowballs at
               pedestrians and vehicles, located at 1302 NE Cougar Way.
               Dispatch advised the complainant, Jered A. Newcomb (DOB 01-06-
               92), said the people throwing snowballs were all males.
               Dispatch said Newcomb was inside the Global Scholars Market for
               contact. Ofc. Westerman, Ofc. Whitman, and I arrived on scene.
               Ofc. Westerman drove around the westside of Global Scholars and
               said he saw a male with dark hair on the rooftop peaking over
               the edge. Ofc. Whitman walked through Global Scholars Hall. As
               I was walking to the entrance of Global Scholars, Newcomb came
               out of the market and contacted me. He told me four or five
               white males had been throwing snowballs at pedestrians,
               parked/moving vehicles, and other nearby objects. Newcomb
               walked me over to the southeast corner of Global Scholars and
               he pointed up and said the males were throwing the snowballs
               from there. He told me he yelled up at them to stop, but they
               ignored him and attempted to hit him with snowballs. Newcomb
               said he was never hit. I asked Newcomb if he would recognize
               any of the males if he saw them again, and he said no. I went
               inside of Global Scholars Hall. Ofc. Whitman and I walked
               around the balcony area of Global Scholars, but were unable to
               locate anyone in the area. We went into the Active Lounge #550
               and through the #550 B door which lead to the patio. There was
               a pile of snowballs and footprints in the area of where Newcomb
               saw the individuals. We cleared the scene. No suspects or leads
               at this time. My Vievu camera was activated, and the video was
               later uploaded into Spillman. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 18th day of
               December, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               Office asked for an AOA to check on a disabled vehicle on
               Airport Road near SR 270. Upon arrival I found a Whtie Audi A4
               that had been stuck in a snow drift. The Audi had been pulled
               out of the snow drift by a pickup truck prior to my arrival. I
               contacted the driver of the Audi Jessica Lance Foxe 05/12/95
               who said she was fine and had just got stuck in the large snow
               drift. The wind had caused a snow drift across the roadway
               approximately one foot deep. Dispatch advised the County Road
               Crew of the issue. Several large trucks drove through the snow
               drift breaking up a path through it. I drove the remainder of
               Airport Road and found it passable. END OF REPORT I certify and
