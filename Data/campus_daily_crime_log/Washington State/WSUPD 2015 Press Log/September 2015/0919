               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 09-19-15 at approximately 1607
               hours, I was advised of a Civil call and the RP was requesting
               phone contact. I called the RP, Adalya Browne, who stated she
               and her roommate had been having issues. She stated her
               roommate's mother had been confrontation the last time she was
               at the apartment and Adalya was wanting to know her options for
               when the roommate returns this weekend. She stated she was
               concerned because the family would be coming with her and she
               didn't want any further issues. Adalya stated she had been
               working with the apartment coordinator to set up a mediation
               between the two so a roommate agreement could be created. I
               advised Adalya to call when they arrived if she needed a civil
               standby. She stated had been trying to contact the roommate,
               Lauren, to find out what time she was returning and so they
               could set a meeting time with the coordinator. She requested I
               contact Lauren and I stated I would. I ended the call with
               Adalya and contacted Lauren. I advised Lauren why I was calling
               and she put me on speaker phone so her mother could also listen
               to the conversation. Both refused to say when they were
               returning to the apartment, but stated they had emailed the
               apartment coordinator to set up a time to meet on Tuesday at
               1600 hours. I spoke to them about making sure to keep any
               contact civil and to call if they needed any further assistance
               and they stated they would. About approximately 1650 hours, I
               was advised Lauren wanted to speak with me again. I called her
               and she stated Adalya had contacted her via text and stated the
               time would not work and there was a mandatory meeting set for
               Monday. Lauren felt the text was almost threatening in nature

               to contact her anymore. I told her I would and advised all
               communications should from now on probably go through the
               apartment coordinator and she agreed. I concluded the call. I
               contacted Adalya and spoke to her briefly and advised her it
               would be best to have all communications go through the
               apartment coordinator. She agreed and stated she would not
               contact Lauren again. She stated she would call us if she
               needed a civil standby. I cleared the call. An email will be

               T. Baldwin/031497 Cite/Release MIP Exhibiting 5Z0585679 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 09/19/15 at about 1646 hrs I was working at
               Martin Stadium near gate I for the WSU vs Wyoming football
               game. I was monitoring foot traffic entering the stadium when I
               noticed a male, later identified as Jacob T. Baldwin (031497),
               walking up the stairwell from Cougar Plaza. Baldwin caught my
               attention because he was having great difficulty walking,
               stumbling side to side and using others for balance. I
               contacted Baldwin outside gate I and asked how much he had to
               drink. He said, "A lot". I asked how old he was and he said,
               18. I asked for his driver's license, which he provided. His
               driver's license confirmed he was under 21. I asked what he was
               drinking and he said "advaka". I said, Vodka? and he said yes.
               I asked Baldwin if I could check his eyes and he agreed. I
               administered a horizontal gaze nystagmus on him and observed he
               had bloodshot and watery eyes, a lack of smooth pursuit, and an
               immediate onset of nystagmus in both eyes. I could smell the
               odor of intoxicants on his breath as I administered the test. I
               advised Baldwin he was under arrest for MIP Exhibiting and he
               was being recorded. I escorted Baldwin to the processing room,
               reading him his Constitutional Rights from a pre printed card
               along the way. I issued Baldwin criminal citation #5Z0585679
               and he received his copy. I read Baldwin a trespass warning and
               provided him with a copy. Baldwin provided a breath sample of
               .224 and was too intoxicated to let walk home alone. I had
               Baldwin call his roommate, who was not identified. His
               roommate, who appeared sober, met us at Cougar Plaza and took
               Baldwin home. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 21 day of

               Services saw a bulge in his waistband, which was a water bottle
               containing a clear liquid. The liquid had the strong odor of

               09-19-15 at approximately 1658 hours Ofc. Stewart, Deputy
               Kinonen, and I were on patrol in the area of the student plaza
               for the WSU Football game. Students were going through the
               lines and Crowd Management Services was checking for bottles,
               etc. on people and in bags. A male got up to the line and he
               had a large bulge in his waistband. The male, who was later
               identified as Ray A. Neevel (DOB 07-08-95), pulled out a water
               bottle from his waistband that was full with a clear liquid.
               Ofc. Stewart, Deputy Kinonen, and I walked over to the area and
               Crowd Management Services handed Ofc. Stewart the bottle.
               Neevel tried to say it just contained water. Ofc. Stewart
               unscrewed the cap and could smell the strong odor of
               intoxicants coming from the bottle. I told Neevel I was audio
               and video recording. Neevel asked if he was still allowed to go
               to the game, and Ofc. Stewart told him no because he was trying
               to bring alcohol inside the stadium. Neevel thought because we
               took his alcohol he should still be allowed in. Neevel
               continued to argue with Ofc. Stewart and told him they took
               alcohol from the guy in front of him, but he did not get an
               MIP. I asked him how much he had to drink today, and he said
               "not that much". I asked if he would be willing to take a
               voluntary PBT, and he shook his head no. Dispatch told me
               Neevel was contacted for Minor Exhibiting in January, 2015. I
               told him I was going to be forwarding charges on him for MIP to
               the Whitman County Prosecuting Attorney's Office. I also told
               him I would be referring him to WSU Student Conduct. Neevel
               went on to tell us how we are chasing kids away from wanting to
               attend WSU. I told him he was welcome to go to another school.
               He told me he has had multiple family members attend WSU since
               the 1930's. I escorted Neevel from the gates, and Ofc. Stewart
               told him if he returned he would get arrested for trespassing.
               We cleared the scene. Ofc. Petlovany later used his PBT to
               check the bottle to see if it contained alcohol, and it

               Lutovsky 12/21/95 Forwarded Charges MIP Exhibiting 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 09/19/15 at approximately 1715 hours I was
               working the WSU football game in Martin Stadium. I was near I
               Gate when I noticed Adam Riley Lutovsky 12/21/95 walking up the
               stairs from the student plaza. Lutovsky grabbed my attention
               because as he was walking Lutovsky was stumbling side to side.
               There were about 50 other people walking up the stairs and
               through the Gate at the same time. Lutovsky was stumbling to
               the point that he stood out amongst the crowd. As Lutovsky
               neared where I was standing I noticed Lutovsky appeared to be
               under the age of 21. Lutovsky also had a dazed appearance upon
               his face and had a 1000 yard stare. I contacted Lutovsky and
               told him I needed to talk to him. I walked Lutovsky away from
               the crowd and told him what I had observed. I asked Lutovsky
               how much he had to drink and Lutovsky said "one shot." I asked
               if Lutovsky had his ID and he provided me with his WADL that
               identified him as 19 years old. I asked Lutovsky if I could
               check his eyes and he said I could. I instructed Lutovsky to
               stand with his heels and toes together. I told Lutovsky to
               follow the tip of my pen with his eyes only. As soon as I moved
               the pen Lutovsky moved his head to follow. I reminded Lutovsky
               to only follow with his eyes. I attempted the test again
               however Lutovsky kept moving his head. I stopped the test after
               only a few passes because Lutovsky was swaying so much that he
               stumbled backwards. During the few passes I observed, equal
               pupil size, equal tracking, and lack of smooth pursuit. I could
               clearly smell the odor of intoxicants coming from Lutovsky's
               breath as he stood before me. I asked Lutovsky if he was
               willing to provide a voluntary PBT sample and Lutovsky said he
               would. I found my PBT (Alco-Sensor FST #16805) in working
               condition. Lutovsky provided a PBT sample of .154. I told
               Lutovsky that he was under arrest for MIP Exhibiting and
               handcuffed (D/L) him. I advised Lutovsky that he was being
               audio and video recorded. I walked Lutovsky to the processing
               room where I read him his Miranda Rights off my department
               issued card. Lutovsky stated he understood his rights. I told
               Lutovsky that I would be forwarding charges of MIP Exhibiting
               to the prosecutor and explained the process. I also read
               Lutovsky the ejection notice. I walked Lutovsky outside the
               stadium and released him from custody. Lutovsky walked home and

               On 091915 at approximately 1720 hours, I was working the WSU
               Footballl game in the Student Plaza area when I noticed a male
               subject staggering heavily and having a hard time maintaining
               his balance. He also appeared under the age of 21. I contacted
               the male later identified as Keegan R. Stone. I asked Stone to
               walk to the side of the entrance and talk to me. I activated my
               VieVu body camera and explained that he was too intoxicated to
               be in Martin Stadium for the WSU football game. Keegan's speech
               was heavily slurred and he was swaying back and forth while I
               spoke with him. He had a strong odor of intoxicants coming from
               his breath, he had bloodshot watery eyes, and a flushed face.
               WCSO Reserve Julian Kinonen asked Stone how much he had to
               drink and he told us he drank a couple beers and about a
               quarter of a bottle of vodka. I explained to Stone that he was
               being ejected from Martin Stadium and trespassed due to his
               extreme intoxication. I also explained that charges were being
               forwarded for MIP Exhibiting to Whitman County Prosecutors
               office and the Student Conduct office with WSU. Stone told me
               he understood. I escorted Stone out of the student plaza with
               his friend Eric L. Tuttle (102495) who told me he would care
               for Stone. I cleared shortly after. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 21st day of

               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W4306 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched
               to a report of an individual at the police department who
               needed assistance. The individual appeared to be exhibiting
               signs of mental illness or controlled substance use. I request
               that this report be forwarded to WSU Counseling Services.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 09-19-
               2015 at about 1724 hrs I was dispatched to a report of an
               individual at the police department who needed assistance. I
               arrived on scene and contacted Christopher A. Snead (DOB 05-18-
               1993) in the parking lot outside the police department. Snead
               is a WSU student and resides at McEachern Hall #N526. Snead
               said he was concerned someone might have accessed his personal
               banking information and told me someone from the "deep web" had
               accessed his computer. Snead appeared to be unusually paranoid,
               anxious, and confused. Snead told me he needed to contact his
               bank, which he identified as the Navy Federal Credit Union.
               Snead said he believed he was the victim of a scam and
               indicated that someone was tracking him. I used the laptop
               computer from my patrol vehicle and opened the website for the
               Navy Federal Credit Union. I called the bank for Snead and
               spoke to a bank representative. After speaking with the bank
               representative, it did not appear that anything was wrong with
               Snead's account. Snead saw the website on the screen of my
               laptop computer and was convinced that the routing number on
               the bank's website was his personal account number. Snead
               believed that his cellular telephone, which he was holding in
               close proximity to my laptop computer, was being controlled by
               the internet hackers and was affecting the bank's website. I
               questioned Snead about his health. Snead said he had spoken to
               a counselor at WSU Counseling Services one time in the past.
               Snead said he was never prescribed any medication and is not
               taking any medication at this time. Snead told me he has been
               taking "dabs" throughout the summer, which he purchased at the
               local marijuana store. Dabs is a highly concentrated marijuana
               extract. Snead told me the dabs might be affecting his ability
               to think clearly. Snead said he last took some dabs about 48
               hours ago. Snead said he has not been sleeping well lately,
               which he attributed to his dabs usage. I asked Snead if he
               wanted to speak with a counselor, and he said yes. After
               evaluating Snead, I determined that he did not meet the
               criteria to be taken into protective custody. I contacted the
               director of WSU Counseling Services, Cassandra Nichols, on the
               telephone and discussed the situation with her. Nichols

               suggested that I encourage Snead to voluntarily go with me to
               the Pullman Regional Hospital, and he could speak with a
               counselor there. Nichols also suggested that I notify McEachern
               Hall staff of Snead's condition, so they could check on him. I
               talked with Snead about going to the hospital and speaking with
               a counselor. Snead said he would rather visit WSU Health and
               Wellness on Monday. I offered to transport Snead to McEachern
               Hall, but he declined the offer. I concluded my contact with
               Snead, and he walked away. I later contacted the on-call hall
               director and advised him of the situation. The hall director
               said he would provide McEachern Hall staff members with the
               information. I request that this report be forwarded to WSU
               Counseling Services. No further action at this time.

               Charges Forwarded MIP Exhibiting 2. NARRATIVE: On 09/19/15 at
               approximately 1735 hours I was working the WSU football game at
               Martin Stadium. I was standing at the top of the stairs near
               the Student Plaza when I noticed a male and female walking up
               the stairs. The female, later identified as Hannah Katherine
               Fry 08/02/95, was stumbling forwards as she walked up the
               stairs. The male was holding onto Fry as they walked. When Fry
               reached the top of the stairs I noticed that she appeared to be
               under the age of 21. Fry's movements were exaggerated and slow.
               At the top of the stairs Fry appeared to stumble forward again
               and bent over at the waist. Fry's movements were a stark
               contrast to the numerous other people walking into the football
               game. I contacted Fry and told he we needed to talk. I walked
               Fry away from the crowd and asked he how much she had to drink.
               Fry said "not too much." I asked how much that was for her and
               Fry said she had about two shots and two beers. I asked Fry if
               she had her ID and she provided her WSU Cougar Card. Fry
               provided her date of birth verbally and identified herself as
               20 years old. I asked Fry if I could look at her eyes and she
               said I could. I told Fry to stand with heels and toes together
               and follow the tip of my pen with her eyes only. During the
               test I observed equal pupil size, equal tracking, lack of
               smooth pursuit, and distinct and sustained nystagmus in both
               eyes. During the test Fry was swaying side to side. As I stood
               in front of Fry I could clearly smell the odor of intoxicants
               coming from her breath. I asked Fry if she was willing to
               provide a voluntary PBT sample. Fry said she would. I found my
               PBT (Alco-Sensor FST #16805) in working condition. Fry provided
               a PBT sample of .147. I told Fry that she was under arrest for
               MIP Exhibiting and handcuffed (D/L) her. I told Fry that she
               was being audio and video recorded and walked her to the
               processing room. Once at the processing room I read Fry her
               Miranda Rights off my department issued card. Fry stated she
               understood her rights. I told Fry that I would be forwarding
               charges of MIP Exhibiting to the prosecutor and explained the
               process. I read Fry an ejection notice and walked her out of
               the stadium. Fry was released from custody and I returned to
               the game. END OF REPORT I certify and declare under penalty of

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W4311 SYNOPSIS: Subject was arrested,

               09/19/15 at about 1817 hrs I was working at the WSU vs Wyoming
               football game. I was standing near gate I monitoring people
               entering the stadium when I noticed a male, later identified as
               Chad M. Menor (041296), who was walking up the stairs from
               Student Plaza. Menor caught my attention because he appeared to
               be under the age of 21 and was having difficulty walking,
               staggering side to side and bumping into people. I contacted
               Menor near gate I and asked how much he had to drink. Initially
               he denied consuming alcohol but after telling him I didn't
               believe him he told me he had "a little bit". As I spoke with
               Menor I could smell the odor of intoxicants on his breath.
               Menor said he did not have his driver's license and admitted to
               being 19. He provided his cougar card and date of birth, which
               confirmed he was under 21. Menor swayed side to side as he
               stood and spoke with me. I advised Menor he was under arrest
               and that I would be escorting him to the processing room. I
               told him he was being recorded. Once reaching the processing
               room I advised Menor of his constitutional rights from a pre
               printed card. I issued Menor criminal citation #5Z0585680 for
               MIP Exhibiting. I explained the citation to him and he received
               his copy. I read Menor a criminal trespass warning and provided
               him with a copy. Menor was escorted out of the stadium. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 21 day of September, 2015, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer

               approximately 1820 hours, I was traveling on Cougar Way near
               the Global Scholars Hall when I saw a subject carrying a 4 Loko
               can of beer which I could see was open. As I began to pass by,
               I observed her take the can in her right hand and try to hide
               it behind her leg. I got out of my vehicle, activated my body
               camera, and contacted the female and asked her for her
               identification as she had an open container of beer. She stated
               she didn't have any ID and I could see she had a credit card
               and other cards in the back of her cell phone case. As she
               played with the cards, I could clearly see a Cougar Card. I
               asked her to pull it out and she was identified as Hannah M.
               Ruiz. While speaking with Ruiz, I could smell the odor of
               intoxicants emitting from her breath and her speech was
               slurred. I told her friends who were with her to walk away and
               they eventually did. I asked Ruiz how old she was and she said
               19. I had her put down the beer and her cell phone. I then
               advised her she was under arrest for MIP and she had the right
               to an attorney. I handcuffed her, double locked the handcuffs,
               and had her sit down on the cement stairs. Ofc. Jones arrived
               around this time, but left for a call a short time later. I
               issued Ruiz Criminal Citation #C-09926 for RCW 66.44.270.2A for
               MIP. I explained the ticket to her and provided her with her
               copy. I released her from the handcuffs and had her dump out
               the beer which had a very small amount left in the can. I then
               advised her it would be better for her to go home than remain
               in public since she had been drinking. She stated she
               understood. I also issued her a verbal warning for Open
               Container in the City Limits. I cleared. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               hours I was dispatched to a male who fell in front of Murrow
               Hall. I responded to the area. Pullman Fire personnel were
               already on scene when I arrived. They were talking to the male
               patient later identified as Keegan R. Stone (06/30/97). Stone
               was sitting on a concrete retaining wall. His head was down
               between his knees. There was vomit covering the ground. Stone
               had also urinated in his shorts. He had a large raised bleeding
               bump on his forehead. Stone was not oriented to his
               surroundings, he thought he was in front of his fraternity. His
               speech was slurred and the odor of alcohol was coming from him
               and his vomit. He told me he drank too much alcohol. He told me
               he drank one fifth of vodka and several beers between 1600
               hours and now (1825). Stone later said he drank half of the
               fifth of vodka and several beers. He was too intoxicated to
               accurately tell me how much he drank. Stone said he shared his
               alcohol with his date on "Date Dash" with his fraternity.
               Pullman Fire personnel transported Stone to Pullman Regional
               Hospital. He went to the hospital voluntarily. No charges or
               citations issued. I certify and declare under penalty of

               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 19th day of

               NARRATIVE: On 09/19/15 at about 1848 hrs I was working at
               Martin Stadium for the WSU vs Wyoming football game. I was on
               the Student Plaza when I was informed by Staff Pro of a subject
               who was urinating near the entrance to the student plaza. I
               responded to the area and Staff Pro pointed out a male, later
               identified as Jaelyn C. Lewis (092796), who appeared to be
               under the age of 21 and was highly intoxicated. He was having
               great difficulty standing, swaying side to side, and stumbling
               as he tried to walk. I contacted Lewis near the entrance to the
               Student Plaza. I asked how much he had to drink and Lewis said,
               "quite a bit". I asked for his ID and he said he did not have
               it. I told him I could see his wallet in his back pocket. I
               asked how old he was and he said 19. He continued to try deny
               having his wallet. Due to his level of intoxication he was not
               able to remove his wallet. He asked me to remove it for him. I
               removed his wallet from his back pocket. Inside I found an AZ
               driver's license, which confirmed he was under 21.. As I spoke
               to Lewis I could smell a strong odor of intoxicants on Lewis'
               breath. I advised Lewis he was under arrest for MIP Exhibiting
               and placed him in handcuffs (double locked). I told him he was
               being recorded and of his right to remain silent and his right
               to an attorney. I walked Lewis to the processing room, where I
               read him his Constitutional Rights from a pre printed card. I
               completed a criminal citation for Lewis. As I was trying to
               complete the citation Lewis was spitting repeatedly on to the
               floor, even after having a garbage can provided right in front
               of him. I issued Lewis criminal citation #5Z0585681 for MIP
               Exhibiting. I requested a transport unit to come get Lewis and
               transport him to the Pullman PD holding facility. Corporal
               Daniels came to transport Lewis. On her way to the Pullman PD
               holding facility Lewis began to pass out in the back seat of
               her vehicle. She released Lewis from custody and transported
               him to PRH for detox. See related case for further. On 09/20/15
               I contacted Lewis on the phone and explained his citation to
               him a second time. I told him, since he was detoxed by the
               other officer and I was not able to give the citation to him I
               would explain it again and have it mailed to him. I explained
               the citation to Lewis and advised him to expect it in the mail.

               Lewis/09-27-96 Detoxed 2. NARRATIVE: On 09-19-15 at
               approximately 1906 hours, I responded to the WSU PD processing
               room at Martin Stadium to transport a subject in custody to
               Pullman PD. I arrived and Ofc. Boyd advised me Jalen had been
               arrested for MIP. He stated Jalen had spit in his face and on
               the floor several times. He stated he did not feel Jalen had
               intentionally done this, but was too intoxicated to not stop or
               understand what he was doing. Jalen was placed in my handcuffs
               and the handcuffs were double locked. I had activated my body
               camera when I entered processing. I removed keys from Jalen's
               front left pocket and Ofc. Boyd removed a cell phone and a
               wallet from his pocket. I also removed a pair of sunglasses he
               had on his head. All the items were placed in an evidence bag
               to take it with him. Ofc. Boyd and I escorted Jalen to my
               patrol car and the whole time, I observed he was having a hard
               time walking and had repetitive speech. He appeared to be very
               intoxicated by his actions and speech. Once he was placed in my
               patrol vehicle, a spit hood was placed on his head as he
               continued to spit. I began to transport Jalen to Pullman PD.
               While transporting him, I observed he kept passing out in the
               car. Each time I would tell him to wake up, and he would for a
               second or two and then pass out again. He also could not keep
               his head up. Based on my observations, I believed Jalen needed
               to be taken to PRH and evaluated for Detox. I advised Whitcom I
               was going to PRH instead and asked them to notify the hospital.
               I arrived at the hospital and an employee met me at the doors
               with a chair. We put Jalen in the chair and wheeled him into a
               room. He continued to have several mood swings from, bawling,
               to asking if he could talk to me, to being angry, to
               apologizing and crying again. I provided the staff with his
               identification and health insurance card from his wallet. I
               then turned his property over to them and completed a Release
               of Adult Protective Custody form which was signed by the ER
               Doctor. It was later scanned into Files. I then advised Jalen
               he was no longer under arrest, but was not free to leave the
               hospital until he was discharged. He stated he understood. I
               cleared once hospital staff stated I could. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               Cited and released MIP 5Z1022281 2. NARRATIVE: On 09/19/15 at
               about 1915 hours I was working at Martin Stadium for the WSU vs
               Wyoming football game. A program vendor flagged me down and
               pointed an individual who was walking away from him. The
               subject began to walk around a pillar in an attempted to avoid
               me. I contacted the subject, Riley S. Hillis, as the vendor
               also caught up with us. The vendor said Hillis attempted to
               take a program from the box in his hands without paying for it.
               Hillis was staggering when I first saw him and there was
               ketchup on his shirt and hands. I asked him how old he was, he
               said nineteen. I asked him how much he had to drink, he said
               two or three beers. I told Hillis I was going to warn him,
               ejected him from the game and forward my report to student
               conduct. He told me he was not a student at WSU. I escorted
               Hillis to processing. In processing I asked Hillis if he had
               identification on him. He said he did and took out his wallet.
               As he took his Colorado driver's license out of his wallet I
               thought I saw a WSU ID card, and Hillis appeared to be
               attempting to hide something in his wallet. I asked to see his
               WSU ID, he again said he was not a student. I asked to see his
               wallet. He then said he had a fake identification and took it
               out of his wallet. The fake identification was a Pennsylvania
               driver's license. There was not a WSU ID in his wallet.
               Hillis's eyes were bloodshot and watery and there was an odor
               of intoxicants coming from his breath. I issued and explained
               to Hillis a citation (#5Z1022281) for MIP exhibiting. I warned
               him for the fake identification and confiscating it. On
               09/21/15 I photographed and processed the fake identification.
               I placed it into evidence for destruction. Nothing further. I

               09-19-15 at approximately 1858 hours Ofc. Stewart, Deputy
               Kinonen, and I were on patrol in Martin Stadium for the WSU
               Football game. We were radioed that Crowd Management Services
               (CMS) would like officers to meet them out by the student
               concourse near section 30. We responded to the area. Two CMS
               employees had a male with them, who was later identified as
               Eric S. Bjerkestrand (DOB 07-04-95). One of the employees had a
               water bottle containing a liquid in his hand along with
               Bjerkestrand's driver's license. The CMS employee said
               Bjerkestrand was trying to play it off like he only had water
               in the bottle. He said he had a beer "Koozie" on it. He said he
               panicked, so the employee took the Koozie off of it and busted
               him for it. The employee told Bjerkestrand to come with him,
               and he took off running from them. The CMS employee handed me
               Bjerkestrand's driver's license, and told me he is 20 years
               old. Bjerkestrand said the bottle contains tequila and Mountain
               Dew Code Red. I told Bjerkestrand I was audio and video
               recording. Bjerkestrand told me he freaked out when he saw the
               CMS employee and panicked. I asked him how much he had to drink
               today. He told me there was probably two shots in the bottle
               and he had a few shots before coming to the game, so about 6-8
               shots. I escorted Bjerkestrand to the processing room in the
               stadium. I told Bjerkestrand I was going to be forwarding
               charges on him for MIP to the Whitman County Prosecuting
               Attorney's Office. I also told him I would be referring him to
               WSU Student Conduct, and that he was going to be trespassed
               from the Stadium for the remainder of the day. I escorted
               Bjerkestrand from the stadium. He was polite and cooperative
               throughout the entire encounter. Later, I determined I would
               not be forwarding charges on him because CMS had already
               detained Bjerkestrand by taking his driver's license. I will
               give Bjerkestrand a call later to let him know I will not be
               forwarding charges. I will still be sending him to WSU Student
               Conduct. No further action. My Vievu camera was activated, and
               the video was later downloaded into the permanent digital

               hours I was dispatched to the area outside of Martin Stadium
               Gate A for an intoxicated female who was being carried by other
               females. The intoxicated female was reported by WSU Police
               Interns. I responded to the area and found the female sitting
               on a concrete retaining wall outside of the stadium. Her
               roommate and friends were with her. Nguyen was sitting but
               swaying. Nguyen had sunglasses on even though it was dark. Her
               speech was slurred. She appeared to be intoxicated. Nguyen was
               not able to provide an adequate breath sample for my FST. I
               tried several times but could not get her to blow enough air.
               She told me she drank been and tequila. None of her friends
               were with her when she was drinking. They couldn't tell me what
               or how much she consumed. Pullman Fire personnel evaluated
               Nguyen. She did not need additional medical treatment at this

               need medical attention however they advised him to go to the
               Health and Wellness Center on Monday. Snead appeared to feel
               better after hearing he did not need immediate medical
               attention. Snead went back to his room and I cleared. END OF

               Officer responded and pipe was no longer there. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. James Louthan Warned Drug Paraphernalia
               in dorm 2. NARRATIVE: On 09-20-15 at approximately 0124 hours I
               was dispatched to the report of a glass pipe in the Rogers Hall
               third floor kitchen, located at 1355 SE Olympia Ave. Dispatch
               advised nobody was in the area of the kitchen when it was
               found. I arrived on scene. I contacted Nathan S. Gleaton (DOB
               10-22-95), the Resident Advisor who initially saw the pipe. He
               told me at about 0120 hours he went into the kitchen and saw
               the glass pipe laying in a pot on the counter. He said the pipe
               was clean and did not contain any marijuana residue. He said
               nobody was in the kitchen at the time. He said then a male by
               the name of "James" who is visiting the resident in #325 came
               into the kitchen and took the pipe. James told Gleaton the pipe
               belonged to him. Gleaton took a photograph of the pipe and he
               later emailed it to me. I later uploaded the photo into
               Spillman. Gleaton told me he did not smell the odor of
               marijuana coming from room #325. I told Gleaton I would knock
               on the door and tell James he is not allowed to have drug
               paraphernalia in the dorm rooms. As I knocked on room #325 a
               male down the hall later identified as Cadence E. Gorrell (DOB
               12-11-96) told me that is his room and nobody should be in
               there. I asked Gorrell where James was, and he said he left
               awhile ago with his other roommate. Gorrell told me James is a
               guest. I asked him if he knew anything about a glass pipe, and
               he said no. I told him to tell James he is not allowed to have
               drug paraphernalia in the dorm rooms, and he told me he would.
               Gorrell told me he thought James last name was Louthan. I
               cleared the scene. No further action. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               hours I responded to an unconsciousness call at Regents Hall
               4th floor bathroom. Upon arrival I found RA's talking to Kaneya
               Noel Puccinelli 12/28/97 who was sitting on the ground in a
               bathroom stall. The RA's had been talking to Puccinelli through
               the stall door. I asked Puccinelli to open the door and she
               did. I asked Puccinelli a series of questions to determine her
               mental status. Puccinelli answered them all correct except she
               could not remember what month it currently was. Puccinelli also
               was unable to correctly spell her first or last name. Once
               medics arrived they determine she was not intoxicated enough to
               be transported to PRH for an alcohol detox. Medics followed
               Puccinelli to her room and decided she was fine to be alone.
               When medics cleared I did as well. END OF REPORT I certify and
