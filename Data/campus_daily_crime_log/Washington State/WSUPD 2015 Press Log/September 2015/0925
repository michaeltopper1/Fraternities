               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W4467 09/25/15 SYNOPSIS: Electrical fire
               in an outlet at Food Quality Building. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On September 25, 2015 at about
               1138 hours Pullman Fire and WSU Police were dispatched to a
               fire alarm at the Food Quality Building. I responded to the
               building and was contacted by Ferdinand's' staff in the parking
               lot. I was told that an electrical outlet in the cheese
               processing room caught fire. Staff witnessed the outlet smoking
               and then catching fire, flames showing. Nothing was plugged
               into the outlet. Ferdinand's' staff pulled the fire alarm and
               evacuated the building. I could smell the odor of burning
               electrical standing in the parking lot outside the building. I
               briefed Pullman Fire personnel upon their arrival. A burnt
               outlet was located by fire personnel in the cheese processing
               room. The outlet was on the west wall of the room. The outlet
               was black and charred. There was a black soot mark about a foot
               in length going up the wall from the outlet. Pullman Fire used
               a thermal imaging camera to check the wall for heat/fire.
               Nothing was found. The outlet appeared to be a GFCI. There
               should have been a plastic cover on the outlet but it was
               missing. I was told by staff that the cover broke off and had
               not yet been replaced. Other outlets in this room had covers on
               them. The room has tile walls and floors. The floor and walls
               were wet as they are constantly hosing them down for the cheese
               making process. There were no other combustibles or sources of
               ignition near the outlet. All of the equipment in the room is
               stainless steel. It is unknown if someone spray water into the
               outlet, but it would be plausible. The fire shall be classified
               as accidental. Digital photos were taken. WSU Facilities
               Operations electricians were called to the scene. The outlet
               was destroyed and associated wires may need to be replaced. No
               damage to the wall or floor. Damage is estimated at $250.00. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 25th day of September, 2015, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer

               garage. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 09-25-2015 at about 1536 hrs I was dispatched to a report of
               a vehicle collision in the Center for Undergraduate Education
               (CUE) Building parking garage, located at 300 NE Troy Lane. I
               contacted the complainant, Raul J. Rodriguez (DOB 11-07-1993),
               on the telephone. Rodriguez had already left the scene and
               returned home. Rodriguez explained that he had parked his
               vehicle on the 3rd floor of the parking garage. When he
               returned to his vehicle, he discovered that the driver side
               rear quarter panel was scratched near the tail light. Rodriguez
               found a note on his vehicle with a female's name and telephone
               number. The note stated that the female had damaged Rodriquez's
               vehicle. Rodriquez told me he was going to call the other
               driver and was planning on working things out with her.
               Rodriguez requested a police case number but did not feel it
               was necessary to document the incident in a formal police
               report at this time. I provided Rodriquez with his case number.
               I told Rodriquez to contact me if he needed assistance
               contacting the other driver or if he decided he wanted the
               collision documented in a police report. Rodriquez said he
               would do this. No further action at this time. Olmstead/339 I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and

               NARRATIVE: ON 09-25-15 I was dispatched to a weapons offense on

               contacted the R/A of the 7th floor a Danielle Chiriguayo. She
               stated that the resident of room 721 was standing in her
               doorway showing her roommate how a tazer worked. She activated
               it and the R/A could hear the tazer zapping. The R/A had just
               got out of the shower so she quickly put on some cloths and
               went back out into the hallway. By the time she came back out
               the two were gone. We went and knocked on 7231, but no one
               answered the door. trhe R/A stated that she would talk top the
               occupants of the room the next day. UI told her if she want me
               there to call and I would assist he. She said she would if she
               needed any help. She stated she was just worried about
               contacting the residents at that time, but would follow-up
               later. I told her to call if she needed any more help and we
               ended the conversation. I did not identify the two female
               residents. As of this time on 09-27-15 the R/A has yet to
               request any more help. Case closed. I certify and declare under

               unconscious subject in front of Kimbrough Hall, located at 680
               NE Library Rd. Dispatch advised a Cougar Security Unit could
               see a male laying on the ground. I arrived on scene. I could
               see a male laying face down on the ground and two males
               standing by him. The two males said he is their friend and they
               were trying to get him back to his dorm room. The males were
               later identified as Richard R. Luehrs (DOB 02-28-97) and Harley
               J. Coldiron (DOB 09-08-97). The male on the ground was later
               identified as Tyler K. McDaniel (DOB 11-21-96). McDaniel tried
               to tell me he was fine. I told him he did not look fine to me.
               He began to try and stand up, but began to fall back down. I
               told McDaniel he needed to stay seated. He continued to try to
               stand up. McDaniel told me "don't fuck me". I told him I was
               just there to make sure he was okay. I could smell the strong
               odor of intoxicants coming from McDaniel. He was unable to sit
               upright without being supported. He would topple over if he was
               not supported. Cpl. Kuhrt soon arrived on scene as backup
               officer. Cpl. Kuhrt and I helped move him over to a nearby wall
               he could put his back up against for support. When I was asking
               him for his name he was unable to provide me with his correct
               name or spell it correctly. I asked if he would provide a
               voluntary PBT sample. I got a weak sample of .233. Pullman Fire
               and Medics soon arrived on scene. As they were evaluating
               McDaniel he began to projectile vomit multiple times. He was
               then placed into the back of the ambulance. Cpl. Kuhrt and I
               cleared the scene. No further action. My Vievu camera was

               09-26-15 at approximately 0046 hours I was on a traffic stop at
               North Fairway Rd. and Stadium Way. As I was walking back to my
               vehicle I saw a female standing next to my patrol vehicle on
               the sidewalk. She walked up to me and handed me a driver's
               license and WSU Cougar Card Maxx belonging to Michelle L.
               Pappalardo (DOB 12-10-96). The female told me she found the
               items on the sidewalk over near Martin Stadium. I thanked the
               female, but was unable to get her information. After I finished
               my traffic stop I called Pappalardo on the phone. I told her I
               had her driver's license and Cougar Card. She told me I could
               meet her outside of Rogers Hall. I drove to Rogers Hall and
               returned the items to Pappalardo. I told her to check her
               Cougar Card account to see if there was any fraudulent
               activity, and she said she would. I cleared the scene. No
               further action. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 26th day of September, 2015, in

               in Rogers Hall was suicidal. Officers responded and took
               suicidal subject into protective custody. He was transported to
               Pullman Regional Hospital for treatment. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Brandon S. Peters/03-22-97 Protective
               Custody 2. NARRATIVE: On 09-26-15 at approximately 0107 hours I
               was dispatched to the report of suicidal subject. Dispatch
               advised the complainant, Emma V. Kurtenbach (DOB 05-11-95),
               said the subject has been suicidal for the past three nights
               and threatening to overdose. He told the complainant he stopped
               taking his medication and planned on drinking himself to death.
               Ofc. Westerman and I arrived on scene. One of the resident
               advisors told me Peters just went into his dorm room and locked
               the door. He told them he was tired and going to sleep. Another
               Resident Advisor said he spoke with him and she asked him if he
               had a plan to kill himself, and he told her pills. He also
               mentioned something about overdosing on alcohol to them. They
               both told me once he knew they were calling for help he began
               to shut down and stop answering their questions. I went to room
               #819 and knocked on the door. Peters roommate answered the
               door. Peters was laying in his bed sleeping. I asked if I could
               come in, and his roommate said that was okay. I told Peters who
               I was and that I needed to speak with him. He told me he was
               really tired, and I told him I really needed to speak with him.
               Peters got up and followed Ofc. Westerman and I to the empty
               study room on the 8th floor of Rogers Hall. I asked him what's
               going on, and he said he was tired. I asked him if he knew why
               we were there, and he replied because of his depression. I
               asked him how he was feeling, and again he replied just tired.
               I asked him if he was thinking about hurting himself, and he
               said no. I asked if he thought about killing himself, and again
               he said no. I told Peters I was hearing other stories. He then
               told me he felt like that earlier, but he does not feel like
               that now. He told me he had a breakdown and he just does not
               feel good. I asked him what kind of breakdown. I asked him what
               he meant by earlier, and he said a couple of hours ago. I asked
               him what his plan was to carrying it out, and he said "I just
               didn't want to be here". I asked him how he was planning on
               killing himself, and he said he was not going to do anything. I
               told Peters I was concerned about his safety. I told him I
               would be taking him to Pullman Regional Hospital, and he said
               okay. I searched him without further incident. I placed him in
               the back of my patrol vehicle. I transported him to Pullman

               for blood draw. Results pending, charges to be forwarded.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.Evan A. Dunnam 01/05/96
               Arrested/Forwarded DUI 2. NARRATIVE: On 09/26/15 at
               approximately 0105 hours I was traveling west on NE Cougar Way
               from D. St. As I neared the top of the hill, I could see the
               defendant's vehicle cresting the hill traveling eastbound
               towards me. The vehicle appeared to be driving well in excess
               of 30 MPH in a 20MPH speed zone. I could see the front of the
               vehicle rise as it went over the crest of the hill. As the
               vehicle passed me I activated my rear radar and it displayed a
               speed reading of 36MPH. The vehicle was decelerating at this
               time as I could see the brake lights. I turned around and
               caught up with the vehicle as it was turning into the driveway
               to Scott-Coman Hall. As the vehicle was traveling down the
               driveway, it was driving close to the left curb. I activated my
               emergency lights and the vehicle came to a stop in a parking
               stall. I contacted the driver and told him the stop was being
               recorded and asked him if he knew why I stopped him. The driver
               said he did not. As the driver spoke I noticed his words were
               slow and slurred. I told the driver the reason for the stop. I
               asked for his license, registration, and proof of insurance. As
               the driver retrieved his license from his wallet he fumbled to
               remove his license. The driver was identified as Evan A. Dunnam
               01/05/96. Dunnam began to look for his registration and proof
               of insurance. I asked Dunnam where he was coming from and he
               said a friend's apartment. I asked Dunnam where he was going
               and he said he was going home to Scott Hall. Again as Dunnam
               spoke his words were slurred and deliberate. Dunnam removed his
               registration and handed it to me, saying, "Here is my license."
               Dunnam then provided me with his insurance. While standing at
               the car I could smell a strong odor of intoxicants emitting
               from the vehicle. Dunnam was the sole occupant of the car. I
               asked Dunnam how much he had to drink and he said, "Not that
               much." I asked Dunnam how much that was and he said 1 beer. I
               asked Dunnam if I could check his eyes and he said I could. I
               administered an HGN test with Dunnam seated in the vehicle. I
               saw a lack of smooth pursuit, a distinct and sustained
               nystagmus and an immediate on set of nystagmus. I returned to
               my patrol vehicle and turned off my front facing emergency
               lights. As I was returning to Dunnam's vehicle he began
               vomiting out of the window. As I was walking to the car I

               noticed he was parked very close to the vehicle on his
               passenger's side. It appeared that the mirrors had scraped each
               other. My intern (Intern Arnevick) looked at the mirrors and
               told me there were scrapes on both. After Dunnam was finished I
               asked him if he ate some bad fish. Dunnam said some un
               articulable words and then said, "No, I just had too much to
               drink." I asked Dunnam if he would do some field sobriety tests
               and he said that he wouldn't, but he would take a breath test.
               I asked Dunnam if he would take a PBT test and told him that it
               was voluntary and did not replace the evidentiary breath test.
               After I explained what the evidentiary breath test was, Dunnam
               said he would take the PBT. I had Dunnam exit the vehicle and
               come to the sidewalk. As Dunnam walked he was unsteady on his
               feet and staggered left to right. I told Dunnam it appeared he
               hit the car next to him. I asked Dunnam to go look and give me
               his opinion. Dunnam walked over and looked at the mirrors and
               he said he did hit the other car. Dunnam provided a PBT sample
               of .202 (FST # 62324). I told Dunnam he was under arrest for
               DUI. I handcuffed (D/L) Dunnam and advised him of his right to
               counsel. I reminded Dunnam that I was audio and video
               recording. I sat Dunnam on the frame of the back passenger
               seat. Dunnam vomited again while sitting at my patrol car. I
               checked the mirrors on both vehicles and noticed there was
               matching scratches on both mirrors. There was a lot of other
               pre existing damage to the rear of the other vehicle (WA
               AIX2238) that was not caused by Dunnam. Intern Arnevick
               photographed the collision scene and I later saved the photos
               to the case. I placed my business card with the case number on
               the windshield. Ofc. Petlovany facilitated the tow/impound with
               Myer's towing. I transported Dunnam to Pullman PD for the BAC.
               Upon arrival Dunnam vomited in the sally port prior to entering
               the holding facility. I checked the Draeger instrument and
               found it working properly with the mouth tube warm to the
               touch. I checked Dunnam's mouth at 0139 hours, finding no
               foreign substance. I read Dunnam his Constitutional Rights at
               0141 hours. Dunnam said he understood his rights and signed
               both signature blocks. It appeared Dunnam started to fall
               asleep while signing the signature to waive his rights. His
               signature began to go up at an angle and not along the line. I
               read Dunnam his Implied Consent Warnings for Breath at 0150
               hours. Dunnam asked me to read it again, which I did. I asked
               Dunnam if he understood the warnings and he said he did. I
               asked Dunnam if he would submit to a breath test and he said
               no. I clarified with Dunnam that he was refusing the test and
               he said that he did not want to take it. I marked the "no" box.
               I asked Dunnam to sign that the warnings were read to him and
               he asked if a friend could sign it for him. I told him that he
               would have to sign it and he said that he did not want to. I
               asked Dunnam if he wanted me to put "refused to sign" and he
               said he did. Dunnam began to vomit again. I placed Dunnam in a
               holding cell and entered a refusal into the Draeger instrument.
               I returned to WSUPD and applied for and was granted a search
               warrant for a blood draw (see attached). I returned to Pullman
               PD and explained to Dunnam that I had a warrant to draw his
               blood. I transported Dunnam to PRH laboratory for a blood draw.

               I provided hospital technician (Elizabeth Suarez) with the
               blood draw kit. I watched as Suarez removed the two vials from
               the kit. I read the search warrant and watched as Suarez
               swabbed the crook of Dunnam's left arm with iodine. I watched
               as Suarez drew blood into the two vials. Suarez and I initialed
               the vials and I placed them back in the blood draw kit. I
               transported Dunnam back to Pullman PD to fingerprint and
               photograph him. While he was being photographed he vomited
               again. After being processed I provided Dunnam with a copy of
               the following documents: Driver' Hearing Request, Breath Test
               Document, Tow/Impound Form, the Search Warrant, and the Receipt
               for property taken. Dunnam told me that he did not want to
               refuse the breath test. Dunnam said he wanted to refuse the
               "mobile" breath test. I told Dunnam that we were no longer
               mobile and that we were at the stationary device when he
               refused. Dunnam asked if he could still take the test. I
               explained to Dunnam that it was his right to take an additional
               test administered by a qualified person of his choosing. I
               explained to Dunnam that he might want to talk to an attorney
               before proceeding and he asked if he could. I escorted Dunnam
               to the interview room and called John Hart. I explained the
               circumstances to Hart and gave the phone to Dunnam and left the
               room. After Dunnam was finished talking, he told me that he did
               not want to take the test since a refusal was already entered.
               I released Dunnam from custody and provided him with a courtesy
               transport back to Scott Hall and got him into his room. I
               returned to WSUPD with the blood draw kit and logged it into
               evidence. Charges to be forwarded pending lab results. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W4490 SYNOPSIS: Intoxicated male seen
               throwing up called in by Cougar Security. Male was contacted
               and was warned for MIP Exhibiting. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE

               MIP Exhibiting 2. NARRATIVE: On 09/26/15 at approximately 0132
               hours Cougar Security called in an intoxicated male who was
               puking near the entrance to Wilmer Davis Hall. Upon arrival
               Cougar Security pointed to a male who was stumbling away from
               me. The male appeared to be highly intoxicated and was
               stumbling around. I told the male to stop and he did not. I had
               to run up to the male and grab ahold of his shirt before he
               would stop. I asked the male, later identified as Vincent Marco
               Anzalone 09/02/96, where he was heading. Anzalone stated he was
               walking to Streit Perham. I told Anzalone that he was walking
               the wrong way. Anzalone did not appear to understood. I asked
               Anzalone if he had just vomited and he said he did. Anzalone
               had a little vomit on his chin. I asked Anzalone if he had his
               ID and he grabbed his wallet. Anzalone pulled out his WSU
               cougar card but dropped it on the ground. I asked for his WADL
               and he provided it. Anzalone was identified as 19 years old. I
               asked Anzalone how much he had to drink and Anzalone said a
               little bit. I asked Anzalone how much a little bit was and
               Anzalone said about half a fifth of hard alcohol. I asked
               Anzalone a series of questions to determine his mental status.
               Anzalone was able to answer most of my questions correctly.
               Anzalone was too intoxicated to walk home especially since he
               believed Streit Perham was near Stephenson Hall. I provided
               Anzalone a ride home and dropped him off at Streit Hall. I told
               Anzalone that he was going to be referred to student conduct
               and he stated he understood. END OF REPORT I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               26th day of September, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               15 at approximately 0209 hours I was dispatched to the report
               of the odor of marijuana coming from room #941 in Rogers Hall,
               located at 1355 SE Olympia Ave. Dispatch advised the
               complainant, Britteny L. Alspach (DOB 04-04-89), would meet me
               on scene. I arrived on scene. I met Alspach on the ninth floor
               and she walked me to room #941. As I was about to see if I
               could detect the odor of marijuana coming from the room, the
               door was opened by a male later identified as Jase B. Murphy
               (DOB 08-07-97). Once Murphy opened the door I could smell the
               odor of marijuana coming from inside the room. I asked Murphy
               and the other occupants to exit the room. Anthony S. Grande
               (DOB 02-24-97) followed Murphy out of the room, and they told
               me there was one more inside the room. A male later identified
               as Danny N. Villagrana (DOB 09-15-96) was asleep in one of the
               beds. I asked Murphy if I may go in there and wake him up, and
               he said yes. I woke up Villagrana and he followed me out into
               the hallway. I asked them if they knew why I was there, and
               they said yes. I asked if any of them were 21, and they all
               said no. I asked if any of them had a medical marijuana card,
               and they all said no. I told all of them I was audio and video
               recording. I asked who all smoked tonight, and all three of
               them raised their hands. I asked who lives in the room and
               Murphy and Villagrana told me they did. They all told me they
               were WSU Students. I asked them how much marijuana was in the
               room, and they said none. They told me they were smoking
               outside in front of Rogers Hall. I asked if there was any drug
               paraphernalia in the room, and they all said no. I asked if
               they gave me consent to search their room, I would not find
               anything. They again said there was nothing in there. I asked
               if that would be okay with them if I searched their room, and
               both Murphy and Villagrana said yes. I explained to them they
               would all be referred to WSU Student, and they all seemed to
               understand. They were all polite and cooperative. I cleared the
               scene. No further action. My Vievu camera was activated, and

               from room 325 of Rogers Hall. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 09/26/15 at approximately 0258
               hours I was dispatched to a cold theft in room 325 of Rogers
               Hall. I called the RP who was the RA on duty. I spoke to the RA
               who stated there had been a theft in room 325. The RA provided
               me the victim names of Chrisshnay Venay Brown 01/15/97 and
               Cleiton Aguiar Andrade 09/29/91. I called Brown who provided
               the following account. Brown and several people were in room
               325. Brown said she did not know everybody since she had just
               met most of the people that night. Brown put her wallet in the
               desk drawer in the room. Brown does not live in room 325. Brown
               and several others went to the 12th floor to hang out with
               people. Brown left room 325 around 2330 hours. At approximately
               0245 hours Brown returned to the room and found that her wallet
               was no longer in the desk. Brown found the wallet under a
               pillow on the bed. When Brown looked in her wallet she noticed
               that $240 was missing. Brown said it was 2 $100 dollar bills
               and 2 $20 dollar bills. About this time Andrade stated he found
               his wallet was also missing money. Andrade had his wallet in a
               jacket. Andrade stated he was missing 1 $100 dollar bill.
               Andrade said there had been a lot of people in his room that
               night and he did not know most of them. Both Andrade and Brown
               did not know who took their money. I provided both with their
               case number and my contact information. I told the two to
               contact me if they came across any more information about how
               might have taken their money. END OF REPORT I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
