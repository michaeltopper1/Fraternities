    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Edwards/330 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W4536 SYNOPSIS: Report of a vehicle
               parked about three feet from the curb, causing congestion
               issues with traffic at the intersection. Parking infraction
               issued and owner notified. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR#
               1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 09-28-15 at about 0848 hours I was flagged
               down by a Pullman Transit bus driver on Spokane St near Sloan
               Hall. The driver advised that at the intersection of Spokane St
               and Washington St there was a green passenger car that was
               parked about three feet from the curb that was making it
               difficult for the buses to make the turn. He said they were
               having to turn wide to avoid a collision with the car, which
               was then interfering with traffic in the on-coming lane. I
               drove to the intersection and saw the vehicle in question. The
               car was much further from the curb than the lawful 12 inches. I
               ran the plate and attempted to find an owner to come move the
               car. I called the RO but they did not answer and their
               voicemail was not set up. I issued the vehicle a parking
               infraction for blocking traffic. When I placed the infraction
               under the windshield wiper I saw a note on the dashboard
               indicating the car was broke down. There was a phone number to
               call. I called the number and spoke with "Drew" who told me
               that his brother drives the car and that it was broke down. I
               told Drew that it was parked too far from the curb and was
               causing traffic congestion at the intersection. I told him it
               needed to be moved as soon as possible. He stated he
               understood. I did not fully identify "Drew". I drove past the
               car several more times throughout the day. It had not been
               moved as of about 1300 hours. There were no other calls about
               the car. Parking infraction issued. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 28th day of
               September, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               Warned/Student Conduct Harassment 2. NARRATIVE: On 09-28-15 at
               about 1411 hours I was dispatched to the report of harassment.
               The RP, Danielle E. Liebl, was in the WSUPD lobby for contact.
               I contacted Liebl and her roommate, Sophie M. Stoltman, in the
               lobby. We went into the interview room to speak. I asked them
               to explain what was going on. Liebl and Stoltman told me the
               following; they stated that on 09-17-15 they noticed that
               somebody had written "Lucifer" and an upside down cross on
               their chalkboard. They said they thought it was weird and
               erased the board. They said a couple nights later there was a
               bear image drawn with "haha" written next to it. They said they
               also erased this. They explained that it was a couple nights
               later that they discovered their chalkboard had been completely
               erased by somebody and then saw a male they know as "Justin"
               drawing a red circle with stars inside it on their chalkboard.
               Stoltman said she had left the room to use the restroom and
               when she returned she found Justin at her door, drawing on the
               chalkboard. She said she screamed and knocked on her RA's door
               nearby. The RA made contact with everybody in the hallway and
               told Justin that he cannot draw on other people's door. He
               asked why he couldn't do that. The RA explained to him that it
               is not public property. Apparently he was somewhat confused by
               this. Stoltman said she told Justin to stop and he "just kind
               of laughed". Justin eventually left and Stoltman went back into
               her room. Liebl and Stoltman then told me that between 0230 and
               0300 hours on the night of 09-27-15 they arrived home and did
               not see any drawing on their door. When they woke up the next
               morning they noticed there were several new drawings on the
               door, to include a Chinese flag, the date of October 1st, the
               works "China Stronk!" and a red ball with stars in it that said
               "Chinaball of bestest! Long live Chariman moo!" There were also
               Chinese symbols. The red ball with stars is the same one that
               Stoltman had seen Justin drawing previously on their door.
               Liebl and Stoltman explained that they feel like they are being
               targeted because nobody else is having their doors drawn on.
               They said they are worried because they do not know what the
               reference to October 1st was about. They also explained that
               they only know Justin in passing and do not know why he would
               be doing this. They explained that they just want Justin talked

               to and told to stop. I then went to Community Duncan Dunn and
               had Liebl and Stoltman show me where Justin lived. They
               identified room 235 as his. I saw the name Justin on the door
               and several drawings, some consistent with what was drawn on
               Liebl and Stoltman's door. I knocked several times without an
               answer. I returned to WSUPD and called Justin Lam Po Tang. He
               told me he was in class but would return my phone call. About
               15 minutes later, Justin called. I asked him if he had any idea
               why I was calling and he said no. I asked him if he has been
               writing on other people's chalkboards and he said "just one". I
               asked who's it was and he said "some girls". I asked if he knew
               them and he said no. I asked him why he would be writing on
               their chalkboard and he said because "they write on his" and
               they said that they hate him. I asked Justin if he has seen the
               girls writing on his chalkboard and he said no, but he "knows
               its them". I told Justin to stop writing on their chalkboard.
               He then said he did it because it was a "joke with the guys"
               and that "all the guys to it to each other". I told him that
               they are not the "guys" and they've already asked him twice to
               stop. I explained to Justin that if he is found writing on
               their chalkboard anymore I will arrest him for harassment. He
               stated he understood. I emailed Stoltman and Liebl with
               information about my discussion with Justin. Send to student
               conduct. Warned for harassment. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               29th day of September, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 09-28-15 at
               approximately 1851 hours, I observed a vehicle parked in the
               lane of travel on East Main near Sellas with it's hazard lights
               flashing. I contacted the occupant of the vehicle as another
               vehicle pulled in front of the disabled vehicle. The driver of
               the disabled vehicle stated his transmission wasn't working. He
               showed me the car would not move when put in gear. The other
               driver stated he had a tow rope and would be happy to tow the
               vehicle to the Cenex parking lot. The disabled vehicle driver
               said he would appreciate that and I helped provide traffic
               control for them while they connected the tow rope. As they
               were pulling away, Pullman PD arrived and the call was
               transferred to them. I cleared. I did not identify either

               offense. Subject was contacted. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 09-28-15 at approximately 1855
               hours, I heard Whitcom advise of a possible traffic offense
               coming into Pullman from Moscow. The RP had stated the vehicle
               had almost caused an accident and was traveling at high rates
               of speed. They provided a plate. I was traveling out Grimes Way
               and near the LARC I observed the vehicle traveling towards me.
               The vehicle appeared to be traveling at the posted speed limit
               of 20 mph. I turned around on the vehicle and it pulled over to
               the curb and stopped. I had not activated any emergency lights.
               I pulled in behind the vehicle and turned on my rear flashers
               for safety. I contacted the driver who was later identified as
               Teddi Phares by her WA Driver's License. I advised her I was
               recording and asked her where she was coming from. She stated
               Moscow. I advised her why I was contacting her. I asked her if
               anything had happened in Moscow and she stated as she was
               getting into a lane to turn towards Pullman from the mall, a
               vehicle had pulled right in front of her and she had to swerve
               to the left to miss it. She stated another vehicle had honked
               it's horn, but she did not believe she had not caused any
               problems. She stated as she drove back to Pullman, she had been
               obeying the posted speed limit signs. At this time, WSP Trooper
               1226 arrived and I relayed to him what I had been told. He
               stated he had been on SR 270 monitoring traffic and had not
               seen anyone speeding in excess of the limit as the RP stated.
               He contacted Teddi who relayed the same information to him. As
               neither of us had observed any violations, I told Teddi I
               appreciated her cooperation and advised her to have a nice
               night. We both cleared. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 28th day of

               check on 5th floor Stephenson South because the RP was on the
               phone with her girlfriend and she stopped talking. He heard
               what sounded like her dropping her phone and he hadn't been
               able to get in touch with her. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 092815 at approximately 2328
               hours, I was dispatched to a report of a welfare check on the
               5th floor of Stephenson South. Dispatch advised that Anthony M.
               Lavender was talking to his girlfriend, Gisselle R. Fernandez
               (042097), and she just stopped talking to him. He told dispatch
               he was concerned for her wellbeing. I responded to the 5th
               floor of Stephenson South and walked the hall until I located a
               door decoration with Gisselle's name on the door. I knocked on
               the door and she answered the door. I asked her what was going
               on and she told me she was sitting in the 6th floor lounge
               talking to her boyfriend, and the next thing she knew she woke
               up on the ground. She told me she had a headache and she hasn't
               been eating for the past couple of days. I asked Whitcom to
               dispatch Pullman Fire Department for a medical evaluation.
               While waiting for the medics to respond, Cpl. Daniels began
               talking to Gisselle about school and life. She stated she was
               stressed about school, and she hasn't been eating or drinking
               much. As we continued talking to her, she made a reference to
               some physical abuse she has endured over the course of her
               lifetime from both her parents, Marvin A. Fernandez (03/16/70)
               and Reyna A. Fernandez (11/21/72). She stated that on one
               occasion, her father was upset about her talking back to him
               and he smacked her in the side of the face where she hit her
               head on the wall. She told us her parents have a history of
               alcohol abuse as well. Cpl. Daniels asked her if she was having
               any thoughts of hurting herself and she told us she wasn't.
               About this time, Pullman Fire personnel arrived and began
               checking her for her immediate medical problems. At the
               conclusion of their evaluation, Gisselle agreed to go with them
               to Pullman Regional Hospital for an evaluation. I followed the
               ambulance to the hospital so I could follow up with Gisselle
               more about the abuse going on in their residence. I asked
               Gisselle if I could talk to her further about the incidents of
               abuse and she told me I could. I asked her if it was okay for
               me to record our conversation and she told me that was okay as
               well. I asked her about the incident she was talking about
               where her father hit her in the face. She stated she was a
               senior in high school (approx. October 2014) and she had gone

               camping with some friends. She told me when she returned, her
               father became upset with her and they began fighting. She told
               me she talked back to him and he hit her so hard in the face
               that her head hit the wall. She told me her head and neck hurt
               for a couple of days following that incident. She told me of
               several other incidents where her mother and father would use a
               belt on their legs, back and buttocks. She told me the belt
               would typically leave marks but wouldn't be visible under their
               clothes. I asked her how long the marks would stay on her skin.
               She stated they would last a couple of days. Gisselle told me
               she has an older sister who is 23 who endured physical abuse
               until she moved away for college. She stated her sister would
               return home and the fighting would continue between her parents
               and her sister. Gisselle told me she is concerned for her
               brothers' safety too. She stated she has a brother who is age 4
               and one who is 14 years old. She told me when her sister moved
               to BYU University is when the physical abuse turned to her. I
               asked her how often the abuse happened and she told me it was
               mostly disciplinary when she would talk back to them or do
               something they didn't like. She told me when he hit her in the
               face, she left the house for 5 days before returning. She told
               me the abuse has mostly been verbal following that encounter. I
               asked if she is aware of any abuse toward her brothers, and she
               told me about one time when her mother and father were arguing
               and her 14 year old brother tried to stop them from fighting
               and was struck by a chair. She told me she thought it was
               unintentional, but he was injured from the incident. She
               described the incident as when her 14 year old brother was in
               middle school. Gisselle told me she is having a hard time
               concentrating in school and often thinks about the abuse she
               has endured. I provided her with the Alternatives to Violence
               pamphlet and with my contact information. I strongly suggested
               she contact WSU Counseling Services for help getting through
               the emotional stress of the abuse she has endured. She told me
               she would contact counseling services on 092915. I asked her
               where her father and mother were currently living. She told me
               they are living in Sparks, Nevada with Marvin's cousin Paul
               Fernandez. She provided a phone number for Paul of 510-697-9130
               and her mother's phone number of 775-203-2905. Gisselle told me
               her father works for McQueen High School as a custodian. I
               asked her if the assaults occurred at Paul's house. She told me
               the assaults happened in their residence in Reno Nevada, and
               she isn't aware of any abuse against her brothers since she
               left. I asked her if the abuse was ever sexual in nature and
               she told me it wasn't. I returned to the WSU Police Department
               and downloaded my VieVu videos of the incident. Forward to
               Sparks Nevada Police Department and Sparks Nevada Child
               Protective Services to make sure the children in the home are
               safe. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W4554 SYNOPSIS: Request for a welfare
               check. Unable to locate. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR#
               1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 09-29-15 at about 0223 hours I was
               dispatched to the report of a welfare check at Terrell Library.
               The RP, Ruth Elliot, was requesting assistance in finding her
               daughter, Jane. Ruth explained that Jane went to Terrell
               library earlier in the evening and has not returned home yet.
               She said she is not answering her phone and her voicemail box
               is full. Ruth described Jane as a 58 year old wearing a pink
               sweatshirt and jeans. I went to the library while Officer
               Stewart checked for her vehicle. He did not locate it. I
               searched the library with Intern Bass. We were unable to locate
               Jane. I asked library staff to use the PA to request Jane come
               to the front. I waited but nobody ever showed up. Shortly after
               clearing the call, Whitcom advised that Ruth had called back
               stating that Jane had just arrived home safely. I did not
               obtain full info for Jane. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               29th day of September, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.
