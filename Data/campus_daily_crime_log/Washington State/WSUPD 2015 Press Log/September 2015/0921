    Narrative: RVWD: 316 / OFC: JAK/333 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W4363 SYNOPSIS: A female citizen called
               Whitcom stating she was concerned for the female driver of a
               crimson Toyota because she looked distraught as she drove by
               the bus stop at Grand Avenue and Stadium Way. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 09-21-15, at
               approximately 1000 hours, Rebekah Joy King (12-29-82) called
               Whitcom stating she was concerned about an Asian female who was
               driving a crimson Toyota. King said she was waiting at the bus
               stop on Grand Avenue near Stadium Way when an Asian female
               drove by. She said the Asian female looked at her with a
               distraught look on her face. Also in the Toyota was a male
               passenger in the front passenger seat, who was said to have
               been mixed race and bad acne on his face and another male, who
               was said to have been "hunched down" in the rear seat. King did
               not get the vehicle's license plate, saw no weapons, and was
               not sure if the female needed help. She merely got a bad
               feeling in her gut. There was a 3 to 5 minute time delay
               between when King saw the Toyota drive by her location and when
               the call was dispatched to me. I drove around the WSU campus
               area and was unable to locate a vehicle matching the
               description. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,

    Narrative: RVWD: 316 / OFC: JAK/333 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W4366 SYNOPSIS: A WSU student reported
               having an uneasy feeling about 2 men asking him "Where do all
               the students hang out"? The males were determined to belong to
               a group of males who were trying to educate people about the
               Hare Krishna Religion. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               2. NARRATIVE: On 09-21-15, at approximately 1110 hours, Brendan
               Joseph Smith came to the WSU Police Department and asked to
               speak with an Officer. I met with Smith and asked what I could
               do for him. He said he was walking on Wilson Road from Hulbert
               Hall going to the French Administration Building. He said as he
               walked by a white extended full size van which had no markings
               on its sides. He said two males were in the front of the van
               when one of them asked him "Where do all the students hang
               out"? Smith told them he could find a lot of students near the
               CUB. The male asked him where the CUB was located and Smith
               pointed and said "At the top of the hill". The males thanked
               him and Smith continued walking. Smith said as he entered the
               French Administration Building he began to get an uneasy
               feeling about what the intention of the males was. He decided
               to report the encounter to the Police. Smith said he did not
               get the van's license plate, but described it as being parked
               on Wilson Road, in a metered parking space, near the French
               Administration Building. I told him I didn't mean to cut our
               conversation short, but I wanted to go see if the van was still
               parked in the same location. I drove to the described area and
               saw the white Dodge 3500 extended van. The van had a Missouri
               license plate (MO/AG5H1F). Whitcom said they could not find a
               record of the vehicle. I sat in my patrol vehicle near the van
               and watched it, hoping someone would enter or exit the vehicle
               so I could speak with them. I was dispatched to another call so
               I left the area. At approximately 1237 hours, I was pulling up
               to the WSU Police Department when I saw a male contacting
               several people and handing them what appeared to be books and
               handouts of some sort. I walked up to the male and asked him
               what he was doing. He said he was spreading the word about the
               Hare Krishna Religion. I asked him if he drove a white Dodge
               extended van to Pullman and he said he did. I asked him if we
               could walk to his van so I could look at his vehicle
               registration. He said that would be fine. Once we were at the
               van, he found and handed me a vehicle registration from
               Missouri that expired in 2014. I again asked Whitcom to run the
               license plate through Missouri both as AG5H1F and as AG5HIF.
               They still received no record of the van. I asked them to run

               the van by VIN (WD0PF145585283624) and they still found no
               record of the van. The van was legally parked so I only warned
               the male; later identified as Derek Dante Wynn (05-26-70), if I
               could see his ID. He handed me a Driver's License issued
               through Florida. He came back as clear and current. I advised
               Wynn he was not allowed to solicit people on the WSU Campus
               without express, written permission from the University. He
               said he understood. I cleared with no further action. I certify

               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.

               15 at about 1153 hours I was dispatched to the report of a
               theft. The RP, Zaire C. Andre, was in the WSUPD lobby for
               contact. I contacted Andre in the lobby and asked him to
               explain what was going on. He told me that on Sunday, 09-19-15,
               at around 5:30 PM he was in the CUB studying. He said he got up
               to get food, but left his belongings where he was sitting. He
               said when he returned his backpack, which contained an Apple
               iPad Air and 2 spiral notebooks, was gone. Andre said that
               there were several other people in the CUB at the time, but did
               not notice anybody that was sitting very close to him. He said
               he has no idea who may have taken his backpack. Andre described
               the backpack as a Cougar Athletics, NIKE backpack. He said that
               he had an Apple iPad Air with a black case and cracked screen
               inside the backpack along with 2 spiral notebooks and various
               pens and pencils. He valued the bag at $80.00 and the iPad at
               $300.00. Andre does not know or have access to the serial
               number on the iPad. He was requesting a case number so that he
               could get the iPad replaced. I asked Andre if he has used the
               "find my iPhone" APP to try and locate the iPad. He said that
               it is offline. I provided Andre with my business card and case
               number. I asked him to email me if he found his items or the
               serial number for the iPad. No suspects or leads. I certify and

               barking upon entry to the apartment. Browne exited her room and
               began pacing around the apartment. I explained to Browne that
               repeated text messages or phone calls can be considered
               telephone harassment. Browne told me she didn't know Branch
               didn't want her to be texting her until she was contacted by
               Ofc. Daniels over the weekend. I explained to Browne that I was
               there to make sure things stayed civil between them. Browne
               told me she wanted to know how long Branch intended to have her
               mother in the apartment. Browne stated her dog doesn't like
               people it doesn't know. Browne stated she believes she deserves
               common courtesy to know when Branch will be coming and going
               from the apartment and how long she will be having guests. I
               explained to Browne that Branch didn't have to tell her when
               she was leaving for the weekend, when she was coming or going.
               I explained that Branch is an adult and can come and go as she
               pleases. Browne told me she would like to know because her dog
               barks when she comes and goes in the middle of the night. I
               explained that it's not Branch's problem that her coming and
               going causes her dog to bark. I asked Browne if she had
               anything else to say. She told me she was going to get her dog
               to stop barking and go to bed. I exited the apartment and spoke
               with Branch's parents. I suggested that we try to find Branch a
               place to stay for the night. I contacted the on duty Hall
               Director for the south side of WSU Campus. He was able to
               secure a room in McEachern Hall North for Branch until she
               could get the roommate conflict sorted out. Ofc. Whitman
               escorted Branch to McEachern Hall North and I cleared. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 22nd day of September, 2015, in
