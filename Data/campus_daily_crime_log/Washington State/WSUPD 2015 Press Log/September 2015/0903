               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3918 SYNOPSIS: Report of a harassing
               phone calls being received. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 09/03/15 around 1639 hrs I was
               dispatched to report of a threatening phone call being received
               by John Streamas (12/21/53). I attempted to contact Streamas
               and left him a message to contact me. Around 1700 hrs Streamas
               contacted me and told me the following. Streamas explained
               since information has appeared on Fox and Friends regarding a
               course syllabus which was being used he and his wife have been
               receiving threats both by email and by phone. He went on to
               tell me he has not reviewed his voicemail in a few days and
               upon listening found one call he was a little disturbed by. He
               went on to tell me he didn't view the call as threatening in
               nature and nothing said was directly a threat. Streamas did add
               the male did make comments that he knew where Streamas lived
               and would be see him in one of the classes he taught on
               09/03/15. When asked about whether or not the individual showed
               up in his classroom he told me he did not recognize anyone out
               of the ordinary. I continued and asked if he could identify the
               male and was told he did not know who it was before. When asked
               about the caller ID information I was told he was not that
               great with technology and after explaining what I needed him to
               do asked him to forward the phone call to me. He told me he
               would at which point we discussed personal security and if he
               found anyone strange around his residence to contact the
               police. He told me would and before concluding our call I asked
               him again to forward the voicemail message to me and was told
               he would on 09/04/15. Following my conversation with Streamas I
               completed the necessary paperwork and linked this case with the
               case being investigated by Cpl Edwards. I will await the
               voicemail from Streamas before proceeding further.
               Investigation Continues. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 3rd day of September,
               2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               (07/07/97) Warned Possession of Marijuana NARRATIVE: On
               09/03/15 around 2140 hrs I responded to a report of the odor of
               marijuana coming from room 620 of Gannon Hall. As I was
               responding Whitcom told me the Residential Education Director
               who had responded had not smelled any odor and upon my arrival
               I contacted the complainant, identified as Jenafer L Doolittle
               (07/09/88), and was told the following. Doolittle explained she
               had been contacted by a Resident Advisor who had been looking
               out his window from Goldsworthy Hall and had seen the occupants
               light up what appeared to be a bong of what was believed to be
               marijuana. She went on to tell me upon her arrival she had not
               contacted the occupants of the room and had contacted the
               police. At this point I told her we could go contact the
               occupants and we walked down to room 620. As we approached the
               door I could hear several voices from inside and smelled around
               the crack of the door and noticed what I believed to be the
               odor of burnt marijuana coming from inside of the room. I
               knocked on the door and a short time later the door was opened
               by an individual, later identified as Tyler K McDaniel
               (11/21/96). I asked the 5 occupants of the room if they knew
               why I was there and was told by another male, later identified
               as Richard R Luehrs (02/28/97), they had no idea. Upon hearing
               this I asked what the odor coming from the room was along with
               who lived in the room. McDaniel told me he lived in the room
               and I asked him to come out into the hallway and speak with me,
               which he did. Once outside in the hallway I explained I was
               there due to the odor of marijuana coming from within the room
               at which point he lowered his head, which based upon my
               training and experience is an indicator of guilt. When asked if
               they had been smoking in the room McDaniel confirmed they had
               been. I asked him if everyone currently in the room had been
               smoking and was told they had. I provided McDaniel with his
               Ferrier Warnings and asked if I could come inside and speak
               with him and the rest of the occupants of the room. He told me
               that would be fine and we walked into the room where I began to
               speak with the remainder of the occupants, later identified as

               J Coldiron (09/08/97), and Luehrs. I asked the group if there
               was any marijuana remaining in the room and was told there was
               not. We spoke for a period of time regarding the laws regarding
               possession of marijuana and that I would be forwarding this
               case to student conduct. At this point Gordon, and McDaniel
               told me they have previously had to deal with Student conduct
               and we discussed this being the second contact in less than two
               weeks of classes. The other occupants told me they had not
               previously had contact with Student conduct and we briefly
               spoke about this process. I explained I would be writing a
               report regarding this incident and their cooperation with me
               and it would most likely be looked at by them. Prior to
               concluding my conversation with them I told them hall staff
               might also wish to speak with them following our conversation
               and was told that would be fine. Shortly after this I concluded
               our conversation and briefly spoke with hallstaff before
               clearing. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 3rd day of September,

               and released for MIP Exhibiting. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Jake W. Klees 02/05/96 Cited/Released MIP
               Exhibiting 5Z0970082 2. NARRATIVE: On 09/04/15 at approximately
               0011 hours I was driving eastbound on Cougar Way approaching
               Northside Hall when I noticed a male, later identified as Jake
               Wyatt Klees 02/05/96, stumbling side to side as he walked
               eastbound on Cougar Way. Klees was stumbling side to side to
               the severity of an approximate 4 foot stagger. Klees was
               stumbling so much that several times he crossed his foot in
               front of the other foot. I passed Klees and pulled into an
               access road a few feet in front of him. When I passed Klees I
               noticed Klees appeared to be under the age of 21. I exited my
               car and walked up to Klees. As I reached Klees I asked him if
               he had a second to talk. Klees stopped and I asked him if he
               had his ID with him. Klees handed me his WADL which identified
               him as 19 years old. I asked Klees how much he had to drink and
               Klees said not that much. I asked how much that was for him and
               Klees said one or two beers. I asked Klees if I could look at
               his eyes and he said I could. I performed and HGN test on
               Klees. I told Klees to stand with his heels and toes together
               and keep his arms at his sides. Klees was told to follow the
               tip of my pen with his eyes only while keeping his head still.
               As soon as I moved my pen Klees moved his head to follow the
               pen. I reminded Klees to keep his head still. During the test I
               observed, equal pupil size, equal tracking, lack of smooth
               pursuit, distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation,
               and onset of nystagmus prior to 45 degrees. Klees eyes were
               watery and bloodshot. As Klees stood before me I could clearly
               smell the overpowering odor of intoxicants coming from his
               breath. I asked Klees if he was willing to provide a PBT sample
               and Klees said he would. I found my PBT (Alco-Sensor FST
               #16805) in working condition. Klees provided a PBT sample of
               .204. I told Klees that he was under arrest for MIP and
               handcuffed (D/L) him. I advised Klees that he was being audio
               and video recorded. I read Klees his Miranda Rights off my
               department issued card and Klees stated he understood his
               rights. I searched Klees incident to arrest and found no
               weapons of illegal items. I placed Klees in the backseat of my
               patrol car while I reached his local contacts. I found that
               Klees had been contacted on 01/17/15 by Ofc. Whitman for MIP
               Exhibiting. Klees provided a PBT sample of .180 and was
               referred to Student Conduct only. On 02/11/15 Klees was

               arrested for possession of marijuana by Ofc. Boyd. Due to Klees
               prior contacts I filled out a Sector citation for MIP
               Exhibiting. It was my opinion that Klees was intoxicated to the
               point that I did not feel that he could safely walk home so I
               transported Klees to his residence 500 NE Colorado Street. Once
               at 500 NE Colorado, I issued Klees Sector citation 5Z0970082. I
               explained the citation and provided him with his copy. Klees
               was released from custody and I cleared. END OF REPORT I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of

               left her driver's license at home in Tacoma, Washington.
               However, she was able to provide me with her information. She
               handed me her vehicle registration which expired in August,
