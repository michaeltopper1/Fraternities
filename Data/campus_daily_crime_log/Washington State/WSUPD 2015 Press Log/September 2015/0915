               Report of a non-injury accident on Stadium Way near Grimes.
               DRIVER 1: Kahlee L. Hobson-Sims (05-29-97) VEHICLE 1:

               Steven K. Reisenauer (03-22-59) NARRATIVE: On 09-15-15 at
               approximately 1302 hours, I responded to a non-injury accident
               on Stadium Way at Grimes. I contacted the parties involved and
               asked if there were any injuries and they all said no. I
               advised them I was recording and asked the driver of the Honda,
               Kahlee, what happened. She stated she was pulling up behind the
               van which was stopped and she thought she had hit her brake
               when she had really hit her gas pedal. She then rear ended the
               van. I asked her if she had her seatbelt on at the time and she
               said yes. I asked her if she had been using her cell phone and
               she said no. I took a couple of photographs of the vehicles in
               the roadway, and then had them move the vehicles to the
               entrance of the Fine Arts Building. I took more photographs and
               collected driver's licenses, registrations, and insurance
               information. Steven Reisenauer was a passenger in the van with
               Brian Mitzel. Both Brian and Steven had been wearing their
               seatbelts. I helped both parties exchange information and
               explained the process to both drivers. I also advised both
               groups to call if they had any further questions or if any
               injuries were later discovered and they stated they would. I
               spoke with Kahlee about inattentive driving and discussed
               making sure she was providing proper distance between vehicles.
               She stated she understood. Neither had any further questions
               and I cleared. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 15th_ day of September, 2015 in

               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Mikala E. Papahronis/091596 Student Conduct MIP
               Exhibiting 2. NARRATIVE: On 09/16/15 at about 0055 hrs I was
               driving westbound on Cougar Way passing Global Scholars Hall
               when I noticed a female, later identified as Mikala E.
               Papahronis (091596), who was sitting on the stairs for Einstein
               Bros Bagels. Papahronis caught my attention because she was
               slumped over and there was a large pool of vomit next to her.
               There were several people standing around her who appeared to
               be trying to help her. I stopped and as I walked up to the
               group someone said they were ok and that Papahronis was just
               sick. I asked how much she had to drink and did not receive a
               response other than she was a light weight. I had Papahronis
               stand up and tried to talk to her. She told me she had several
               shots of alcohol. I could smell a strong odor of intoxicants on
               her breath. Papahronis was having difficulty standing on her
               own and asked to sit down. I had her sit down on the stairs
               again. One of Papahronis' friends were able to provide me with
               her driver's license, which indicated she was under 21.
               Papahronis was able to answer my questions correctly so I told
               her I would let her go home with her friends and would be
               sending the incident to student conduct only. One of her
               friends, Katie R. Bufi (112896), said she would stay with
               Papahronis to make sure she was ok. Nothing further. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.
               Dated this 16 day of September, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               NARRATIVE: On 09/16/15 around 0102 hrs I was dispatched to a
               report of the odor of marijuana coming from room 617 of
               Goldsworthy Hall. Ofc Boyd and I responded and upon our arrival
               spoke with hall staff, who was not identified, who told us the
               following. While walking down the hallway they noticed the odor
               of marijuana in the air around the area of room 617. Neither of
               the hall staff members were able to determine the location of
               the odor and Whitcom was called. Boyd and I tried to locate the
               source of the odor, and unable to locate any odor before
               speaking with hall staff again. We learned the occupants from
               room 617 had no prior contacts and generally kept to
               themselves. Boyd and I instructed them to keep an eye on the
               room and if it became an issue again to contact us. We were
               told they would and we cleared a short time later. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 16th day of September, 2015, in
