               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W4517 SYNOPSIS: Concerned parent called
               regarding the living situation in her daughter's dorm. The on-
               call Hall Director was contacted and plans were made for the
               resident to switch dorm rooms. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 09-27-15 at about 1145 hours I
               was asked to take the "others" call off the screen. I read the
               CAD comments and saw that a concerned parent was calling
               regarding their daughter living in unhealthy conditions. I
               called the mother, Nina Brescia, who resides in Nevada. I asked
               Nina to explain what was going on. Nina told me that her
               daughter, Erica, lives in Stephenson South, room 721. She said
               that Erica's roommate is very dirty and leaves dirty clothes,
               dirty dishes and old food about the room. She said that the
               conditions have become so bad that Erica has contracted head
               lice two times and now the room was infested with bed bugs.
               Nina explained that she has tried calling residence life, but
               nobody answers the phone or returns her phone calls. She also
               said that the RA has been notified of the situation and is
               "doing nothing". She said that at the moment, her daughter was
               sitting on her bed "in hysterics" because she does not know
               what to do. Nina explained that they felt helpless about the
               situation so they were calling the police for help. She told me
               that she wanted her daughter moved out of the room. I told Nina
               that I would get in touch the Hall Director for Stephenson
               South, and together with the HD I would contact Erica. I
               explained to Nina that I do not have the authority to switch
               rooms for people and the hall director would be able to help
               resolve the situation. I ended my phone call with Nina and
               attempted contact with Dustin Cooper, the South HD. He did not
               answer, I left him a voicemail. I then called the on-call duty
               phone and spoke with Brittany Alspach about the situation. She
               agreed to meet me in front of the Stephenson Complex. I then
               called Erica. I told her that I had talked with her mother and
               asked her to meet me and the HD in front of the Stephenson
               Complex. She agreed. Once I arrived at the Stephenson Complex I
               contacted Erica. I asked her to explain what was going on. She
               immediately became emotional and said she cannot live in these
               "fucking disgusting" conditions and wanted to move out. I asked
               her to explain the conditions she was living in. She went on to
               say that her roommate, who she was randomly paired with, is
               filthy. She said she leaves dirty clothes all over the place,
               trash about the room, rotting food and dirty dishes around, and
               is "gross". She said that her roommate works in the animal

               barns on campus and when she gets home she just takes her dirty
               clothes and shoes off and leaves them on the ground, then
               climbs into bed without showering. Erica explained that in the
               last month she has had head lice two times and said now there
               are bed bugs in their room. Erica said that she has tried to
               ask her roommate to clean up and she refuses. I asked Erica if
               she thought the bugs might be fleas or ticks from the animal
               barns and she said she wasn't sure, but it was "nasty".
               Brittany then explained briefly what the procedure would be to
               move out of the room. We all three then went upstairs to room
               721. Erica unlocked the door and invited us in. I looked in
               from the doorway. I could see that one side of the room, which
               Erica identified as hers, was very clean, picked up and the bed
               was made. The other side of the room was very unkept, with
               heaps of clothes, garbage and food everywhere. It did not
               appear to have been picked up in a very long time. I did not
               see any obvious signs of a bed bug infestation. The room was
               secured and we all went to the Hall Director's office where I
               stood by while Brittany worked with Erica to change her room
               assignment. Brittany had also been in contact with the
               troubleshooters as well as the head custodian for the South
               Tower. She explained the process for clearing the bed bugs out
               and said it would be a couple days before Erica could move, to
               reduce the risk of spreading the bugs to other areas. Erica
               stated she understood and seemed pleased with the outcome. She
               had her mother on the phone who also seemed happy about the
               plans that were made. Forward case to Residence Life. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 27th day of September, 2015, in

               to a report of malicious mischief. The complainant reported
               that her motorcycle had been damaged. No suspects or leads.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 09-27-
               2015 at about 1246 hrs I was dispatched to a report of
               malicious mischief at Orton Hall, located at 1475 SE Olympia
               Avenue. I arrived on scene and contacted the complainant, Mia
               E. Alvarez (DOB 05-01-1995). Alvarez reported that on 09-25-
               2015 at about 0800 hrs she checked her green, 2012 Kawasaki
               Ninja motorcycle (WA Lic. 7D4536) which was parked in the
               parking lot directly in front of the main entrance doors to
               Orton Hall. Alvarez said her motorcycle was not damaged at this
               time. On 09-27-2015 at about 1230 hrs Alvarez returned to her
               motorcycle and discovered that it was positioned differently in
               the parking space and had been damaged. Alvarez showed me her
               motorcycle and pointed out the following fresh damage: 1) Left
               side rear tail light was broken. 2) Fiberglass fairing was
               cracked on the left side above the rear tire. 3) Left side
               front turn signal was broken. 4) Windshield and fiberglass
               windshield frame was cracked. 5) Fiberglass fairing was cracked
               near the left side front turn signal. The damage is estimated
               to be $1000.00. I photographed the motorcycle, and the
               photographs were downloaded into Spillman and attached to this
               case. After speaking with Alvarez and examining the damage on
               the motorcycle, it appears that the motorcycle was knocked over
               and fell onto the ground, causing damage to the left side of
               the motorcycle. The motorcycle had not been hit by a vehicle,
               but instead, appears to have been damaged by someone
               purposefully pushing it over. No suspects or leads were
               identified. No further action at this time. Olmstead/339 I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of

               Danielle A. Anderson Victim 2. NARRATIVE: On 09/27/15 at
               approximately 1845 hours I was dispatched to Southside Dining
               for the report of a stolen cell phone, which occurred minutes
               prior to the call. Upon arrival I met with Trevor A. Vance
               (victim's boyfriend). Vance explained that the victim, Danielle
               A. Anderson, was going back to her dorm to retrieve a charger.
               Vance explained that Anderson left her cell phone at either the
               table she was eating, or the restroom when she went there.
               Shortly after she could not find her cell phone. Vance
               explained that they began tracking it and it showed that it was
               still in the building, but while tracking it the phone was
               turned off. I asked Vance if they checked the trash in the
               bathroom and he said they did. Anderson showed up and I
               explained the process of WSU IT tracking the device to both of
               them. I suggested they keep an eye on Craigslist for the phone
               as well. I provided both of them with my business card and case
               number. I spoke with the manager of Southside and asked her to
               have staff keep an eye on trash as well for the phone. I sent
               an email to WSU IT to track the device. No suspects or leads. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 27th day of September, 2015, in Pullman,

               Warned Smoking Marijuana NARRATIVE: On 09/27/15 at
               approximately 2210 hours I was on foot patrol on the west side
               of Scott Hall. I could smell the odor of marijuana and saw two
               male subjects near the bushes off the northwest corner of the
               building. I walked around the building and came through the
               bushes. As I neared the two I could smell a stronger odor of
               marijuana. I noticed they were the only two in the area. I
               shined my flashlight on them and noticed they both appeared
               under the age of 21. I asked them to sit down, which they did.
               I asked if either of them were 21 and they said no. I asked if
               either of them had a medical marijuana card and they said no. I
               asked why they would be smoking marijuana and they said because
               they were being stupid. I asked how much marijuana was left and
               one of the subjects, identified by WADL as Colin A. Johnson
               04/15/97, said about 5 grams. I asked Johnson where it was and
               he retrieved a bag from his right front pocket and handed it to
               me. I asked where the "piece" was and the other male,
               identified as Jacob D. Bauman 10/29/96, said he had it and
               removed it from his pocket and handed it to me. There was burnt
               marijuana residue in the bowl of the pipe. I asked them how
               much they smoked and they said about 2 bowls worth. I explained
               to them that I would be forwarding charges on Johnson for
               possession of marijuana and that I would send both to student
               conduct. I told Bauman that since the pipe still had marijuana
               residue in it I would not be returning it to him. I told them
               both they were free to go and we all left. I returned to WSUPD
               and NIK tested the marijuana. The result showed a presumptive
               positive result for Cannabis Sativa. I logged the marijuana
               into evidence and the pipe for destruction. Charges forwarded
               for possession of marijuana. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 27th day of

               regarding a civil issue. I contacted the complainant, Eden A.
               Kelshaw (060695), who told me she had an issue with her
               roommate. Her roommate invited her boyfriend to stay with her
               for the week. Kelshaw explained she does not feel comfortable
               with a male staying in the apartment or being in the apartment
               alone with her. The male is not a student and is just hanging
               out around the apartment during the day. I explained to Kelshaw
               the issue was one mainly between her and her roommate. Kelshaw
               said she knows her roommate a little but they are not really
               close. Kelshaw was trying to avoid having to tell her roommate
               directly she was uncomfortable with what was going on and was
               hoping there was a housing issue with guests. I told Kelshaw I
               believed the guest policy was they could stay up to five
               consecutive nights but she should check with her housing
               coordinator. I suggested Kelshaw speak to her roommate and
               explaining why she is uncomfortable with the situation. I told
               her the housing coordinator would be able to assist should it
               cause any further issues. Nothing further. I certify and

               approximately 0015 hours I saw a call on the screen of a hit
               and run that occurred in Moscow. I noticed the CAD comments
               said the vehicle was headed to Pullman. The vehicle was
               described as a 2014 Chevy Silverado with extensive front end
               damage. The plate provided was C61123D. I waited at the
               intersection of Forest Way and SR 270. At approximately 0030
               hours I saw a white 2014 Chevy Silverado travel west bound past
               my location. As I pulled out to catch up to the vehicle I
               noticed it slowed down and when the brake lights illuminated
               the center brake light did not come on. I caught up with the
               vehicle and noticed the plate matched the one provided. I
               initiated a traffic stop at Stadium and Main St. I contacted
               the driver and told him the reason for the stop. I asked for
               his license, registration, and proof of insurance, which he
               provided. The driver was identified by WADL as Theodore
               Baumgardner. Ofc. Engle (PPD) arrived on scene about this time.
               While I was speaking with Baumgardner he told me (unsolicited)
               that he had 3 beers at 2100 hours, but felt ok to drive.
               Baumgardner then told me that he got into a fight with his
               girlfriend. I asked if the fight was physical and he said no.
               Baumgardner said that he is just upset about the whole
               situation and was trying to go home. I asked Baumgardner if he
               would do some field sobriety tests and he said no. I asked
               Baumgardner if he would provide a breath sample and he said no.
               I asked Baumgardner if I could check his eyes and he said I
               could. I administered an HGN test with Baumgardner seated in
               the vehicle. I did not see any signs of nystagmus. I returned
               to my patrol car and Ofc. Engle told me he did not see any
               damage to the truck. Ofc. Engle cleared. I already saw the
               return for Baumgardner and he was clear and current. I called
               Ofc. Preston (MPD) and spoke with him. Preston said that there
               was damage to the victim vehicle and that Baumgardner had the
               victim's keys and needed them back. I returned to Baumgardner's
               vehicle and looked at it. I did not see any damage or paint
               transfer to the vehicle. I asked Baumgardner if he had the
               victim's keys and he said no. Baumgardner said that he had them
               around 2100 hours, but left them at the house. I asked
               Baumgardner if he did anything to the victim's vehicle and he
               said no. I asked Baumgardner if he hit the vehicle and he said

               no. I asked Baumgardner if he drove the vehicle and he said no.
               I looked in the back of Baumgardner's passenger seat and saw an
               open "half rack" of Kokanee beer. It appeared to still have
               several beers in it. I saw a women's purse on the floor board.
               I asked Baumgardner about it and he said it was the victims. I
               asked for it and Baumgardner gave it to me. I asked Baumgardner
               if I could search his vehicle for the keys and he said no. I
               walked around the vehicle and looked at the passenger
               compartments, but did not see the keys. Baumgardner moved
               things out of the way while I did this, so I pretty much was
               able to see everything in his vehicle. Baumgardner opened up
               his glove box and center consoles for me to see and I did not
               see the keys. I gave Baumgardner his information back and told
               him he was free to go. I transported the purse to Ofc. Preston
               who was still on scene in Moscow. I looked at the damage to the
               victim vehicle and did not see any paint transfer. It would be
               possible for Baumgardner to have caused the damage without
               causing damage to his vehicle. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               28th day of September, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: / WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE DEPARTMENT
               CASE #: 15-W4532 SYNOPSIS: Subject reported being raped in a
               dorm. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Ricky D. Martin
               Jr./092796 Suspect Rape 3rd deg 2. NARRATIVE: On 09/28/15 at
               about 0109 hrs Dispatch advised of a report regarding a
               possible sexual assault. The victim was at room 929 Stephenson
               South. I responded to room 929 and contacted the victim, Ana L.
               Valdez Torres (080797), who told me she had been drinking at a
               friend's room, who she knew as Ricky. Ricky was later
               identified as Ricky D. Martin Jr. (092796). She got highly
               intoxicated, from drinks that Martin provided to her in his
               room. Prior to drinking Valdez Torres told Martin she did not
               want to have sex with him. Valdez Torres said she was very
               clear about that. She said Martin then raped her in his room.
               As I was speaking with Valdez Torres I could smell the odor of
               intoxicants but she did not seem to be intoxicated or impaired
               to any degree. I explained to Valdez Torres her options
               concerning ATVP and going to the Hospital for a forensic
               examination. She agreed to have her friends drive her to the
               hospital for an examination. I drove to the Hospital and they
               followed. Once at the hospital I spoke with Valdez Torres's
               friend, Kenza Umar, who picked Valdez Torres up from Martin's
               room. Umar told me she received a phone call from a number she
               did not recognize. She answered the phone and it was Martin,
               saying that Valdez Torres was puking all over and crying. He
               told Umar to come get Valdez Torres. Umar went to Martin's
               room, 433 Gannon Hall. On the way there Martin texted Umar that
               they were going to need plan B. Umar arrived at Martin's room,
               where she found Valdez Torres laying on the ground. She said
               there was puke all over and Valdez Torres had it all over her.
               They began cleaning her up so they could leave with her. They
               asked Martin if he would get some paper towels. He went to the
               bathroom and returned with paper towels. Two other males who
               Umar did not know showed up at about this time. She was
               surprised that the two unknown males and Martin were acting as
               if this was a normal situation and nothing was wrong. When they
               found her Valdez Torres was wearing some of Martin's clothing.
               They saw a bra lying on the ground but it was covered in puke
               so they did not pick it up. As I was speaking with Umar she
               received several phone calls from Martin, which I asked her not
               to respond to or answer. Umar showed me a series of text
               messages on her phone from Martin in which he says " We're
               going to get the pill. You need to reply to me now. And she has
               a project tomorrow. Due. Kenza. She needs to take the pill.

               Think of Ana." A short time after speaking with Umar she got my
               attention again, saying she received a strange text message
               from a female named Mikayla, whom she did not know. In the
               message Mikayla said she heard what happened to Valdez Torres
               and did not want to force herself into the situation but felt
               she needed to speak with Umar and Valdez Torres. She mentioned
               knowing of stuff like this happening before. It was not clear
               if she was saying Martin had been involved in a situation like
               this before or if it was involving a different party. The phone
               number Mikayla texted from was (253) 468-6072. Initially Valdez
               Torres told the hospital staff that she did not want a forensic
               rape exam performed. It was clear Valdez Torres just did not
               want to have to make a decision about moving forward with
               charges at that time. I told her I understood the difficulty
               and said she did not have to make a decision at that moment. I
               told her she could decide at a later date after thinking about
               it for a while but some things, like the rape exam and any
               possible evidence in Martin's room were time sensitive. I
               explained if she went forward with the rape exam and provided
               me with some additional information so I could apply for a
               search warrant that would give her the most possible options in
               the future for her decision. Valdez Torres said she would have
               the exam done and provided me with some further clarification
               about what happened. She told me she was clear with Martin
               before she started drinking she did not want to have sex with
               him. She thought she began drinking at about 2130 hrs. By 2230
               hrs she became highly intoxicated and did not really want to be
               drinking but felt peer pressured into drinking. Martin began
               taking off Valdez Torres's clothing, at which point she
               verbally told him, "Don't". Martin continued removing her
               clothing and then had intercourse with her. Valdez Torres said
               Martin put his penis inside her vagina but she did not know if
               he ejaculated. She did not believe he used a condom. I provided
               Valdez Torres with the ATVP resources information packet and my
               business card. ATVP had already been contacted by the Hospital
               so I explained to Valdez Torres what the advocates did and how
               they could help her. I told her I would be having another
               officer follow up with her after a few days to see how she
               wanted to proceed with the case and if she remembered any
               additional information. I returned to the WSU Police Station
               where I applied for a search warrant to search room 433 Gannon
               Hall for evidence of the crime of minor in possession of
               alcohol and Rape 3rd degree. The search warrant, #092815, was
               granted by Judge Frazier. As I was printing the warrant after
               receiving it back from Judge Frazier I noticed at one spot in
               the search warrant it stated I was investigating the crime of
               possession of marijuana. I called Judge Frazier and the warrant
               was corrected to read the crimes of minor in possession of
               alcohol and 3rd degree rape. Corporal Kuhrt and I went to room
               433 Gannon Hall to serve the warrant. Upon arrival at the room
               I could smell the odor of vomit coming from the room. I knocked
               on the door several times with no response. I knocked twice
               more, announcing "Police, Search Warrant, Open the door" each
               time. There was no response so we keyed into the room, finding
               it unoccupied. I read the search warrant inside the room and

               the room was searched. There was a large area in the middle of
               the room covered with dried vomit and numerous paper towels
               strewn about. The bottom bunk was stripped of all the bedding.
               I located and seized the following items: 1. White Bra with
               vomit on it, found on the floor near the middle of the room. 2.
               Black running type shorts, found under the bed near the east
               desk. 3. 2 Sheets, found bunched up under the west desk. 4. 2
               Blankets, found bunched up under the west desk. 5. 2 pink
               socks, one found under the bunk beds the other was with the
               bunched up bedding 6. Fireball whiskey bottle, found on top of
               the east desk. 7. Indicia for Martin, found on the east desk.
               8. Clear plastic bag with trace amount of marijuana inside,
               found on the east desk 9. A red zip up sweatshirt, found draped
               over a chair back near the east desk/beds 10. Used Condom,
               found in a cardboard box near the east closet. The search
               warrant was amended by phone with Judge Frazier to include item
               #10. It appeared all of the bedding had been stripped off the
               bed and thrown on the floor under the west desk. One of the
               sheets seized was a grey fitted sheet the other was a white
               sheet blanket. One of the blankets was a black fleece type
               blanket with zebra stripes and the other was a black and yellow
               fleece blanket. The sexual assault exam kit was picked up from
               PRH and logged as evidence. As I was doing this the hospital
               staff advised Umar received about 8 text messages from the
               suspect. I have asked day shift to follow up with interviewing
               Martin, as well as trying to contact Mikayla, the two
               unidentified males, and Umar to see what information my be in
               the subsequent text messages she received. More to follow. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 28 day of September, 2015, in Pullman,
