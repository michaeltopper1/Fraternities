    Narrative: RVWD:MJG/309 / OFC: KDS/326 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W4091 SYNOPSIS: Report of a brown, 2001
               Toyota Sienna mini van stolen from the blue 1 parking lot.
               Victim refused to sign the stolen paperwork and was very
               uncooperative. He later called back and told me he misplaced
               his van and it was not stolen. Unfounded. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 091115 at
               approximately 1014 hours, I was dispatched to contact Loen T.
               Pham regarding a auto theft via telephone. I called Pham and he
               immediately began asking me who I was and who my dispatcher
               was. I told him that I wasn't sure which dispatcher took his
               call, but I could find out. Pham hung up on me. I called back
               and he answered. I explained that different dispatchers answer
               phones and others dispatch calls for service. I asked him where
               he was at so I could talk to him in person and he hung up on me
               again. A few minutes passed and dispatch advised that Pham was
               on 911 again asking if I was going to call him. I explained to
               dispatch that he hung up on me two times and to get his
               location so I could contact him in person. Dispatch told me
               Pham would meet me at the CUB information desk. Asst. Chief
               Hansen and I responded to the CUB and waited for approximately
               15 minutes before Pham arrived. Pham told me he was staying
               with a friend on the 5th floor of Orton Hall and at
               approximately 0930 hours, he parked his brown Toyota Sienna van
               WA/AVU6406 in the middle of the blue 1 parking lot near Chinook
               Apartments and walked in to Orton Hall. At approximately 0950
               hours, he returned and his car was missing. I asked him if he
               owned the vehicle outright or was making payments to a bank.
               Pham told me he was making payments to Bank of America and he
               had missed one payment. I asked him if he thought the car could
               have been repossessed by the bank and he told me he didn't
               know. At this point, Asst. Chief Hansen left the CUB and
               responded to the Blue 1 parking lot with Sgt. Macy to look for
               the vehicle. I continued talking to Pham and asked him if he
               thought of anyone else who could have taken his car. Pham told
               me he didn't. I asked Whitcom to attempt to locate the vehicle
               in DAPS. While I was waiting, I explained the stolen vehicle
               form to Pham and that I needed him to sign the form so I could
               put out to all agencies that the vehicle was stolen. Pham
               quickly told me he had to go and tried to walk away. I asked
               him to wait and he told me that his car was probably
               repossessed and that he needed to call the bank to find out. I
               gave Pham my business card and asked him to call me when he
               figured out what was going on. Pham told me he would. At

               approximately 1400 hours, I attempted to contact Pham and left
               a message for him to call me back. At approximately 1435 hours,
               he left a message on my voicemail stating that he had located
               his van in another area of the parking lot. He told me he just
               forgot where he parked. Case closed. I certify and declare

               he parked a WSU Bixi Bicycle (green bike) near the CUB on

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W4099 SYNOPSIS: Two vehicle collision in
               the driveway of Honors Hall. Information exchanged. Computer
               report. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 091115 at approximately 1508 hours, I was dispatched to a
               non-injury collision in the loading dock area of Honors Hall of
               Campus Street. Upon arrival I contacted, Camren J. Richards and
               Zhixuan Ye. I requested their driver's license, registration
               and insurance. Neither of them were able to provide insurance
               or registration upon request. I asked Richards what happened
               and he told me Ye was backing his car out of the parking space
               adjacent to where he was parked and he thought Ye was clear and
               Richards began backing straight. Richards told me he backed
               into Ye's passenger side door. Richards showed me his vehicle
               which was a 1997 GMC 1500 pickup. I was unable to locate any
               damage to the vehicle he was driving. It appeared the trailer
               hitch is what collided with Ye's vehicle. I took pictures of
               Richard's vehicle. I asked Ye what happened and he explained he
               was backing out of the stall so as to turn around. He told me
               he backed to his right and then was pulling forward to turn
               around behind Richard's pickup when Richards began backing and
               backed into his car. Ye showed me his 2011 Infiniti which had a
               large dent and gouging in the paint on the passenger side door
               and quarter panel. I estimated the damage to his car at
               $2500.00. I took pictures of Ye's vehicle. I completed the
               information exchange form in Sector and provided each with the
               other's information. I explained that since both claim to have
               insurance, and that neither of them had proof, that I was going
               to warn both for no proof of insurance. I explained that
               Richards could also be issued an infraction for improper
               backing causing a collision. I warned Richards for his
               violation and cleared. Nothing further. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               11th day of September, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               11-15 I was told my Sgt Macy there was a Sex Offense case
               holding. The victim was currently at Eastern Washington
               University talking to an officer Archie. He said Archie was
               waiting for a call. I called Archie and the following is what
               she told me. She said a Osha Morningstar had come into the
               department wanting to report a rape. During the conversation
               Morningstar disclosed on the 23 of August she had come to
               Pullman to meet a male named Antonio Martinez. The tow had met
               on craigs list and started talking and exchanging photos.
               Archie said the photos were explicit and sexual in nature.
               Morningstar said she had told Martinez she didn't want to have
               intercourse just fool around. The two went to the Marriott on
               the WSU Campus. The two got a room and went up to it.
               Morningstar told her one thing led to another and the two had
               intercourse both vaginally and anally. Martinez and Morningstar
               spent the night together the two went their separate ways.
               Archie told me she had not been able to see what was on
               Morningstars phone since it is old and thew screen is broken. I
               told her to tell Morningstar not to delete the messages. I
               asked Archie if she would get a written statement from
               Morningstar and tell her I would try and contact Martinez.
               Archie told me she would e-mail me the statement as soon as
               Morningstar was done writing it. I told her when I got the
               statement I would contact Morningstar. She said she would send
               the statement and a copy of her case and we ended the call. I
               found Martinez in Spillman and the WSU directory. I called him
               on his phone and he answered. I asked him if he would be
               willing to come speak to me. He said he would but was in Tacoma
               for drill. I asked him when he would be back in Pullman and he
               said on Monday. I asked him if he knew why I was calling and he
               said he didn't. I asked if he knew who Morningstar was and he
               said he didn't. I asked him if he had met a female and took her
               to the Marriott. He said he didn't. After several more
               questions Martinez admitted he knew who I was talking about. He
               told me he had sex with Morningstar and it was consensual. I
               told him that I wanted to continue the conversation in person.
               He said he would be back in town on Monday and would come in on
               Tuesday and speak with me. I told him to not delete any

               Pietila and Turner provided their ID's which identified them as
               under the age of 21. I asked the two how much marijuana they
               had. Turner said he had "two nugs." Turner then said, "I'll get
               it out for you" without me prompting him. Turner reached into a
               drawstring backpack and pulled out a glass jar with
               approximately 2 grams of marijuana in it. Turner reached out
               and handed me the marijuana without my asking. Based on my
               training and experience I easily recognized the substance to be
               marijuana. I told the two that they had been cooperative with
               me so I would be forwarding charges of possession of marijuana
               to the prosecutor instead of physically arresting them. I asked
               the two if I could search their backpacks and they said I
               could. During the search I seized a glass bong from Pietila, a
               glass pipe, metal grinder, and small amount of fresh marijuana
               from Turner. It was clear that both came to the hillside to
               smoke the marijuana. I thanked both for their cooperation and
               told them they were free to go. Once back at the station the
               marijuana NIC tested presumptive positive for Marijuana. The
               seized items were logged into evidence. Charges of possession
               of marijuana less than 40 grams will be forwarded to the
               prosecutor. END OF NARRATIVE I certify and declare under

               approximately 0002 hours I was dispatched to a noise complaint
               at the Chief Joseph Apartments unit A8. Upon arrival I found
               approximately 20 people standing around the entrance to the A
               building. Several people had open containers of alcohol. I
               knocked on the door of A8 for about a minute until Jylynn
               Asjhane Heads 12/16/94 answered the door. While knocking I
               could hear loud voices and loud bass music. When Heads opened
               the door I could see a large group of people inside. The air
               from the apartment smelled heavy of cigarette smoke. I asked if
               Heads lived in A8 and she said she did. I asked Heads for her
               ID and Heads said she would go get it. Heads returned with her
               ID several moments later. Heads was holding her ID and I asked
               if I could see it. Heads said, "I am reluctant to give it to
               you. Am I under arrest for anything." I told her that I needed
               her ID or have her provide her name so I could document who I
               was warning for the noise. Heads asked if she could tell me her
               name instead of handing me her ID. I said that was fine. I
               asked Heads what the difference was from me holding her ID and
               her providing her name verbally. Heads said, "I don't know if
               you understand the climate between African Americans and
               Police. I'm very apprehensive about that especially in the
               middle of nowhere Pullman." I asked Heads for her last name and
               she spelled it for me. I asked Heads what her first name was
               and Heads said, "LY I would like to keep it there." I told
               Heads I needed her legal name. If she was not going to provide
               it I would get it from the housing coordinator. I asked Heads
               if she was willing to identify herself and Heads said,
               "honestly I'm not." I told Heads that I would be back with a
               citation for the noise complaint in the next few minutes. Heads
               said I had told her that she was just getting a warning. I told
               Heads that since she was not cooperating with the warning
               process I would just issue a citation. I told Heads that if she
               was willing to fully provide her name I would just be issuing a
               warning. If not I would be issuing a citation. Heads provided
               her full name and date of birth. I verbally warned Heads for
               the noise violation. I remained in the area for a few minutes
               as the large party broke up. Heads will be referred to WSU
               housing and WSU Student Conduct for violations of the
               university's policies. Heads was respectful however

               09/12/15 at approximately 0033 hours I was dispatched to an
               unconsciousness call at Regents Hall room 359. Upon arrival I

               Veronica Macias 04/14/97, stumbling to her room earlier and now
               she was not responding when the RA knocked on the door. The RA
               believed that Macias had passed out so she called 911. I
               knocked on the door of room 359 for about a minute without an
               answer. The RED on duty keyed into the room and I found Macias
               laying facedown in her bed. I called out to Macias and she
               opened her eyes. I told Macias why I had been called and Macias
               said she was fine. Macias room smelled of vomit and I asked her
               if she had recently vomited. Macias said yes. I asked Macias a
               series of questions to determine her mental status. Macias was
               able to answer all my questions without hesitation. It was
               clear that Macias had been drinking but was not intoxicated to
               the point that she could not care for herself. I canceled the
               Medic's response and cleared. END OF REPORT I certify and

               Pullman PD believed the party noises were actually coming from

               found several parties that had just finished. There was
               approximately 30 people wandering around the parking lot being
               noisy. As they saw my patrol car most of the people cleared out
               of the parking lot. Seeing the the noise was subsiding I
               cleared. END OF REPORT I certify and declare under penalty of

               was gone upon my arrival. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR#
               1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 09/12/15 at approximately 0050 hours,
               medics were dispatched to the report of an intoxicated female
               in the lobby of Streit Perham. Dispatch stated that RA's were
               with the female. Due to the high call volume at the time of
               dispatch, an Officer did not respond. Several minutes later
               Dispatch radioed that the female had just left the lobby and
               got into a white pickup truck with a friend and left the area.
               I responded to Streit Perham and met with Devan Amar Williams
               10/30/95, who was the RA on duty. Williams said he came across
               the intoxicated female who was stumbling around the lobby. The
               intoxicated female will be referred to as subject X for the
               remainder of the report. Williams said the subject X looked
               pretty intoxicated so he called it in. Williams stated that a
               female friend of subject X walked up to her and told subject X
               that she had received an MIP before and she was not going to
               let that happen to subject X. The female friend walked subject
               X to her pickup truck and drove the two away. Williams said he
               could only describe the truck as a white pickup. Williams said
               that subject X appeared to know the female and did not appear
               in distress and she left with her. I canceled the medic's
               response and cleared the scene. END OF REPORT I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               Kemonee T. Jenkins 04/22/97 Arrested Brandishing 5Z1001717 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 09/12/15 at approximately 0105 hours I saw Ofc.
               Tiengo being flagged down near Northside Hall. As Ofc. Tiengo
               was being flagged down I noticed a call coming in on my MDC at
               Northside Hall. I radioed that I was out with Ofc. Tiengo and
               dispatch stated they had just taken a weapons offense call at
               our location. Travis J. Bogard 07/28/95 ran up to my patrol car
               and told me that a black male wearing a white jersey with the
               number 5 or 15 on it had a gun. Bogard is a WSUPD Intern and
               WSU Resident Advisor. Bogard stated he was told by residents of
               the situation. Bogard stated the male with the gun was last
               seen walking westbound on Cougar Way with the gun in his hand.
               Due to the proximity of Pullman Police Department's
               jurisdiction, I had dispatch notify them off the call. Ofc.
               Tiengo told me that he had been provided a similar story to
               Bogard's from the person who flagged him down. I drove
               eastbound on Cougar Way looking for the suspect. Ofc. Tiengo
               was driving behind me. By the time I reached Vahalla Bar I
               turned around and Ofc. Tiengo continued eastbound. I was
               driving westbound on Cougar Way when Ofc. Gordon of the Pullman
               Police Department stated he could see a male on Cougar Way
               matching the provided description. I pulled behind Ofc. Gordon
               and saw a black male wearing a white shirt with the number 5
               printed on the back of the shirt. The male, later identified as
               Kemonee Tre Jenkins 04/22/97, was walking with two females and
               one other male. Seeing that Jenkins matched the description
               provided, plus the time and proximity of the call, I had
               reasonable suspicion that the male was the person with the gun.
               Ofc. Gordon and I approached the two males and I ordered
               Jenkins to put his hands up. Jenkins did. I told Jenkins to get
               on the ground with his arms stretched out and he did. Ofc.
               Gordon handcuffed and detained the second male, later
               identified as Chrishawn Shamar Parker 08/05/96. I handcuffed
               Jenkins and asked if he had any weapons. Jenkins said he had a
               BB gun in his left front pocket. I found a full size black
               Smith and Wesson M&P 45 caliber in his left front pocket. The
               handle was sticking out of the top Jenkins pocket. I removed
               the gun from Jenkins pocket. I found no other weapons during
               the frisk. About this time Ofc. Harris of the Pullman Police
               Department arrived on scene. I handed Ofc. Harris the handgun
               to clear. I stood Jenkins up and had him sit on a cement block.

               I told Jenkins that he was not under arrest but being detained.
               I read Jenkins his Miranda Rights off my department issued
               card. Jenkins stated he understood his rights and having them
               in mind still wished to speak to me. About this time Ofc.
               McNannay of the Pullman Police Department and Ofc. Tiengo
               arrived on scene. Ofc. McNannay and Ofc. Tiengo interviewed the
               two females who were walking with Jenkins and Parker. I asked
               Jenkins what was going on with the gun. Jenkins said, "it was
               just in my pocket." I asked why it was in his pocket. Jenkins
               said, he had bought it in Lakewood, WA about two weeks ago. I
               told Jenkins that his answer did not explain why he had the gun
               with him tonight. Jenkins stated he was just walking around. I
               asked again why he would bring a gun with him and Jenkins said
               he did not know. I asked Jenkins how people would know that he
               had a gun. Jenkins said the gun does not fully fit in his
               pocket so some of the gun was sticking out. I put Jenkins in
               the backseat of my patrol car while the investigation
               continued. I contacted Ofc. Harris who confirmed the gun was a
               BB gun. Ofc. Harris handed me the BB gun and I secured it in
               the trunk of my patrol car. I spoke breifly with Ofc. NcNannay
               who had interviewed Niomi Kathryn Schill 05/10/97. Ofc.
               McNannay stated that Schill just met Jenkins several minutes
               ago when Jenkins was walking into the market under Global
               Scholars Hall. Schill had no knowledge of what had just
               occurred in front of Northside Hall. Ofc. Tiengo was
               interviewing witnesses near Northside Hall so I set up a show
               up area in the parking lot south of Northside Hall. I had
               Jenkins remain in the backseat of my patrol car and using Ofc.
               Tiengo's car I spot lit Jenkins. Once Ofc. Tiengo had the
               witnesses ready I had Jenkins exit the patrol car and look
               towards the light. After the witnesses looked at Jenkins he was
               placed back into my patrol car. I briefly spoke with the five
               witnesses who looked at Jenkins. The first witness I spoke with
               was Bailey Patrick Dugan 01/03/96. Dugan was one of the people
               who called 911. Dugan said he was walking on Cougar Way near
               Northside Hall when he saw Jenkins walking with Parker. Dugan
               stated he saw Jenkins with a gun in his hand that looked
               similar to to my duty gun. I asked Dugan to describe Jenkins'
               mannerisms with the gun. Dugan demonstrated that Jenkins was
               swinging the gun in his right hand in a normal walking stride.
               I asked Dugan if Jenkins had pointed the gun at anyone and
               Dugan said no, Jenkins was "just waving it around." I asked
               Dugan if Jenkins actions caused an alarm or fear for people
               safety. Dugan said everybody ran away and into the dorm because
               of the gun. I next spoke with Megan Elise Dierda 09/01/95.
               Dierda stated that she was walking with Dugan when she saw
               Jenkins with a gun in his right hand. Dierda said Jenkins had
               been swinging the gun. I asked about the swinging motion and
               Dierda also described the swinging to be a walking stride
               motion. Dierda stated Jenkins and Parker then walked towards
               Global Scholars Hall and that is when the two females started
               walking with them. Dierda described that Jenkins was walking
               parallel to them and then passed them which allowed her to see
               the gun. I asked Dierda on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being 100%
               sure, how sure was she that the person she just viewed was the

               person she saw with the gun. Dierda said she was "100% sure
               absolutely." I asked Dierda if she believed that Jenkins'
               action with the gun would cause a safety issue or panic. Dierda
               said yes especially since it seemed that Jenkins was yelling at
               someone on the balcony of Northside. I next spoke with Brandon
               Patrick Flora 10/21/96. Flora said he was walking with Dugan
               and Dierda but did not actually see a gun. Flora stated that he
               was looking up at his friend who was on the balcony of
               Northside Hall. Flora noticed that Dugan and Dierda started to
               quickly move to go into Northside. Flora did not know what was
               going on and one of the two told him that Jenkins had a gun.
               Flora only believed that Jenkins was the one with the gun
               because his friends had told him so. I next spoke with Courtney
               Jenelle Teshera 11/19/96. Teshera said she was headed into the
               entrance of Northside Hall to retrieve a jacket when she saw
               people running towards the building. Teshera became concerned
               that something was happening and started asking what was going
               on. Someone told Teshera that Jenkins had a gun so she began
               quickly trying to swipe her cougar card to open the doors to
               Northside Hall. Teshera said she followed Dugan, Dierda, and
               Flora to the balcony of Northside Hall where Jenkins was
               pointed out to Teshera. Teshera had seen Jenkins and Parker
               walking behind her just prior to going inside the dorm but she
               did not see a gun in Jenkins hand. I last spoke with Riley
               Lokahi Ellison 06/07/97. Ellison stated he was on the balcony
               of Northside Hall when he saw Dugan, Dierda, and Flora walking
               towards Northside Hall. Ellison yelled, "Kappa Sigma sucks" to
               Dugan and Flora to be funny. Ellison, Dugan, and Flora are all
               members of Kappa Sigma Fraternity. When Ellison said this,
               Jenkins looked up at Ellison and said, "what?" Ellison said
               this was the point that he saw Jenkins had a gun in his hand.
               Ellison stated that he did not want to cause more of a panic so
               he did not yell to his friends about the gun. Ellison stated he
               saw Dugan had recognized the gun and his friends began to get
               inside quickly. Once his friends were inside and on the
               balcony, Ellison told Dugan to call 911 since his phone was
               dead. I asked Ellison on a scale of 1 to 10, how sure was he
               that the person with the gun was the person I had in the back
               of my patrol car. Ellison said he was a 10 out of 10. I asked
               Ellison if he believed that Jenkins' actions caused a panic or
               a fear that something bad was going to happen. Ellison said,
               "yes sir." I asked Ellison if he saw Jenkins point the gun at
               anybody and Ellison said he did not. Ellison stated that
               Jenkins was just waving the gun around but not any higher than
               chest level. I asked Ellison if he saw where Jenkins put the
               gun and Ellison said he put it back in his pocket. I asked
               about Parker and Ellison said Parker was not doing anything but
               he also did not seemed phased that Jenkins had a gun out. Ofc.
               Tiengo remained with the witness to gather more information. I
               returned to Jenkins and told him he was under arrest for
               Brandishing. I told Jenkins that he was still being audio and
               video recorded and reminded Jenkins that his Miranda Rights
               were still in effect. Jenkins nodded his head in
               acknowledgment. I asked Jenkins to help me understand why he
               would walk down the street with a gun in his hand. Jenkins said

               he has been scared for his safety since a gun was pulled on him
               about two weeks ago in Lakewood, WA. I told Jenkins that I
               understood the idea of wanting a gun on him for protection even
               if I disagreed with it. However I did not understand why
               Jenkins thought it would be a good idea to walk down the street
               with it in his hand. Jenkins said he had it in his hand while
               he pulled up his pants. I asked why several people had reported
               him walking with the gun in his hand not pulling up his pants.
               Jenkins said he was walking with the gun in his hand while
               pulling up his pants. Jenkins continued to say that the gun was
               in his left pocket and causing his pants to fall down. Jenkins
               took the gun out with his right hand and pulled his pants up
               with the gun still in his right hand. I asked Jenkins why he
               could not pull up his pants while keeping the gun in his
               pocket. Jenkins stated that he felt the gun was the reason why
               his pants were being pulled down so he believed if he took the
               gun out and pulled up his pants, "that would help." I briefly
               spoke with the RED on duty and notified him of the situation.
               Ofc. Tiengo finished up his interviews as I transported Jenkins
               to the Pullman Holding Facility. Jenkins was placed in a
               holding cell until I could process him. Later in the shift I
               returned to Jenkins and issued him Sector citation 5Z1001717
               for RCW 9.41.270 displaying a weapon. I explained the citation
               to Jenkins and provided him with his copy. Jenkins was
               fingerprinted, photographed, and released from custody. Once
               back at the station the BB gun was logged into evidence. END OF

    Narrative: RVWD: Boyd/335 OFC: BRW/325 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W4123 SYNOPSIS: Male found unconscious in
               the lobby of Community Hall. Male was transported to PRH for an
               Alcohol Detox. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Ryan Q.
               Hayes 08/04/93 Protective Custody Alcohol 2. NARRATIVE: On
               09/12/15 at approximately 0209 hours I responded to a report of
               an unconscious male in the lobby of Community Hall. Upon
               arrival I found RAs standing over a male laying on the ground,
               later identified as Ryan Q. Hayes 08/04/93. Hayes' eyes were
               closed and I began to talk to him. I was able to get Hayes to
               tell he his first name but that was the only question he would
               answer. Once medics arrived they evaluated Hayes and determined
               he needed to be transported to PRH for an Alcohol Detox. I
               cleared when Hayes was loaded into the ambulance. Several
               minutes later I was asked by dispatch to respond to PRH
               regarding Hayes. Once I arrived at PRH I found Hayes in
               restrained to the hospital bed. Dr. Brown informed me that
               Hayes began to be resistive to medical staff and the medics
               assisted in restraining Hayes. Dr. Brown requested that I place
               Hayes in protective custody so they could continue treatment.
               Hayes was clearly unable to care for himself due to his very
               high intoxication level. I told Hayes that he was in protective
               custody and talked with him for several minutes to distract him
               as medical staff attended to him. Once medical staff were able
               to complete their tasks I cleared. A copy of the protective
               custody paperwork was added to the files folder. END OF REPORT
               I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws
               of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 12th day of September, 2015, in Pullman,
