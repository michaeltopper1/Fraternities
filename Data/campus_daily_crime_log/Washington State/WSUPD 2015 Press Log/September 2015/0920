    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Olmstead/339 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W4341 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched to a
               report of an unconscious female at the Yakama Village
               Apartments. The patient was transported to Pullman Regional
               Hospital. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 09-20-2015 at about 0725 hrs I was dispatched to a report of
               an unconscious female at the Yakama Village Apartments #617,
               located at 675 SE Forest Way. Dispatch advised that this was an
               "echo" response, and CPR was in progress. I arrived on scene
               and contacted Corporal Edwards, who was in the upstairs bedroom
               of the apartment. I observed an unconscious and unresponsive
               adult female laying on her back and on the floor of the
               bedroom. The female's shirt and bra had been removed and were
               on the floor near her head. The female was later identified as,
               Tanahi Q. Alsubaie (DOB 02-27-1995). Corporal Edwards had
               arrived shortly before me and was assessing Tanahi's condition.
               Corporal Edwards advised that Tanahi was breathing, and I could
               see Tanahi's stomach and chest moving up and down as if she was
               breathing. Also in the room was Tanahi's husband, Faisal F.
               Alsubaie (DOB 09-09-1991). There was no one else in the
               apartment. Pullman Fire Department personnel arrived on scene
               and began treating Tanahi. I questioned Faisal and asked him
               what had happened. Faisal said he returned to his apartment
               earlier that morning at about 0350 hrs. Faisal said Tanahi was
               upset with him for coming home late, and they argued. I asked
               Faisal why he came home late. Faisal said he was visiting some
               friends and smoking a hookah. Faisal said they continued to
               argue and were both in bed together. After some time, Faisal
               said he asked Tanahi to turn off the light on the nightstand.
               Faisal said Tanahi did not respond, and he noticed she was
               unconscious. Faisal said he moved her to the floor, called 911,
               and began CPR. I asked Faisal what time he noticed Tanahi was
               unconscious, and he said about three minutes before he called
               for help. I continued to question Faisal about the events that
               occurred in his apartment. I asked him if Tanahi fell while in
               the apartment or if their argument turned physical. Faisal said
               there was no physical contact between them during the argument.
               Faisal said Tanahi did not fall and was not injured. Faisal
               said Tanahi does not have any health problems and is not taking
               any medication. I did not observe any signs of physical injury
               on Tanahi. I checked Faisal's face, neck, and arms and did not
               see any signs of a struggle or physical injury. Tanahi was
               transported via ambulance to the hospital, and Faisal rode to
               the hospital in the ambulance. As Faisal was leaving the

               apartment, I asked him if I could look around his apartment and
               offered to lock it up for him. Faisal said this was fine and
               left me the key to the apartment. Corporal Edwards and I
               briefly looked around the bedroom and the interior of the
               apartment. Everything in the apartment appeared normal, and
               nothing was turned over, broken, or out of place. I noticed
               that the lamp on the night stand was turned on. I saw a pitcher
               of water with a few glasses on the nightstand. I noticed that
               the water had not spilled, and the glasses were not broken or
               tipped over. I did not see anything in the apartment that would
               lead me to believe a physical struggle had occurred between
               Faisal and Tanahi. Corporal Edwards and I exited the apartment,
               and I locked the door. I later returned the key to Faisal.
               Corporal Edwards contacted the next door neighbors and learned
               that the neighbors had heard Faisal and Tanahi arguing earlier
               that morning. Corporal Edwards responded to Whitcom and
               requested the recording of Faisal's 911 telephone call. See
               Corporal Edwards's supplemental narrative for more information.
               I responded to the hospital and contacted emergency room staff
               members. I learned that Tanahi had regained consciousness and
               was talking. Emergency room staff advised that they had
               communicated with Tanahi via an interpreter. Tanahi told them
               there was no argument between her and Faisal. Tanahi stated she
               remembered Faisal coming home late and then she was feeling
               dizzy. Tanahi stated she did not remember anything else until
               she woke up in the hospital. Emergency room staff advised that
               they had not observed any signs of physical injury on Tanahi
               and were continuing with their medical evaluations and tests.
               Emergency room staff said they would contact me if they
               discovered anything that might indicate a criminal act. I
               visited briefly with Faisal while at the hospital. I recalled
               that at one point in my earlier conversation with Faisal, he
               said Tanahi might have swallowed something. I asked him about
               this while we were talking at the hospital. Faisal said he
               thought Tanahi might have swallowed something because she was
               kind of coughing or choking when he was performing CPR. I
               concluded my conversations with Faisal and emergency room staff
               and cleared the hospital. Faisal said he has been married to
               Tanahi for two months, and they are from Saudi Arabia. Faisal
               is an engineering student at WSU. I reviewed the facts in this
               investigation and determined at this point, other than a
               sequence of strange and questionable events, there was no
               indication that a criminal act had occurred. My Vievu camera
               was activated during this incident. The video was downloaded
               into the permanent digital evidence file. No further action at
               this time. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this __20__ day of

               Apple iPad 2 as lost. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               2. NARRATIVE: On 09-20-15 at about 1449 hours I was dispatched
               to the report of lost property. Whitcom advised that the RP,
               Meshari M. Almotairi, was requesting phone contact regarding
               his lost Apple iPad 2. I called Almotairi at the phone number
               provided and asked Almotairi to explain what happened. He
               stated that on Friday, September 18th, he was in class in
               Abelson 201. He told me that he plugged his black Apple iPad 2
               into the wall using his charger. He said that he left his class
               and forgot about his charging iPad. He told me that when he
               returned the iPad was missing. Almotairi stated that he has
               checked with the lost and found at Abelson Hall and they did
               not have an iPad turned in. He said he wanted to make a report,
               just in case it was turned into the police department.
               Almotairi described the iPad as a second generation model,
               black in color, with a black leather case and a charger. He
               said access is password protected. He told me that he has
               checked the app "Find my iPhone" and his iPad is "Offline".
               Almotairi did not have a serial number for the iPad. I gave
               Almotairi my email address and the case number. I asked him to
               email me if he found his iPad and/or the serial number. He said
               he would. I asked Almotairi if he thought somebody stole his
               iPad and he said no, he believes it is just lost and was just
               wanting to make a report. Nothing further at this time. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Boyd/335 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W4357 SYNOPSIS: Report of a subject
               walking around the hall flicking a pocket knife open.
               Investigation determined the item seen was not a pocket knife
               but a zippo type lighter held by a resident. Case unfounded.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               09/20/15 at about 2244 hrs Dispatch toned out a weapon offense
               at Community Duncan Dunn Hall. Officer Stewart and I responded.
               The report was of an asian male with acne wearing black shorts,
               red shirt, and black zip up top. The male was last seen going
               into the east stairwell and was believed to have headed down
               the stairwell. Officer Stewart and I walked through the first
               and second floors, not finding anyone matching the description.
               We contacted the complainant, Anna J. Gleichman (102296), who
               told us she got up from a table in the hallway near the east
               stairwell and was headed to get some water when she heard a
               metal flick/click sound which she associated with the opening
               of a knife. She turned and saw the suspect standing near the
               doorway to the stairwell holding what she believed to be a
               knife, flicking it open and closed. The subject turned, going
               into the stairwell. She believed he went down the stairwell but
               was not completely sure. We contacted the Hall Director for
               Community Duncan Dunn, Richard A. Wallace (070390), who was
               able to provide us with card swipe data for the east stairwell.
               Based on the description and card swipe data there were two
               possible suspects. After contacting each of them we determined
               the individual seen by Gleichman was Alexander C. Elwell
               (021796). Elwell's cougar card was used to swipe back into the
               building through the east stairwell at 1035 hrs, which was
               shortly before the initial report to Dispatch was made. Elwell
               told me he was walking to the east stairwell to smoke. He said
               he often holds his lighter and flicks it open and closed
               repeatedly as he walks. I had him demonstrate the action and
               found it to be a similar action to what someone might do
               opening a folding knife. The lighter made a metal clicking
               sound also similar to the opening and closing of a pocket
               knife. Elwell said as he reached the east stairwell he saw a
               thin blonde female turn and look at him. He continued down the
               stairwell, still flicking his lighter, and looked back at her
               as he went down the stairs. I asked Elwell if he had any pocket
               knives in the room and he said the only one he had was one
               laying out on his desk. It was a rainbow colored knife. Officer
               Stewart photographed the knife and looked at it. He found the
               action to open the knife was quite stiff and would not allow

               the knife to be flicked open and closed repeatedly as described
               by Gleichman. We spoke to Gleichman and asked if she recognized
               Elwell. She said she did know him and had seen him since the
               incident. She said when she saw him making a cup-o-noodles he
               was wearing a grey top and shorts, which was what he was
               wearing at the time Officer Stewart and I spoke with him. She
               said he could have been the person she saw but was not sure due
               to the clothing differences. I asked if Elwell was sure what
               she saw was a knife and she said she was. I pulled out my own
               pocket knife, which has a 4.5 inch blade and 9.25 inch overall
               length. I asked if the knife she saw was bigger or smaller than
               mine and she thought it was slightly larger and black. I spoke
               to Elwell again and he said at the time he went out to smoke he
               was wearing grey/red shorts, a red shirt, and a black zip up
               jacket. He showed us the clothing and allowed Officer Stewart
               to photograph them. I asked again about a knife and he told me
               he did not have a pocket knife other than the rainbow colored
               one. He allowed us to look around his room and we did not see
               any pocket knives. I looked at the lighter again and noticed
               the outside was black but the inside of the lid was silver.
               Officer Stewart and I took the photographs to Gleichman who
               said she believed that Elwell was probably the person she saw.
               We told her he was insistant all he had was a lighter that he
               was flicking open and closed. She asked if the lighter was
               black and I said it was black on the outside but when open the
               inside of the lid and top of the lighter were silver. Gleichman
               said she must have mistaken the black and silver of the lighter
               for a knife. She thanked us for getting to the bottom of the
               issue and figuring out what happened. I spoke to Elwell one
               last time telling him the situation was resolved. I cautioned
               him he should probably keep his lighter in his pocket and not
               be flicking it open and closed due to the recent incidents in
               the hall involving a knife and the rumors spreading due to
               those incidents. He said he understood and would refrain from
               playing with his lighter in the future. The report was
               determined to be a mis-identification of a lighter and as such
               is unfounded. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 20 day of
               September, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W4360 SYNOPSIS: Graffiti written in black
               ink on the bathroom stall door on the third floor of Tood
               Addition. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 09-21-15, WSU Facilities Operations contacted Whitcom to
               report graffiti in the men's bathroom on the third floor of
               Todd Hall Addition. I responded to the men's bathroom on the
               third floor of Todd Hall Addition. I saw the letters "Crimm"
               and "RIP" written on the handicap bathroom stall door in what
               appeared to be black marker ink. The letters "Crimm" was
               written on top of the letters "RIP". There was also seven stars
               drawn on the stall door. I spoke with the janitor who said he
               the area on Friday (09-18-15) at approximately 1300 hours. He
               said the graffiti was not there when he left on Friday. He said
               he saw the graffiti at approximately 0615 hours on 09-21-15. I
               took photos of the graffiti and downloaded them into the Police
               Case File under the "Files" section of the case. There are no
               suspects or leads at this point so I recommend the case be
               closed. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 21st day of September, 2015, in
               Pullman, Washington. _______________________________________
