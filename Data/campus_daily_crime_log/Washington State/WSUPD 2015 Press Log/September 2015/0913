               Tang, Justin D. 102297 Student Conduct Threatening 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 09-13-15 I was dispatched to Community Duncan
               Dunn Hall for a cold threatening call. Upon my arrival I spoke
               with hall staff. They told me that a male resident, Timothy
               Moser, was told by a friend that another resident, Justin Lam
               Po Tang, say he was going to blow Moser's head off. I asked
               when the threat was made and they said on 09-10-15. There was
               also a rumor going around the hall that Justin had a crossbow
               in his room. Hall staff escorted me to the study nook and
               introduced me to Moser. I asked him if we could speak and he
               said it was fine. We went to the kitchen and closed the door. I
               asked Moser what was going on and he told me about the rumor of
               the crossbow. I asked him where he heard it and he said several
               residents were talking about it. I asked him if he had seen it
               and he said he hadn't. I asked Moser if he had any problems
               with Justin. He heard about the accusation Justin was a suspect
               in a knife case from last week, but didn't know him other than
               that. I asked him if he was scared of Justin and he said he
               wasn't. I asked about the threat. He said that there were
               several females in the hall that reported the threat to hall
               staff. He said if it was up to his he wouldn't have said
               anything. I asked him if he heard the threat personally and he
               said he hadn't. I told him that if he heard anything else to
               contact the police. He said he would and we ended the
               conversation. Hall staff and I went to Justin's room and I
               knocked on the door. Justin answered and I asked him if he
               would be willing to come to the hall directors office and speak
               with me. He said we would and we went to the first floor
               office. In the office was RED Wallace, R/A Norgaard, Justin and
               I. We all sat down and I asked Justin if he knew why I was
               there and he said he didn't. I explain to him about the
               accusation he threaten to Blow Mosers head off. He got very
               upset and adamantly denied making the threat. I explain to him
               the severity of making a threat like that and he again denied
               the threat. I asked if he knew Moser and he said he didn't. I
               asked him why someone would accuse him of making the threat and
               he again said he didn't make any threat. I asked Justin about
               the crossbow. He admitted to having the bow and didn't think
               there was anything wrong by having it. I explain to him the
               dangerous weapon WAC and he stated he didn't know it was wrong.

               I asked him what he did with the bow and he said he shot small
               game like rabbits and birds with it. I asked if he had a
               hunting license and he said he didn't have one. He asked why he
               would need one. I gave him a short explanation of Washington
               State Law when it concerned hunting. He said he understood and
               said he wouldn't do it again with out a license. I again asked
               him about the threat and he again said he hadn't made any
               threats. I asked if he would be willing to get the crossbow and
               give it to me for safe keeping. He said he would. We went back
               to his room and he retrieved the bow. I told him he would need
               to find a place to store the bow off campus. He said he would.
               I explain to him how to come get the item and he said he would
