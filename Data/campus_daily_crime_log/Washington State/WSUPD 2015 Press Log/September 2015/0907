               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W4004 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched
               to a request for a welfare check at the Residence Inn. It was
               determined that the subject was not at the hotel. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 09-07-2015 at
               about 1330 hrs I was dispatched to a request for a welfare
               check at the Residence Inn, located at 1255 NE North Fairway
               Road. Corporal Edwards and I arrived on scene and contacted the
               complainant, Sara L. Raquet (DOB 10-26-1973). Raquet is the
               general manager for the hotel. Raquet was concerned about a
               hotel patron who was staying in room #211. The patron was
               identified as Rebecca Ji (DOB 08-30-1950). Spillman also lists
               an alias for this individual, which is Qui M. Ji (DOB 11-09-
               1950). Raquet said Ji checked into the hotel a few days ago and
               used a credit card to reserve a room for seven days. Ji is
               scheduled to check out of the hotel on 09-10-2015. Raquet said
               Ji has been acting strange. Raquet explained that Ji covered
               all the electrical devices in her room with foil, covered the
               windows in the room, and insists on having the lights dimmed in
               the hotel. Raquet said Ji is acting paranoid and appeared to be
               under the belief that someone is monitoring her activities.
               Raquet said hotel staff found urine and blood on the bedding
               from Ji's room but not in an amount which would be considered
               an emergency. Raquet said Ji has been eating food in the lobby,
               ordered pizza one day, and appears to be taking care of
               herself. Raquet said on 09-06-2015 at about 1700 hrs Ji left
               the hotel in a cab and was supposedly enroute to Moscow, Idaho
               to do her laundry. Raquet said the hotel has not had any
               further contact with Ji. Raquet was concerned that Ji might be
               in her room and would be upset when hotel staff did a room
               check, which is authorized by the hotel's operating policy.
               Raquet explained that Ji had not violated the hotel's guest
               policy, and at this time, was allowed to continue staying at
               the hotel. Raquet said it appeared that Ji had stuck a piece of
               paper on the door to her room. The paper was positioned in a
               way that no one could enter the room without removing it, and
               it could only be placed on the door from outside the room in
               the hallway. After speaking with Raquet, it was decided that
               she would check the key card history for the room to determine
               if Ji had entered the room. Raquet did this, and determined
               that Ji's key card had not been used. Based on the fact that
               Ji's key card had not been used to enter the room, and the
               positioning of the paper stuck to the exterior of the door,
               Raquet believes that Ji was not in her room and never returned

               to the hotel. Raquet decided she would not do the room check at
               this time and explained that she would wait until Ji returned
               to the hotel. Raquet said she would call the police department
               if she has any difficulty dealing with Ji. Corporal Edwards and
               I cleared the scene. Dispatch searched the Moscow Police
               Department records and determined that Ji had not been
               contacted. My Vievu camera was activated during this incident.
               The video was downloaded into the permanent digital evidence
               file. No further action at this time. Olmstead/339 I certify

               the subject said his friend was getting better and they no
               longer needed an ambulance. The subject also had questions
               regarding the "good samaritan law". Officer Whitman and I
               responded. We located the subjects inside Stimson Hall at room
               332. I spoke to the subjects, who were not identified. They
               said their friend, later identified as Dante J. Thomas
               (051797), smoked a "dab" for the first time. Based on my
               experience I know a dab to be a term used for a small amount of
               marijuana concentrate. Thomas said they were watching American
               Sniper and things started going too fast and he started having
               a panic attack. He was able to calm down though and was feeling
               ok again. Thomas said he did not wish to be seen by medics so
               we cleared. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,

               Minor in possession of Marijuana 2. Kevin O. Smith (062595)
               Warned Minor in possession of Alcohol NARRATIVE: On 090815 at
               approximately 0015 hours, I was driving on NE Valley Road
               passing Providence Court Apartment parking lot when I noticed
               the vehicle in front of me appeared to have expired tabs from
               July of 2015. I followed the vehicle and asked Whitcom to run
               the registration on the vehicle. As the vehicle approached
               Brandi Way, I could see that that month tab read July and the
               year tab was 2015. I activated my overhead emergency lights and
               the vehicle pulled into the Steptoe Village Apartment parking
               lot near the W building. I activated my VieVu body camera and
               contacted the driver who identified himself as Kevin O. Smith
               with his WADL. Smith immediately was acting very nervous and
               fidgety. I asked him how much he had to drink and he told me he
               hadn't had anything. I asked him if he had smoked marijuana and
               he told me he hadn't. I smelled a strong odor of fresh
               marijuana coming from the vehicle and asked Smith how much
               marijuana was in the vehicle. Smith initially told me there
               wasn't any marijuana in the vehicle. I explained that I smelled
               a strong odor of marijuana coming from the vehicle and that I
               knew there was marijuana. I asked both subject how old they
               were and they both stated they were 20. I asked Smith for
               permission to search his vehicle and he initially told me he
               didn't want to let me search his vehicle. He told me he didn't
               know what to do and asked if he had to let me search his car. I
               explained that he didn't have to let me search, but that I can
               ask for permission and he could grant permission to search. I
               told him he could refuse consent and I would likely seize his
               vehicle and apply for a search warrant from the courts. I
               advised him that a search warrant may or may not be granted,
               but if it were, I would be granted to search his vehicle. I
               told him that either way, he would likely not be going to jail.
               Smith told me I could search his vehicle. I told Smith and his
               passenger to exit his vehicle and his passenger, later
               identified as Donald D. Gardner, pulled out a plastic bag that
               contained green vegetable matter. Gardner set the bag on the
               center console and exited the vehicle. Outside the vehicle I

               explained to both that they could revoke or deny consent to
               search, they could limit the scope of the search, and that they
               could stop the search at any time. Smith told me I could search
               his vehicle. WSUPD Intern Drew Chapman and I searched the
               vehicle. I located a plastic bag of several marijuana buds
               sitting on the center console. Intern Chapman located an
               unopened can of Rolling Rock beer under the rear seat behind
               the driver's side. Gardner told me that the marijuana was his.
               I explained that I was going to forward charges to the
               prosecutor on him for possession of marijuana less than 40
               grams. I told Smith to pour out the beer and that I was going
               to give him a warning for minor in possession of alcohol. more
