               harassing voicemail message left on a WSU phone. The

               that). I listened to the message that was left. There were no
               direct threats made. It is unknown who left the message. The
               message has been added to Spillman Files. Nothing further. I

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3884 09/02/15 SYNOPSIS: Suspicious
               device at Fulmer Hall. It was found to be a tool used and owned
               by WSU Facilities Operations. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On September 2, 2015 at about
               0912 hours I was dispatched to a reported suspicious device at
               Fulmer Hall. The device was described by Whitcom as a "PVC
               pipe, 2ft long, the ends are capped and a small battery sized
               looking thing 5-6"high by a couple inches long." The device was
               said to be located on the 2nd floor by the north entrance. Cpl.
               Edwards and I responded to the building. When we arrived there
               were people exiting both Fulmer and Chemical Synthesis
               buildings. A fire alarm was sounding from Fulmer. Whitcom
               received an alarm from Chemical Synthesis. Whitcom advised that
               WSU Life Safety personnel were working on the alarm at Fulmer.
               We located a small black bag with wires coming out of it on the
               second floor near the west stairwell. The bag was sitting next
               to large vertical ventilation pipes in the hallway. I
               photographed the item from the stairwell hallway and did not
               approach the bag. Cpl. Edwards and I met with Quint Jacobs, WSU
               Life Safety outside of Fulmer. I showed him a photograph of the
               item. He immediately said that was his equipment and that is
               where he left it. Jacobs said he set it down to use the
               restroom. Jacobs described the device as a battery in the bag
               that powers a small halogen light mounted on the end of the
               pole. The tool is used to test heat detectors. We went back
               into the building with Jacobs and confirmed that the suspicious
               object was actually his tool. There was no threat. Jacobs
               removed his tool from the hallway. WSU Facilities Operations
               personnel were testing detectors in Fulmer. The fire alarm
               system was not operational when the testing is occurring,
               however there is a WSU Life Safety technician at the alarm
               panel at all times when the system is down. I was told the Life
               Safety technician at the panel was asked by building occupants
               to activate the fire alarm system after several pull stations
               were activated without the alarm sounding. Life Safety manually
               activated the alarm in Fulmer. They did not activate the alarm
               in Chemical Synthesis. It was activated off by a pull station.
               In summary there was no actual emergency at Fulmer or Chemical
               Synthesis. A tool was mistaken to be a suspicious device. The
               fire alarm system did not activate when pull stations were
               pulled due to routine fire alarm system maintenance/testing
               happening in the building. Sgt. Macy and Assistant Chief Hansen
               were briefed on incident. I recommended that the tool be

               similar. The building is safe to occupy and people were let
               back in. A WSU Alert message was sent out via text notifying
               people that it was safe to be in the building. No further
               investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 2nd day of August, 2015, in

               missing person. The individual was located. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Werbin, Tyler J (06/26/97) Located 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 09/02/15 around 1741 hrs I was dispatched to a
               report of a possibly missing person from Rogers Hall. Upon my
               arrival I spoke with the Hall Director, identified as Ross A
               McClure (12/30/86), and was told the following. McClure
               explained he had a student, Andy C Johnson (112196), contact
               him regarding his roommate Tyler J Werbin (06/26/97). According
               to McClure Werbin has not been back to his room since early
               Monday (08/31/15) and Johnson was a little concerned. McClure
               tried contacting Werbin on his cell phone and found it went
               straight to voicemail. After not receiving any response McClure
               checked the activity log on Werbin's student ID card and found
               all activity stopped during the day of the 31st. At this point
               I asked McClure where Johnson was currently located and was
               told he was in his room (729) which he shares with Werbin. Upon
               contacting Johnson I learned Werbin has kept him informed about
               his plans and for him to completely cease contact was odd.
               Johnson went on to tell me it did not appear anything was
               missing or had been disturbed. I asked if Werbin had anything
               else going on and was told he had recently broken up with his
               girlfriend, Melanie Marshall, at which point he added he had
               already messaged her and asked if she had heard from Werbin.
               Johnson received a response from her and told him she had not
               had any contact with Werbin. Around this point Whitcom asked me
               to contact them and upon speaking with them I was informed
               Werbin appeared to have been transported to Pullman Regional
               Hospital on 08/31/15 and from what they could tell looked like
               had been transported to St Joe's medical center located in
               Lewiston Id. I asked them to contact St Joe's and and see if
               Werbin was there. At this point I told McClure and Johnson I
               may have located Werbin, but I would need to check on a few
               things and let them know. Shortly after this I cleared and
               returned to the WSU Police Department where I contacted
               Werbin's home phone number and spoke with Heidi K Werbin
               (06/19/79), who identified herself as Werbin's mother. Upon
               speaking with Heidi I learned Werbin had been transported to
               St. Joe's on 08/31/15 and was currently still there. As we
               continued to speak I was also told Werbin had been transported
               to PRH following his contacting WSU Counseling Services. I
               asked about what there plan was for returning to WSU and was
               told it was currently up in the air and more decisions would be

               made once Werbin was closer to being released. I asked Heidi
               whether or not Werbin decided to remain in school they contact
               McClure upon their return to WSU so a plan could be formed
               moving ahead. She told me she would do that and I provided her
               with my contact information in the event she had any questions
               or concerns I might be able to help with. Prior to concluding
               our conversation she thanked me for the help and we concluded
               our call a short time later. Following my conversation with
               Heidi I contacted both McClure and Johnson and told them Werbin
               had been located. I explained to McClure I had asked Heidi to
               contact him upon Werbins return to campus. He thanked me and we
               concluded our call a short time later. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of

               approximately 2249 hours I was monitoring traffic on Stadium
               Way from the Cougar Statue when I noticed a BMW 330I heading
               southbound on Stadium Way. The BMW appeared to be traveling
               faster than the posted 20 MPH zone. I activated my handheld
               radar and obtained a reading of 29 MPH. As the BMW passed me I
               pulled behind it and initiated a traffic stop at Stadium Way
               and Grimes Way. I contacted the driver, Alden Jose Paguada
               Reyes 08/05/82, identified myself, informed Reyes I was
               recording, and explained the reason for the stop. I asked Reyes
               for his driver's license and he said he did not have it with
               him. I asked Reyes if he had any other form of ID with him and
               Reyes provided me with his WSU Cougar Card and date of birth
               verbally. Reyes provided me with his vehicle registration but
               could not find a current proof of insurance. I returned to my
               patrol car and ran Reyes through dispatch. Dispatch stated
               Reyes' driver's license had expired on 08/05/15. I filled out a
               Sector citation and returned to Reyes. I had Reyes speak to me
               outside the car. I explained to Reyes that his license was
               expired. Reyes said he did not know that it had expired. I
               explained the law of No Valid Operator License without ID to
               Reyes and provided him with his citation. I told Reyes that he
               was free to go but cautioned him about driving until he renewed
               his license. END OF REPORT I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 3rd day of September,

               reporting the odor of marijuana coming from room 425. Upon
               arrival I could smell the odor of burnt marijuana coming from
               within the room. I knocked on the door and four males were

               were free to go but they were being referred to student conduct
               for their involvement. Dworsky, James, and I walked to the
               dumpster where they destroyed their illegal items. I explained
