               has been attempting to communicate and contact his ex
               girlfriend on campus. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               2. NARRATIVE: On September 24, 2015 at about 1333 hours I was
               dispatched to Ferdinand's for a report of harassment. I
               contacted the complainant Yevette Meza (05/04/95) in person as
               requested. Meza told me she had dated a male named Adam
               Martinez when she was a freshman in high school in Royal City,
               WA. Meza dated Martinez for the school year. She said he was a
               senior in high school at that time. When they broke up Martinez
               kept attempting to contact her. In about 2012, Meza's father
               had to step in and tell Martinez that she did not want further
               contact. Meza blocked Martinez on social media as well as her
               cell phone. She estimates it has been over a year since he last
               attempted contacting her. Meza has never made a report to the
               police until today. On Monday, September 21, 2015 at about 1130
               hours Meza was approached by Martinez in the CUB. She was
               surprised to see him as he is a student at the University of
               Washington. Martinez wanted to sit and talk with Meza about
               having a dating relationship. He told her he is in town for the
               week visiting a friend. Meza did not want to speak with him or
               have contact with him. She told him she didn't want to talk and
               to leave her alone. Martinez said he would leave her alone
               forever if she took a letter from him. Meza took a three (3)
               page handwritten letter from Martinez and left the area. She
               showed me the letter. In it Martinez rambles on about wanting
               to have a relationship with her. There were no threats made to
               harm Meza in the letter. It appeared to me he was seeking
               closure and forgiveness in his writings. Today, Thursday,
               September 24, 2015 Meza was working at Ferdinand's. At about
               1245 hours Martinez came into the business. He quickly looked
               around and left. Martinez then came in again for a second time
               about twenty (20) minutes later. This time he tried to approach
               Meza who was working behind the counter with other employees.
               Martinez mumbled something and then sat down. Meza doesn't know
               what he said. She said she was looking down doing some work.
               Martinez did not order any food or drink. He just sat there for
               a short period of time and then left. Meza reported the
               incident to her supervisor. Meza told me she feels "unsafe" and
               "scared to be alone." She doesn't think Martinez will hurt her.
               She went on to tell me that he is "obsessive and unstable."
               Meza did not have contact information or a date of birth for
               Martinez. She said he is about 5 foot 5 inches tall, 120

               educated Meza on protection orders, personal safety, and campus
               resources including WSU Counseling Services and the Dean of
               Students Office. I gave her my business card with the case
               number and a list of resources on the back of the card. I
               provided a courtesy transport from Ferdinand's to her vehicle
               in a nearby parking lot. No further investigation at this time.

               was on Olympia Ave near Rogers Hall when I saw a male bent over
               and leaning against a tree. I turned around and contacted the
               subject, later identified as Morgan G. Mannon(051297). A friend
               he was with said he ate something bad and was sick. Mannon said
               he missed his parents and was crying. I could smell an odor of
               intoxicants coming from Mannon and his eyes were watery. I
               asked Mannon how much he had to drink and he said he had not
               been drinking. I then asked how old he was and he said he was
               eighteen. I asked to see his ID. Mannon gave me his California
               driver's license. I asked Mannon where he was drinking and he
               again said he was not drinking. I asked Mannon to breath into
               my hand and I could smell an odor of intoxicants coming from
               his breath. I asked Mannon if he would take a preliminary
               breath test and he said he did not want to. I asked he would
               take an eye test, He said he would. I asked him to stand with
               his feet hands at his sides. As he got into that position
               almost feel over. While I was doing the HGN I could see a lack
               of smooth pursuit in both eyes and a distinct and sustained
               nystagmus at maximum deviation. Mannon was also swaying while I
               was conducting the test. I explained to Mannon I was not going
               to forward charges to the prosecutor, I was going to warn him
               tonight and forward my report to student conduct. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under

               determined he was not a danger to himself. Nothing further.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               09/25/15 at about 0109 hours dispatch advised a father of a
               student received a message from his son that made him fear for
               his sons well being. The message said "pray for me" and had an
               emoticon of a gun and a crying face. The father, Omar Frost,
               had not received any other communication after the message and
               he was concerned. Corporal Kuhrt and I went to room 416 in
               Perham Hall where Lamar Frost lives. We knocked several times
               at the door and no one answered. We then contacted the RED on
               call and I called Omar Frost. Omar told me he received the
               message via Facebook messenger. Omar also said there were a
               couple of videos that Lamar posted on Snapchat that concerned
               him. He said the video were of his son saying that he had no
               one to support him. I asked Omar if he could tell where the
               videos were recorded and he said they were recorded in his sons
               dorm room. RED Earl Lee arrived at Perham Hall and we all went
               back up to room 416. I knocked again twice and announced that
               it was the WSU Police. There was no answer. I keyed into the
               room. The room was in disarray, there was a chair tipped over
               and mattress on the floor. There was also a broken cell phone
               and clothes scattered about the floor. It appeared there was a
               person laying under one of the mattress on the floor. Corporal
               Kuhrt moved the mattress and found Lamar asleep. He got up and
               it appeared to take a few minutes to wake up. I told him we
               were there because his father was concerned about his well
               being because of the message he sent. Corporal Kuhrt asked if
               he wanted to hurt himself. Lamar said he did not, he was just
               stressed because of school. We talked to him for awhile and
               determined that he was not a danger to himself. Lamar said he
               had been drinking because he was stressed and then went to
               sleep. Lamar also stated he did not have any weapons in his
               room and allowed us to search his areas of the room. We found
               no weapons. Hall staff was informed of our discussion and
               stated they did not need to talk to Lamar. Lamar stated he
               wanted to clean his room and would be all right. I gave him my
               business card and explained there were phone numbers on the
               back for resources he could use if he needed assistance.
               Corporal Kuhrt offered to let Lamar call his Dad since he did
               not have a cell phone, Lamar declined. I told him I was going
