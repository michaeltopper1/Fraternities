               paint in several locations. There was one long spray line on

               harassment at Regents Hall. Subject did not want police
               involvement. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Marcus ???
               2. NARRATIVE: On 09/29/15 around 1845 hrs I was dispatched to
               Regents Hall for a report of possible harassment. Upon my
               arrival I contacted the complainant, identified as Kathleen M
               Hincheliffe (01/18/97), and was told the following. Hincheliffe
               initially did not want to speak with me and upon explaining to
               the her and the resident advisor I needed to get the
               information from her she told me she has been getting harassed.
               I asked her to explain what she was referring to and was told
               she had been receiving phone calls from a male she later
               identified as Marcus, whom she described as a black male, 6-03,
               and muscular. She went on to tell me Marcus would contact her
               by phone and regularly changed his number so she would answer
               due to her blocking his other numbers. When asked about this
               male all she would tell me was he was currently a student at
               WSU and lives in an apartment, the location of which she did
               not know. Hincheliffe also added she believed Marcus was in the
               nursing program, but was not certain. I asked how she knows
               Marcus and she explained she met him through friends, but would
               not go further than that. I asked her again about Marcus and
               his last name and was told she didn't know. I sugested if he
               was friends of her friends she could contact them and obtain
               this information. Hincheliffe looked at me and did not respond
               immediately before acknowledging she could. At this point I
               asked her what I could do to help her and was told Marcus had
               contacted her and told her he would be at the dorm in
               approximately 10 minutes from when she contacted us. I told her
               I did not see anyone matching that description when I was
               responding or upon entering the building to contact her.
               Hincheliffe did not seem pleased and was not forthcoming with
               answers to my questions at which point I explained we were here
               to help her and ensure her safety. Shortly after this I asked
               her again how I could help her and she told me she did not want
               any of this and did not wish to speak with the police. I told
               her that was her option and we discussed the possibility of
               obtaining a restraining order and how to do that, even if she
               did not wish to speak with us regarding what was going on. She
               simply nodded and prior to clearing I provided her with my
               business card and case number, explaining she could call any
               time and any of the officers would have access to my report and
               would try to help her. She nodded and I left a short time

               later. Upon my return to the WSU Police Department I searched
               the online directory for anyone named Marcus. I located an
               individual, Marcus R Barrow, which matched the description
               Hincheliffe had given me earlier and contacted her. Upon
               reaching her I asked her if I showed her a photograph of an
               individual if she could tell me if it was Marcus or not. She
               told me she could identify him, but she was busy and did not
               want any involvement. I told her if she changed her mind to
               give me a call and she told me she would. Nothing further at
               this time. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true

               dispatched to a report of drugs in room 839 Rogers Hall. Upon
               arrival, I contacted Justeen A. Montelongo who told me she
               received a report from the Resident Advisors of the hall that
               room 839 smelled strongly of marijuana when the resident of the
               room closed the door. I went to room 839 and knocked on the
               door. Jonathan W. White answered the door and I immediately
               smelled a strong odor of fresh marijuana. White was the only
               person in the room at the time. I explained to him that I
               smelled a strong odor of marijuana coming from the room, and I
               asked him if he had a medical marijuana card. He told me he
               didn't. White explained that the marijuana was not on his side
               of the room and told me that all the marijuana was his
               roommate's. I asked White to call his roommate and ask him to
               respond back to the room. White did as requested and I waited
               for his roommate, Morgan G. Mannon to return. When Mannon
               returned, he provided me with his ID and told me he didn't have
               a medical marijuana card. I asked Mannon if White had any
               involvement with the drugs in the room and he told me he
               didn't. I explained to Mannon the two options we had in dealing
               with the situation. I explained he could voluntarily offer to
               get the marijuana and destroy it or he could refuse and I would
               apply for a search warrant for the drugs. Mannon told me he
               would get the marijuana and destroy it. Mannon entered his room
               and pulled a small plastic bag of marijuana out of a drawer. He
               told me he usually smokes with friends and doesn't have any
               paraphernalia. I escorted him to the outside of the building
               where he destroyed the marijuana. I explained the conduct
               process to Mannon and he was released from the contact. Forward
               to WSU Student Conduct. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 30th day of

               approximately 2256 hours, I was advised of subjects possibly
               smoking marijuana behind Stephenson South. Ofc. Stewart and I
               arrived and I contacted the RP, RED Cooper, while Stewart
               checked the area. Cooper told me he had just seen a group enter
               the building and walk into room 223, the room he had called in
               earlier in the night. I went to room 223 and could smell the
               odor of marijuana emitting from the room. I knocked on the door
               and eventually they answered the door. There was four people
               inside the room and there appeared to be a light haze in the
               room. I told them why I was there and asked who owned the room.
               William Strub stated the room was his. I asked everyone for
               their identification and the other three were identified as
               Nicholas Lindseth, Dakota Juarez, and Kenneth Howard. I told
               Strub to get the marijuana and anything used to smoke it and we
               would destroy it outside. I told all four their names would be
               sent to Student Conduct. I could see Strub's eyes were
               bloodshot, and he appeared to be under the influence of
               marijuana. He stated he only had stems and bags left. I told
               him to collect it all and he gathered two bags with gvm residue
               in them and some empty beer cans he stated his brother had left
               in the room over the weekend. I verified Strub was not a
               marijuana patient. I advised him of the consequences of further
               contacts for marijuana and made sure he was aware of the laws
               and rules regarding marijuana. I told the other three they
               could leave and escorted Strub outside to the dumpster. All the
               items were disposed of in the dumpster. I cleared. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.
