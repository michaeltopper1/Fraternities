               The vehicles involved had pulled off of Stadium Way and into
               the driveway between Gannon and Wagner Halls. After verifying
               there were no injuries the following story was learned. The
               white Dodge Caravan (Veh 2) was traveling north bound in the
               inside lane of Stadium Way. The Green Mitsabeshe Mirage (Veh 1)
               was traveling behind Veh 2. Veh 2 came to a stop for a
               pedistrian, who had just step off the east side of Stadium Way
               into the crosswalk. The crosswalk is located close to the
               driveway between Gannon and Wegner Halls. Veh 1 did not stop
               quick enough and struck the back of Veh 2. I certify and

               NARRATIVE: On 091015 at approximately 2051 hours we were
               dispatched to the report of a dozen or so people trespassing in
               a classroom in the CUE. Ofc. Tiengo and I responded. I met with
               the RP, Kevin D. Cochrane (121264), a custodian at the CUE. He
               said a group had a reservation for room 416 until 2000 hours.
               He said that they are not to remain in the room after the
               completion of the reservation. He showed me a document that
               stated that is somewhat ambiguous terms. He confirmed that no
               one else had the room reserved after 2000 hours and that the
               building was to be open until 2300 hours. Room 416 was also not
               a locked/secured room. I informed him there was not a
               trespassing situation but that it would be beneficial to have
               the building hours posted at the entrances. I contacted the
               people in the room who were all quietly studying. I told them
               they were okay to stay but to leave at 2300 when the building
               would be locked. They were completely cooperative. I cleared.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W4085 SYNOPSIS: Subject arrested, cited,
               and released for MIP Exhibiting and Making False or Misleading
               Statements to a Public Servant. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Jillian J. Walkowski 06/17/97 Cited/Released
               MIP Exhibiting 5Z0998231 False Statements 2. NARRATIVE: On
               09/11/15 at approximately 0037 hours, I was driving eastbound
               on Cougar Way when I noticed a female, later identified as
               Jillian Jensine Walkowski 06/17/97, sitting on the bench area
               in front of Global Scholars Hall. Walkowski drew my attention
               because she was staring straight ahead with a dazed blank look
               upon her face. I pulled to the side of the road by the gyms to
               keep an eye on Walkowski. Walkowski was sitting with her elbows
               rested on top of her knees and her head in her hands. As
               Walkowski sat that way he elbows kept slipping off her legs
               causing her head to fall forward. I decided to get out on foot
               and I parked my patrol car in the parking lot just east of
               Global Scholars Hall. As I exited my car I noticed that
               Walkowski had stood up and was now slowly walking towards me.
               Walkowski was stumbling side to side as she walked. Walkowski
               reached a metal bench near the green space east of Global
               Scholars Hall. Walkowski put her right hand on the top of the
               bench for support as she looked into a planter section. While
               standing Walkowski was again swaying even though she was being
               supported by the bench. I continued to walk towards Walkowski
               and she bent over and began vomiting in the planter. As I
               neared Walkowski she lost her balance while bent over and went
               head first into the dirt planter. Walkowski stood up and was
               facing away from me. I stood a several feet behind her for a
               few moments as she stumbled in all directions before deciding
               to sit down on the armrest of the bench. Walkowski was now
               facing me and she appeared to be well under the age of 21 years
               old. I asked Walkowski if she was doing ok and Walkowski said
               yes as she wiped some vomit off of her mouth. I told Walkowski
               that I saw her just vomiting and Walkowski said that she had
               just ate some bad food. I asked Walkowski if she had her ID
               with her and Walkowski said no. I asked Walkowski what her last
               name was and Walkowski said and spelled, "J E N K I N S." I
               asked Walkowski to spell her first name and Walkowski said, "H
               A L E L Y." I asked Walkowski what her middle name was and
               Walkowski said, "ummmm Sue." Walkowski looked away from me as
               she thought about her middle name which I recognized as an
               indicator of deception. I asked for Walkowski's date of birth
               and she provided 06/12/97. About this time Ofc. Whitman arrived

               on scene. I handed Ofc. Whitman my notepad so he could run the
               name Walkowski had provided. I asked Walkowski how much she had
               to drink and Walkowski said, "I did not have any." I asked
               Walkowski if I could look at her eyes and she said I could. I
               instructed Walkowski to stand with her heels and toes together
               while keeping her hands at her sides. I told Walkowski to
               follow the tip of my pen with her eyes only while keeping her
               head still. Walkowski said she understood. During the test I
               observed equal pupil size, equal tracking, lack of smooth
               pursuit, and distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum
               deviation in both eyes. Walkowski eyes were watery and
               bloodshot. During the test Walkowski was swaying forwards and
               backwards to the severity that she lost her balance and
               stumbled backwards. The bench behind Walkowski stopped her from
               falling over. As Walkowski stood before me I could smell the
               odor of intoxicants coming from her breath. I told Walkowski
               that balance disruption, odor of intoxicants on her breath, and
               nystagmus in her eyes, were not signs of food poisoning but
               rather alcohol consumption. I again asked Walkowski how much
               she had to drink and Walkowski said one beer. I told Walkowski
               that she had consumed much more than just one beer and again
               asked Walkowski how much she had drank. Walkowski said she had
               two beers. I asked Walkowski a series of questions to determine
               her mental status. Walkowski was able to answer all my
               questions correctly. I asked Walkowski if she was willing to
               provide a PBT sample and she said she would. Once it was time
               of Walkowski to provide a sample Walkowski said, "no I honestly
               want to go to bed" and attempted to walk past me. I grabbed
               Walkowski by the arm and told her she was under arrest. With
               the assistance of Ofc. Whitman we were able to handcuff
               Walkowski without incident. Due to Walkowski inability to
               balance I had her sit down on the bench. Ofc. Whitman told me
               that there was no return for the name Walkowski provided. I
               told Walkowski that she was being audio and video recorded and
               read Walkowski her Miranda Rights off my department issued
               card. Walkowski said she understood her rights and did not want
               to talk to me. I told Walkowski that because she had provided
               me with a false name I would have to take her to the holding
               facility where she would remain until she decided to provide
               her real name. Walkowski quickly said, "I will tell you." I
               asked Walkowski for her last name and she provided and spelled
               it correctly. I asked for Walkowski first name and she began to
               dry heave. I asked if she wanted to go back to the grass and
               she said yes. Ofc. Whitman and I walked Walkowski over to the
               grass where she began to vomit again as Ofc. Whitman and I held
               her up. After Walkowski was done vomiting I sat her down on the
               bench again. Walkowski was able to provide me with the rest of
               her name and date of birth. I ran Walkowski information through
               dispatch and her return came back clear. I walked Walkowski
               over to my patrol car so I could fill out a Sector citation for
               her. Once at my patrol car I had Walkowski sit on a bench while
               Ofc. Whitman stood by. Once I completed the citation I walked
               over to Walkowski and Ofc. Whitman. I noticed another female
               was now sitting next to Walkowski. The second female was
               identified as Hayley Noel Jenkins 12/09/96. Jenkins lives

               across the hall from Jenkins. It was now clear that Walkowski
               had used Jenkins information in an attempt to conceal her
               identity. I explained the Sector citation to Walkowski and
               provided her with her copy. Walkowski was released into Jenkins
               custody and they walked towards Streit Hall where they both
               lived. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 11th day of
               September, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               NARRATIVE: On 09-11-15 at approximately 0050 hours I was on
               patrol in the area of Nevada St., when I observed a male run
               across the street and hunched over near some bushes outside of
               Waller Hall. It appeared like he was throwing up in the bushes.
               The male then continued to walk southbound on the sidewalk on
               Nevada St. The male was swaying, and he was unable to walk in a
               straight path. I contacted the male on Nevada St. near Stadium
               Way, who appeared to be under the age of 21. The male later
               identified himself as Chandler E. Holt (DOB 04-16-95). I asked
               Holt if he was throwing up in the bushes, and he said no. He
               told me he had a "lugee" he was spitting out because he was
               coming off of a sickness. I asked him how much he had to drink
               tonight, and he said he had a couple beers. Holt told me
               multiples times he was just trying to head back to Rogers Hall.
               His speech was slurred, and as he stood still his body swayed
               in a circular motion. I asked Holt to blow on my finger, and he
               did. I could smell the strong odor of intoxicants coming from
               Holt's breath. I asked Holt if he would be willing to take a
               voluntary PBT, and he said no. I advised Holt I was audio and
               video recording, and he seemed to understand. Ofc. Petlovany
               soon arrived on scene as backup officer. I asked Holt where he
               was drinking tonight, and he told me at his fraternity, Delta
               Tau Delta. I told Holt I believed he had more than just a
               couple of drinks tonight, and he finally said he had three or
               four beers. Holt told me he was drinking Busch Light. I told
               Holt I would be forwarding charges on him for minor exhibiting
               the effects of consuming alcohol in a public place to the
               Whitman County Prosecuting Attorney's Office. I also told him I
               would be referring him to WSU Student Conduct. Holt seemed to
               understand. I told Holt he was free to go. Ofc. Petlovany and I
               cleared the scene. Holt was cooperative throughout the entire
               contact with him. No further action. My Vievu camera was
               activated, and the video was later downloaded into the
               permanent digital evidence folder. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 11th day of
