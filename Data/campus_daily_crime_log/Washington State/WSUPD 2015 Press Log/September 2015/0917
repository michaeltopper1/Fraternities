               Fire and WSU Police were dispatched to a male feeling faint
               near Kimbrough Hall. I responded to the area and contacted the
               male near the front doors of Kimbrough. The patient said he had
               been up for two (2) days studying at the library for a test
               today. He has not been eating well and has been drinking a lot
               of caffeine. He said he felt dizzy and light headed. Pullman
               Fire personnel spoke with the patient. The patient decided not
               to go to the hospital by ambulance. He wanted to go to WSU

               to Student Health as it was raining. While en route to Student
               Health the patient changed his mind and asked to be transported
               by ambulance to the hospital. I met Pullman Fire at WSU Student
               Health and transferred the patient to their care. He was
               transported to Pullman Regional Hospital by ambulance. No
               further investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the

               dispatched to a non-injury collision in the Childrens Center
               parking lot. Upon my arrival I saw a silver Ford and a Gold
               Chevrolet sitting in the parking lot by the door. I could
               clearly see damage to the passanger front passanger door and
               the rear bumper area of the Ford. I also saw that the front
               windshield was broken. The Chevrolet had damage to the drivers
               rear bumper. I photographed the damage then entered the
               building. I spoke with the drivers of bothe vehicles Zeng and
               Lawrence stated that they were leaving the parking lot Zeng was
               in the far left spot and Lawrence was two spots to the right.
               Zeng backed out and stopped to start going forward. Lawrence
               started backing and began turning as she backed to make the
               corner easier. She didn't realize Zeng was there and she struck
               her with her drivers rear bumper. I asked Zeng if all the
               damage to her vehicle was caused by the collision and she said
               the only damage was to the front door. The other damage was
               already there. No one was hurt in the collision. Lawrence
               admitted she was a fault in the collision. The two exchanged
               informartion and I cleared the scene. I later downloaded the

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W4250 SYNOPSIS: Report of a possible
               juvenile runaway on campus. It is believed the juvenile is in
               the Everett area. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               Stuart, Jada A (10/22/97) Not located Juvenile Runaway 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 09/17/15 around 1633 hrs I was asked by Lt Larsen
               to look into an email he had received regarding a possible
               runaway juvenile, Jada A Stuart (10/22/97), staying with a
               friend identified as Dyonte L Law (11/29/96). The email, which
               I later attached to this case, explained Stuart has been
               missing since 08/20 and my be with Law. After reviewing the
               email I determined Law lives in room 1127 Rogers Hall and
               called hall staff for Rogers Hall. Upon reaching them I was
               told Stuart was not listed as a registered guest and they had
               not heard anything about her being in the building. I thanked
               them and emailed Kelly Stuart, Jada's mother, requesting she
               call me so I could obtain more information. I also contacted
               Snohomish County and requested a copy of their report, which I
               later added to this case. After a short period of time I
               contacted Law and asked him about Stuart. We had a brief
               conversation during which time he told me he did not know where
               she currently was. As we continued to speak he later agreed to
               meet me at the WSU Police Department and upon contacting him I
               learned the following. Law again told me he has not seen or
               spoken with Stuart in about a week, and when asked for her
               phone number I was told he did not have it. When I inquired
               about this I was told Stuart only communicates with him via
               snapchat and he does not know where she is or how to get in
               touch with her. As we continued to speak I explained I was
               concerned and at this point wanted to have a conversation with
               Stuart if possible. Law then told me from what he did know
               Stuart was still in the Everett Washington area but he did not
               know who she was staying with. He went on to tell me she had
               broken up with her boyfriend some time ago and since that point
               he doesn't have a clue where she is, only that she has told him
               she it all right. I asked if he has asked her where she is
               staying, and told he has. Stuart has refused to tell him where
               she is at, again adding only she is all right and safe. Upon
               hearing this I asked why his name would have been brought up as
               a possible place where Stuart might go. Initially Law told me
               he had no idea, but as we continued to discuss this issue more
               I was told he used to communicate with her approximately 3-4
               times a week during the summer before he came to school. I
               again asked about how to contact Stuart at which point Law told

               me to the best of his knowledge Stuart does not have a cell
               phone, and shut down all of her social media accounts with the
               exception of snapchat. He went on to tell me she uses an I-pod
               to communicate, which she kept secret from her parents. We
               discussed the seriousness and possible issues related to
               helping hide Stuart and I was told he understood and would
               contact me if he learned anything or heard from her. Nothing
               further at this time. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 17th day of

               hours, I was on patrol when I observed a vehicle stopped in the
               roadway of Nevada near Washington with it's hazard lights on. I
               contacted the driver and asked if she was having car problems
               and she said yes. She stated her car was over heating. She said
               she put water in it earlier, but now it had a funny burned odor
               and she was afraid to drive it. She stated she could try and
               put more water in it and I told her I would watch the vehicle
               for her while she got some water. A few minutes later she
               returned and when she went to put water in it, I observed the
               reservoir was full. I also noticed the drive belt was off and
               appeared to be broken. I pointed it out to her and she called

               figure out what she was going to do with the vehicle and she
               said that would be fine. We moved the vehicle and she called
               AAA to get a tow. She stated it would take and hour for them to
               arrive, and she was going to remain with the vehicle until
               then. I advised her to call if she needed any further
               assistance and she stated she would. I cleared. I did not

               later identified as Aranda Riveragxiola (06/28/97) and was told
               the following. Riveragxiola explained she had been walking from
               the greek row area to Regents Hall when she realized she had
               dropped her phone, which she described as a gold colored I
               phone 6. She attempted to retrace her route and did not locate
               the phone before trying to call it. Once she called the phone
               she told me it was answered by a female who told her something
               to the effect of "good luck getting the phone back" before
               hanging up. Riveragxiola attempted to locate the phone and
               found it was not currently active, at which point she locked
               out the phone remotely. I asked her to get me the serial number
               information for the phone and give me a call when she had it so

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W4257 SYNOPSIS: Report of an
               inappropriate poster found in the elevator of Stephenson East.
               Poster determined to be a joke between friends. No crime
               occurred. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Robert T.
               Hartley 05/05/97 Contacted 2. Kyle J. Martin 05/23/97 Contacted
               NARRATIVE: On 09/18/15 at approximately 2114 hours, I was
               dispatched to a harassment case at Stephenson East. Upon
               arrival I contacted Madeline H. Marsh 04/16/95, who was the RA
               on duty for the night. Marsh said she found a racist poster in
               the elevator during her rounds. The poster background was a
               "Black Lives Matter" rally with text over the top of the
               picture. The text asked if anybody had seen their black friend
               and if so to call "1-800-HOTLINEBLING." The poster had two
               handwritten Twitter username of "Kylrthecreator" and
               "PussykillaRob." Marsh did not know who had put the poster up.
               I returned to the station and by using social media I found
               "PussykillaRob" was actually Robert Taku Hartley 05/05/97 and
               "Kylrthecreator" was actually Kyle John Martin 05/23/97. I
               returned to Stephenson and contacted Hartley at his door room
               207 Stephenson South. I knocked on the door and Hartley
               answered. I asked if we could talk and Hartley instantly asked
               me if this was about the posters. Hartley stated that it was a
               joke by him and his friend "Kyle." Hartley said that their
               other friend was not returning their calls and so he "had been
               missing" for a few hours. Hartley said all three of them were
               talking about the "Black Lives Matter" movement earlier in the
               day so they thought it would be funny to make posters that
               their friend would find on his way home. I had Hartley walk me
               over to "Kyle's" room. Kyle was found to be Kyle J. Martin.
               Once at Martin's room I explained the situation and Martin
               provided a similar story. I told the two that some people could
               take offense to the posters due to the recent racial tensions
               with the "Black Lives Matter" groups. Hartley and Martin stated
               they understood but their intent was to play a joke on their
               friend. Hartley stated they put up approximately 5 to 6 posters
               throughout the building so their friend would see it. I told
               the two that it would be a good idea to remove the posters.
               Both agreed. There was no crime committed only violations of
               the WSU housing policies. With RA's happy with the resolution,
               I cleared. There was no crime committed and the harassment can
               be closed out as unfounded. END OF REPORT I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               Both vehicles had already been ticketed. Officer responded and
               was able to contact one of the owners of the vehicles and it
               was moved. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 09-17-15 at approximately 2257 hours I was
               dispatched to the report of a parking problem located at NE
               Stadium Way and NE North Fairway Rd in the yellow parking lot.
               Dispatch advised there were two vehicles parked in the lot that
               was blocking an RV from parking for tailgating. I arrived on
               scene. I contacted John W. Hankins (DOB 09-04-68) in front of
               his RV. There were two vehicles parked nearby in parking
               spaces, and both vehicles already had parking tickets on them
               for improper permit/no permit. There was a silver, 2003
               Volkswagen Passat (WA Lic. ARF3000) and a white, 1999 Toyota
               Avalon (WA Lic. ABG3635). I took photographs of both vehicles,
               and the photos were later uploaded into Spillman. Dispatch
               advised the Volkswagen returned to a Richard D. Grimm (DOB 05-
               29-87) and there was a phone number for him. I called Grimm on
               the phone, but there was no answer so I left him a voicemail
               telling him to move his vehicle. The Toyota returned to a
               Monique A. Ebberson, but there was no phone number available
               for her. I returned to the station to see if Grimm had returned
               my phone call. As soon as I arrived Ofc. Welter informed me
               Grimm had called and he was an his way to move his vehicle. As
               soon as I returned to the RV lot the Volkswagen had been moved,
               but the Toyota was still there. I told Hankins since the
               vehicle is legally parked I would not be able to tow it.
               However, I provided him with parkings phone number and I told
               him he could contact them in the morning if the vehicle was
               still there. I cleared the scene. No further action. My Vievue
               camera was activated, and the video was later downloaded into
               the permanent digital evidence folder. I certify and declare

               Beck told me he believed there were still people in the room
               and we walked down the hallway towards room 134. As we neared
               the door I noticed the odor of marijuana growing stronger. I
               knocked on the door, which was eventually answered by an
               individual I recognized as Dakota J McFadden (11/08/96). I
               immediately noticed McFadden was nervous and as we continued to
               speak I noticed the odor of marijuana was growing stronger and
               coming from inside the room. I asked McFadden if he knew why I
               was there and initially he told me he had no idea at which
               point we had a brief discussion on this issue. McFadden
               eventually admitted he knew why I was there and I asked him who
               else was in the room. He told me his roommate, later identified
               as Jacob E Monroe (03/05/97), and another individual, later
               identified as Jesse B Jaspers (11/26/96), were also in the
               room. I asked Monroe to come to come speak with me and after a
               brief conversation I was invited into the room and upon
               entering all three individuals were identified. McFadden
               explained the marijuana was his and all three individuals
               admitted to having been smoking in the room prior to my
               arrival. He went on to tell me he was having severe
               difficulties since the death of his roommate, which was where I
               met him previously. We later spoke on this issue and he told me
               of his desire to potentially leave school. We discussed some
               other options and I told him it would be a good idea to speak
               with a counselor regarding his current difficulties. He told me
               he was pretty sure he wanted to go home and be near family. I
               told him he needed to do what was in his best interest and
               continued to discuss this issue and offered to speak to him

               whenever he felt he needed to. After a brief discussion I asked
               him if there was any remaining marijuana left in the room.
               McFadden told me he had a little bit left, which he volunteered
               to destroy. I spoke with all three individuals, who were
               compliant, and warned them for possession of marijuana. Each of
               them told me they understood and McFadden and I exited the
               building where he destroyed the remaining items and marijuana
               while Jaspers and Monroe spoke with Hall Staff. Upon our return
               McFadden spoke with Hall Staff and I cleared a short time
               later. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 18th day of
               September, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.
