               identified as Austin H.S. James (062796), who appeared to be
               under 21 and was stumbling as he walked. As he came through the

               and ID card on the ground. He continued to stumble as he came
               up the stairwell from Student Plaza to Gate I. I contacted
               James and asked how much he had to drink. James denied

               him. James spoke with slurred speech. He was verbally
               uncooperative but eventually admitted to being 19. I advised
               James he was under arrest for MIP Exhibiting and placed him in
               handcuffs double locked. I advised him he was being recorded
               and search incident to arrest I located a Washington Driver's

               the processing room where I read him his miranda rights from a
               pre-printed card. I issued him a criminal citation for MIP
               Exhibiting. I explained the citation to him, and he received
               his copy. I read him an ejection notice and provided him with a
               copy of the notice. James was released and escorted from the
               Stadium. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty

               WSU vs Portland State football game at Martin Stadium. I
               observed a male, later identified as Timothy J. Rice, walking
               up the stairs near gate I. Rice was using the wall beside the
               stairs to maintain his balance. As he reached the top of the
               stairs and walked towards me I asked him to come over and talk
               to me. Rice staggered as he walked. I asked him how much he had
               to drink he said not much. I asked him how old he was, he said
               he just turned 20. Rice's speech was slurred and I could smell
               an odor of intoxicants coming from his breath. I asked Rice if
               he would do an eye test for me, he said he would and then
               changed his mind and said he would not. I told Rice I was not
               going to allow him to enter the game, and that I would be
               forwarding charges to the prosecutor on him for minor
               intoxicated in a public place. I asked if he was going to
               cooperate and walk to the processing room with me. Rice said he
               was not going to cooperate. I placed Rice under arrest and
               handcuffed(DL) him. I informed him he was being audio and video
               recorded. I then escorted him to processing. In the processing
               room I searched Rice and got his driver's license out of his
               wallet, which confirmed his date of birth was 09/05/95. I began
               to fill out paperwork and Officer Boyd read Rice his rights.
               When Officer Boyd asked if he understood his rights, Rice
               shouted "fuck you". Rice refused to give his local address.
               Officer Boyd read him the trespass warning to Rice explaining
               that he was not allowed back in or near Martin Stadium for the
               remainder of the day. I issued a criminal citation(#5Z0980651)
               for minor intoxicated in public and explained it to Rice.

               released him. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury

               2. NARRATIVE: On 09/05/15 at about 1147 hrs I was working at
               the WSU vs PSU football game. I was walking in the outer
               concourse near section 30 when I noticed a male, later
               identified as Jonathan N. Wiley (091996). Wiley caught my
               attention because he appeared to be under 21 and was having
               extreme difficulty walking. He was bumping into numerous people
               as he walked as well as using the wall for balance. I contacted
               Wiley as he exited the men's bathroom near section 31. I asked
               how much he had to drink and he said, a little bit. I could
               smell a very strong odor on intoxicants on his breath as he
               spoke. I asked for his ID but he initially said he did not have
               it with him. I asked how he got in the game and he said he just
               walked in. Eventually he pulled his wallet out of his pocket
               and provided me with his Washington State Driver's License,
               which confirmed he was under 21. I administered a horizontal
               gaze nystagmus test on Wiley. I observed he had bloodshot and
               watery eyes, a lack of smooth pursuit, and a distinct and
               sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation. I advised Wiley he
               was under arrest for MIP exhibiting and that he was being
               recorded. I escorted him to the processing room where I read
               him his miranda rights from a pre-printed card. I issued Wiley
               a criminal citation for MIP Exhibiting. I explained the
               citation to him and he received his copy. I read Wiley an
               ejection notice and provided him with a copy of the notice.
               Wiley was escorted out of the stadium and released to a sober
               friend who was waiting. Nothing further. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3970 09/05/15 SYNOPSIS: Infant
               accidentally fell while being put into a car seat. Taken POV to
               the hospital. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On September 5, 2015 at about 1300 hours Pullman
               Fire and WSU Police were dispatched to the report of a three
               (3) month old infant who fell while being put into a car seat.
               We were dispatched to the Washington Building. Cpl. Daniels and
               I responded to the area. Cpl. Daniels was flagged down by the
               parents of the infant. They were taking their child to the
               emergency room at Pullman Regional Hospital. Cpl. Daniels and I
               followed them to the hospital where we made contact. According
               to the parents the mother was unstrapping the infant from a
               front chest carries when she slipped out and fell to the
               ground. I was told the fall was two (2) to three (3) feet. The
               infant may have hit her head. I am not exactly sure where the
               incident happened as the father said he drove from the "old CUB
               to the hospital (Washington Bldg)". The father had not been
               back in Pullman for some time and thought the hospital was
               still at the Washington Building. I observed the infant in the
               hospital. She was crying, moving and acting like an infant. I
               saw no obvious marks, bumps or bruises. The child appeared to
               be well cared for and thriving. I assisted the parents by
               getting their 5 and 2 year old girls from their vehicle and
               watching them while the parents were with the doctor. The
               siblings were well cared for and thriving. This appears to be
               an accident. No further investigation. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               5th day of September, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               the restroom. We asked if the resident returned to his room,
               and they said they believed so, but were not positive. Ofc.
               Westerman and I knocked on the door multiple times, but there
               was no answer. We could see the light was left on in the room,
               but we did not hear anybody inside. We could both smell the
               strong odor of marijuana emitting through the crack in the
               door. The Resident Advisors informed us the only individual
               that lives in room #324 is "Andrew Endsley" (DOB 01-04-95). We
               cleared the scene. Student will be referred to WSU Student
               Conduct. No further action. My Vievu camera was activated, and
               the video was downloaded into the permanent digital evidence
               folder. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 6th day of September, 2015, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer

               possession of marijuana, possession of alcohol by a minor, and

               5Z0982750 Poss. of Alcohol Poss. of Dangerous Weapon NARRATIVE:
               On September 5th, 2015 at approximately 2241 hours I was
               monitoring traffic on Stadium Way from Johnson Hall when I
               noticed a silver Toyota Scion sedan heading northbound on
               Stadium Way. The vehicle appeared to be traveling faster than
               the posted 20 MPH zone. I activated my handheld radar (Decatur
               Scout 2013) and obtained a reading of 29 MPH. I watched as the
               Toyota accelerated to 34 MPH near North Fairway. The Toyota
               turned left onto Cougar Way and I caught up to the Toyota near
               Northside Hall. I turned on my emergency lights and the vehicle
               pulled into the access road between the Soccer Field and Global
               Scholars Hall. I contacted the driver, Christian Scott Moss
               12/28/94. Moss had just lit a cigarette in an attempt to cover
               up the overpowering odor of burnt marijuana coming from the
               car. I told Moss to put his cigarette out and he did. Moss
               provided me with his WADL. I asked for proof of insurance, and
               vehicle registration. Moss stated it was the back passenger's
               car, Jeremiah Dorce Gates 01/20/95, stated the car was his. By
               checking the registration I confirmed the Toyota was registered
               to Gates. While standing at the door I could see a black metal
               grinder in the center console which based on my training and
               experience I recognized as used in smoking marijuana. There
               were a total of 5 occupants in the car. I asked if anybody was
               over the age of 21 and they all said no. I asked if anybody had
               a medical marijuana card and again they all said no. I asked
               Moss if he could hand me the grinder and he did so. Inside the
               grinder was a small amount of marijuana. I could also see a
               plastic bag that had been next to the grinder. I asked to see
               the bag and Moss pretended to look around and covered the bag
               with a black sweatshirt. I again told Moss where the bag was
               and he kept looking. On the third time I asked if I could see
               the sandwich bag Moss handed it to me. Inside the sandwich bag
               was approximately one gram of fresh marijuana. About this time
               Ofc. Tiengo arrived on scene. Ofc. Tiengo stated there was a
               case of beer in the back seat. I had Moss exit the car and talk
               to me away from the group. Once outside of the car I frisked
               Moss for weapons due to airsoft gun already located. No weapons
               were found on Moss. I asked about the marijuana and Moss said

               it wasn't his. Moss stated he just got in town and is not a WSU
               student. I asked Moss if anybody in the car was a WSU student
               and Moss said no. I next spoke with Gates and asked him to exit
               the car. As Gates exited I noticed a 40oz bottle of malt liquor
               at his feet on the floorboard of the car. Once outside of the
               car, Gates was frisked for weapons. None were found. I told
               Gates that since he was the owner of the car everything must
               belong to him correct. Gates said no. I read Gates the Ferrier
               Warnings and Gates stated he did not give his consent to search
               the car. I read Moss and Gates their Miranda Rights of my
               department issued card. I asked the remaining 3 passengers to
               exit. The three were identified as James Terry Favor 11/25/97,
               Jazmine T. Smith-Parisi 10/30/98, and Erika A. Landen 08/21/99.
               I told everybody that they were free to go however the car was
               being seized to apply for a search warrant. Landen and Parisi
               wanted their purses out of the car and I told them that was
               fine as long as I could search them. Both said that was fine
               and nothing illegal was found in the purses. I again told
               everybody they were free to go and I would give them a call
               when I was done. Gates stood around and I spoke with him a bit
               longer during our conversation Gates asked what was going to
               happen. I told Gates that I was planning on issuing a citation
               to the people the illegal items belonged to. Gates asked if he
               received a citation would he have to come back to Pullman. I
               told Gates yes. Gates became upset and said something to the
               effect of, "I don't care about the citation" and continued to
               say, "I'm not driving five hours out here just for court." At
               that point it was clear that Gates was not planning on
               returning for court. Ofc. Tiengo remained with the car while I
               went back to the station to apply for a search warrant. I
               applied for and was granted a search warrant by Judge Robinson.
               After the search warrant was granted I returned to the car. I
               arrived back at the car at 0016 hours. I saw Gates, Moss, and
               Favor standing in the area so I called them over so I could
               read the search warrant to Gates. After reading the warrant to
               Gates I handed him his copy. Gates then purposely dropped the
               warrant on the ground because he did not want it. I told Gates
               to put it in the recycling bin next to him so he was not
               littering. During the search of the car the following items
               were seized: -Black metal grinder -Sandwich bag of marijuana -6
               pack of mikes hard lemonade -1 40oz of Old English malt liquor
               -12 pack of bud light premium -1 spring assisted knife -1
               plastic container with a small amount of marijuana concentrate
               Gates was placed under arrest and handcuffed (D/L). Ofc. Boyd
               advised Gates that he was being audio and video recorded and
               read Gates his Miranda Rights off his department issued card. I
               told Gates that I could release his car to one of his friends
               if he wished. Gates decided to have me give the keys to Moss. I
               gave the keys to Moss and explained what was going on. Moss
               left the area shortly thereafter. I transported Gates to
               Pullman Holding Facility where he was temporarily held before
               be transferred to Whitman County Jail. Gates has no friends in
               the Pullman area and no ties. Gates came to Pullman with the
               sole intention of parting and has no intention of returning.
               Gates is currently on probation for a felony possession of a

               at approximately 2355 hours I was traveling eastbound on NE
               Campus St approaching Veteran's Way. The defendant's vehicle
               was traveling east in designated bus only lane. The vehicle
               came to a stop in the roadway and unloaded a passenger. The
               vehicle then continued east and changed into the left lane
               without using a turn signal. I activated my emergency lights,
               stopping the vehicle on NE Thatuna St near Linden St. I
               activated my VieVu camera. I contacted the driver and advised
               him of the reason for the stop and that the stop was being
               recorded. I asked for his license, registration, and proof of
               insurance, which he provided. The driver's movements were slow
               and deliberate and it appeared that he had to think about his
               actions before he performed them. The driver was identified by
               WADL as Anthony H. Tran 03/15/97. While waiting for the
               information I could smell the odor of burning marijuana. I
               noticed there was a sandwich bag on the passenger floor board
               which contained what I recognized as marijuana. I shined my
               flashlight on it and the back seat passenger (identified as
               Michael A. Mankowski) looked down and started to move the bag
               with his foot. I asked if anyone in the car was 21 and no one
               was. I asked if anyone had a medical marijuana card and no one
               said they did. I asked Tran how much marijuana was in the car.
               Tran had both of his hands on the steering wheel and was
               staring forward with a "deer in the headlights" look. Tran then
               said he had some on him. I asked Tran where it was and Tran
               checked his pockets and then said he couldn't find it. I asked
               Mankowski about the sandwich bag, which he had now kicked under
               the seat. Mankowski denied any knowledge of a bag and when
               asked to retrieve it he said he was not going to. Mankowski
               provided me his Cougar Card and DOB. I told both passengers
               that they were free to go and they left. I did not identify the
               front passenger. I asked Tran when he last smoked and he said
               about 20 minutes prior. I asked Tran on a scale of 1-10 (with
               10 being the highest) how high he felt. Tran said a 4. I asked
               Tran if he would do some field sobriety tests and he agreed. I
               directed Tran to the sidewalk on the east side of the roadway.
               The sidewalk is paved and level. Lighting was provided by
               overhead lights and my flashlight. The weather was clear with

               an approximate temperature of 45 degrees. Tran was wearing
               jeans, a sweatshirt, and canvas type shoes during the tests.
               The first test I administered was the HGN. I told Tran to stand
               with his feet together and his arms at his sides. I told Tran
               to follow the tip of my pen with his eyes only with out moving
               his head. I held my pen approximately 12-15 inches in front of
               Tran's face and administered the test. I did not see any signs
               of nystagmus during the test. I checked for a lack of
               convergence (inability to cross eyes) and it was present, with
               the right eye converging and the left eye converging slightly
               and then stopping. Tran exhibited body tremors during the test.
               The next test I administered was the walk and turn. I told Tran
               to find an imaginary straight line and put his left foot on the
               line. I told Tran to put his right foot in front of his left
               foot touching heel to toe and leave his arms down at his sides.
               I told Tran to stay in that position while I explained the
               test. I told Tran that when I tell him to begin, to take nine
               steps touching heel to toe, watching his feet as he walked and
               count each step out loud. I told Tran that when he gets to step
               nine, to leave his lead foot in place and using his rear foot,
               take small steps around until facing the way he came. I told
               Tran to take nine steps back touching heel to toe and counting
               each step out loud. I told Tran that once he started, do not
               stop. I reminded Tran to count each step out loud, keep his
               arms at his sides, and watch his feet as he walked. I
               demonstrated the test and asked Tran if he understood and he
               said yes. I told Tran to begin at any time. Starting position:
               Tran stood with his left foot in front of his right foot, which
               is opposite of what I explained and demonstrated. Tran stepped
               out of the starting position with his front foot to regain his
               balance. Tran clarified to take 9 forward steps and then turn
               around. I then told him again to take 9 return steps. First
               Nine Steps: Tran began the test and took slow steps, missing
               heel to toe between steps 1 & 2, 3 & 4, 4 & 5, 6 & 7, and 8 &
               9. Tran performed an improper turn by taking steps with both
               feet and then stumbled to the side. Tran then put his hands in
               his pockets and looked at me. I asked Tran if he was done and
               he said yes. The next test I administered was the one leg
               stand. I told Tran to stand with his feet together and his arms
               at his sides. I told Tran that when I tell him to begin to
               raise the foot of his choice approximately 6 inches off the
               ground. I told Tran to point his toe forward, look at his foot,
               and count out loud by 1000's until I tell him to stop. I asked
               Tran if he understood, and he said yes. I told Tran to begin at
               any time. Tran raised his right foot off the ground and began
               the test. Tran swayed left to right during the test and stopped
               counting out loud at 1009. Tran then put his foot down right
               after he stopped counting. When thirty seconds had elapsed Tran
               still hadn't raised his foot. I asked Tran if he was done and
               he said he did not know how long to count. I asked Tran about
               the marijuana. I asked Tran where the marijuana was in the car
               and he said he would show me. Tran walked over to the passenger
               door and opened it. Tran opened the center console area on the
               dash and removed a bag with a small bud of marijuana. Tran also
               brought out a pipe and prescription bottle. I asked Tran about

               the bag of marijuana under the passenger's seat. Tran looked
               under the passenger's seat and removed a bag which contained
               marijuana. I put the pipe and prescription bottle back into the
               car. I told Tran he was under arrest for Minor Operating a

               Tran and advised him of his right to counsel. I reminded Tran
               he was being audio and video recorded. I searched Tran incident
               to arrest, finding no weapons or items of evidence. I placed
               Tran in the back seat of my patrol car. I legally parked Tran's
               vehicle per his request and locked it. I transported Tran to
               Pullman PD and placed him in a holding cell. I returned to
               WSUPD and applied for and was granted a search warrant for a
               blood draw (see attached). I returned to Pullman PD and brought
               Tran out of his cell. Pullman Fire arrived on scene and I read
               the search warrant to Tran. I watched as Paramedic Jarosch
               opened up the blood draw kit I provided him. I watched as
               Jarosch swabbed the crook of Tran's left arm with iodine. At
               0118 hours Jarosch drew blood into the two vials I provided him
               from Tran's left arm. I provided Tran and Jarosch with a copy
               of the search warrant and property receipt. I fingerprinted and
               photographed Tran and explained that I would be forwarding
               charges. I returned to WSUPD and logged the blood draw kit into
               evidence. I NIK tested the marijuana and it showed a
               presumptive positive result for the presence of Cannabis
               Sativa. I put the marijuana into evidence for destruction.
               Charges to be forwarded pending lab results. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               6th day of September, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3986 09/06/15 SYNOPSIS: Fire in Rogers
               Hall 8th Floor Kitchen & Laundry room. Fire extinguished by
               sprinkler system. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: ***NOTE: REPORT IS NOT FINISHED*** On September 6,
               2015 at about 0114 hours Pullman Fire and WSU Police were
               dispatched to Rogers Hall 8th Floor Kitchen and Laundry room
               for a report of a microwave on fire, flames showing, and the
               room filling with smoke. WSU Police Officers Boyd and Tiengo
               responded to the scene. I was called in to investigate the fire
               at about 0215 hours. I responded to the scene where I was
               briefed on the the fire by Officer Boyd, Firefighter Gollnick,
               and Fire Chief Heston. Officer Boyd and Cpl. Kuhrt assisted me
               with the investigation. Both police and fire initial responders
               said there was water flowing upon their arrival. The door to
               the room was closed. The fire was out when firefighters entered
               the room. The sprinkler head above the sink, across the room
               from the microwave was flowing water. Pullman Fire personnel
               plugged the sprinkler head. The head had already been changed
               out and replaced with a new head prior to my arrival. The used
               head was sitting on the counter in the room. The head is a
               horizontal head rated at 155 degrees Fahrenheit. Firefighter
               Gollnick told me that there were sparks coming from the area of
               the outlet where a microwave and toaster were plugged into.
               Water was spraying onto this area. Both microwave and toaster
               were plugged into the outlet. The room is a combination kitchen
               and laundry room. It has a clothes washer, dryer and a sink on
               the south side of the room. On the north side there is a
               range/oven, a counter with a toaster and two (2) microwaves.
               The microwaves were position on top of a wood shelf mounted
               above the counter. The counter was made of wood and topped with
               a typical Formica finishing layer. There are no other
               appliances in the room. There are florescent lights in the
               room. The light cover on the fixture located above the fire
               area was warped from the heat of the fire. The lights were all
               on and usable. The ceiling in the room is covered with a
               fibrous ceiling tile. The tiles are adhesively fastened to the
               ceiling. In the area where the fire occurred several of the
               tiles fell to the ground or onto the counter. They were soaked
               and saturated with water from the sprinkler. I could see a
               noticeable line of demarcation going around the room. The line
               was at the height of the sprinkler heads, about six inches down
               from the ceiling. The area above the line was darker black/gray
               soot color. The origin of the fire is on the north side of the

               room where the microwaves are located. More specifically it
               would be on the northwest corner of the microwave counter. The
               microwave on the west side of the room was destroyed. It had
               the plastic on the front melted. The protective plastic cover
               on the door was gone. The key pad had burnt up. I could not
               make out the make and model of the microwave. I could see what
               appeared to be aluminum foil inside the microwave. There was a
               black burned mass of what appeared to be melted plastic lying
               on the lower counter top below the microwave. I had to break
               away the melted plastic and pry the microwave door open. Inside
               I found aluminum foil that had been folded into a pan. It was
               rectangular and had lips on the edges. When I opened the door I
               could smell chicken. There was no actual chicken found inside
               the microwave. I also found a burnt piece of material that was
               fibrous. It looked like the absorbent pad that is placed under
               fresh cuts of meat found in store packaging. There was blacked
               char on the piece of aluminum foil. On the lower countertop,
               west side, there was a toaster. The toaster was melted and
               destroyed. No food was found inside the toaster. I identified
               the toaster as: MAKE: WALMART MODEL: 16041 MODEL: Rival 2 Slice
               Toaster 120V/60Hz/750 Watts The melted plastic from the
               microwave above the toaster had dripped down onto the counter
               near the toaster. The burning molten plastic caught the front
               of the plastic coated toaster on fire. The fire on the counter
               top caught the wood shelving unit on fire. The fire traveled up
               the non Formica covered vertical wood piece. It also traveled
               horizontally across the bottom of the shelf towards the east
               end. There are holes at each end of the wood shelf where the
               microwave cords went though. The microwaves were plugged into
               outlets located at each end of the counter. I identified the
               microwave on the east side of the counter as: MAKE: AMAMA
               MODEL: RADARANGE MODEL: AMC4080AAB SN: 14818360PJ WSU #:
               *********** The east microwave appeared to be the same size as
               the one on the west. It is probable that they are similar makes
               and model if not the same. There was black soot on and around
               the cord where it entered the microwave. This looks to be from
               where the smoke and heat traveled up through the cord hold in
               the upper shelf. The east microwave did not catch fire.
               Aluminum foil inside a running microwave can cause sparks and
               fire. It is unknown who was using the microwave. The microwave
               appears to have been left unattended while it was in use. It is
               unknown if this was an accidental cooking fire or if it was
               intentional. The cause of the fire is undetermined. Digital
               photos were taken. The case remains under investigation. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this ____ day of _____________, 2015, in

               approximately 0123 hours I was dispatched to Malicious Mischief
               case at Dana Hall. Upon arrival I contacted a Facilities
               employee who stated he had found a broken window on the
               southern side of the building. The employee walked me to an
               exterior door that had a window in it. There was a large hole
               in the glass. As I neared the door I noticed that the window
               had Plexiglass instead of traditional glass. Just inside the
               door was a large rock just a bit smaller than a football. It
               was clear that someone had thrown the rock through the window.
               I took photos of the damage and told the employee he could
               board up the window. The damage to the Plexiglass is estimated
               at $30 dollars. The photos of the damage were uploaded to the
               files folder. END OF REPORT I certify and declare under penalty

               NARRATIVE: On 09-06-15 at approximately 0232 hours I was
               dispatched to the reported of an intoxicated male outside the
               President's Residence, located at 755 NE Campus St. Dispatch
               advised the complainant, Tyrell R. Warren-Burnett (DOB 08-31-
               84), was reporting a male had been outside near the President's
               Residence Cottage for the past hour and appeared to be
               intoxicated. Dispatch also mentioned the male had been howling
               like a wolf at nothing in particular. Ofc. Westerman and I
               responded to the area. Warren-Burnett was on scene and told me
               he lives in the President's Residence Cottage. He pointed at a
               male standing over in the bushes and trees by the fence, and
               said he had been standing there for over an hour. He also said
               the male had been howling like a wolf. Ofc. Westerman and I
               walked over to the area where the male was standing. I asked
               the male if he would turn around and talk with me, and he
               finally did. I asked him if he was okay, and he said yes. I
               asked the male how much he had to drink tonight, and he told me
               a little bit. I asked the male if he had his driver's license
               on him and he pulled out his wallet and handed me his driver's
               license. He was identified as Benjamin M. Hartmann (DOB 06-02-
               91) by his WA driver's license. I asked Hartmann where he was,
               and he responded Tonasket. I asked him multiple times what city
               is he currently in, and Hartmann finally responded Tonasket
               again. I advised Hartmann he was being audio and video
               recorded. I asked Hartmann where he lives in Pullman, and he
               said "oh just right here". I asked him how long he has been
               standing outside here, and he said a couple days. Hartmann
               mentioned he was just doing his job standing outside. I asked
               him what his job here was, and he responded to "protect and
               serve". I asked him if he had been making howling noises, and
               he responded "no that's not my jurisdiction". I asked Hartmann
               if he was willing to take a voluntary PBT, and he said yes. He
               provided a breath sample of .214. When we asked him what he was
               studying, he said Forestry. Westerman asked Hartmann what time
               it was, and instead of answering he began to look at his watch.
               I tried asking Hartmann if he had roommates, and he told me

               yeah. I asked if he would be able to call one of them to see if
               they would be able to care for him. As he was reaching into his
               right pocket he pulled out a pocketknife that was clipped on
               his pocket. Ofc. Westerman and I drew our firearms, and I told
               Hartmann to drop the knife. He dropped the pocketknife, and
               Westerman took Hartmann to the ground. I handcuffed Hartmann in
               the prone position (double locked), and advised him he was not
               under arrest and just being detained. I read him his
               constitutional rights from my department issued Miranda Warning
               card. He invoked his rights. I advised him I was taking him
               into protective custody. I searched him without further
               incident, and placed him into the back of my patrol vehicle. I
               transported him to Pullman Regional Hospital and turned him
               over to medical staff. I cleared the scene. No further action.
               My Vievu camera was activated, and the video was later
               downloaded into the permanent digital evidence folder. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
