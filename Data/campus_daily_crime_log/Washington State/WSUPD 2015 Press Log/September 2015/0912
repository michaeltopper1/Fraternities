    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Boyd/335 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W4124 SYNOPSIS: Water leak in the CUB
               originating in the Subway food prep area and running through
               the floor into the Bookie below. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 09/12/15 at about 0828 hrs
               Dispatch advised of a reported utility problem in the CUB. The
               report was of a water leak from an unknown source that was
               flooding the Bookie. Officer Kirshner and I responded. We were
               directed by staff at the Bookie to an area that had a large
               amount of water on the floor and water actively leaking through
               the ceiling. We went to the area above the leak and found a
               burst water line in the food prep area of Subway in the food
               court. We were able to shut off the water supply to the water
               line and stop the leak. CUB custodians began cleaning up the
               water in Subway and the Bookie. I contacted the responsible for
               the Bookie, Lioubov M. Baugh (112953), the responsible for
               Subway, Nathaniel F. Tiegs (042383), and the responsible for
               the CUB Karee A. Shaw (052777). I explained to them what
               happened and provided them with my business card and the case
               number. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 12 day of September,
               2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               hall for a highly intoxicated person. Roommate was willing to
               care for the subject and he was allowed to remain in his room.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Christopher J. Keen
               (091896) Warned Intoxication 2. NARRATIVE: On 091215 at
               approximately 2259 hours, I was dispatched to a report of a
               highly intoxicated person in room 231. Upon arrival, I knocked
               on the door and could hear someone yelling inside the room. I
               knocked again and announced our presence. A male later
               identified as Christopher J. Keen answered the door. His eyes
               were bloodshot and watery, he smelled heavily of alcohol, and
               he had two abrasions on his forehead indicating he had fallen.
               I asked Keen if we could come in and talk to him and he told we
               could. I explained to Keen that I was not there to give him an
               MIP, but that I would like a PBT reading for the medics when
               they arrive. Keen was reluctant, but provided a sample which
               showed a reading of .187 on my Alco Sensor FST PBT. I asked
               Keen several knowledge questions and he was able to answer most
               of them correctly. Pullman Fire Department arrived and
               questioned him. He stated he didn't want to go to the hospital.
               PFD was able to get in touch with Keen's roommate who stated he
               would take care of Keen for the night. A few minutes later,
               Matthew C. Childers arrived and stated he would care for Keen.
               I asked him if he lived in 231 and he told me he did. I
               explained that he shouldn't let Keen sleep on his back and to
               provide him with as much water as he is willing to drink.
               Childers thanked us and we cleared. Nothing further. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.

               Lexa's father Leland A. Howell 12/29/67 had called concerned
               about his daughter Lexa. Leland stated that he had called Lexa
               around 1700 hours and she still had not returned his call by
               2345 hours. Leland told dispatch that it is out of the ordinary
               for Lexa not to return his call. Leland was requesting and
               Officer to check on the welfare of Lexa. I called Lexa but her
               cell phone went straight to voicemail. I left a message on
               Lexa's cell phone and responded to her dorm room at Global

               left my business card on the door asking for Lexa to return my
               call. As I got back to the station, dispatch stated Leland had
               called back and provided two names of Lexa's friends who also
               live in Global Scholars Hall. I called Brianna Mackenzie Wright
               07/02/97. Wright stated she last saw Lexa last night and knew
               Lexa was at a date dash tonight. I asked Wright if she was
               willing to send a text to Lexa asking her to call her Dad back.
               Wright said she would. I called Leland back and updated him
               with what I found out. Leland seemed to be satisfied with the
               information and the case was closed. END OF REPORT I certify

               possession of marijuana. Charges pending lab results. Charges

               Porter/042797 Forward Cgs Poss. Marijuana NARRATIVE: On
               September 13, 2015 at about 0125 hrs I was driving southbound
               on Stadium Way near College Ave. when I noticed a vehicle that
               was following me southbound on Stadium Way. The vehicle caught
               my attention because the vehicle's headlights were extremely
               dim and it appeared they only had their parking lights on, not
               their headlights. I stopped and waited for the vehicle to pass.
               I pulled out behind the vehicle, ID K549937, and initiated a
               traffic stop, turning on my overhead lights. The vehicle
               stopped on East Main St. near Sellas restaurant. I contacted
               the driver of the vehicle, Georgia A. Hammond (070896), and
               told her the reason for the stop and the stop was being
               recorded. As I was speaking with Hammond I could see a vapor in
               the vehicle, which was pouring out the open windows. The rear
               passenger, Tyler A. Barker (050195), had a hand held vaporizer
               in his hand. Based on my training and experience I know the
               type of vaporizer held by Barker is commonly used to smoke
               tobacco as well as marijuana. As I spoke with Hammond I could
               smell the odor of burnt marijuana emitting from the vehicle. I
               asked for her driver's license, vehicle registration, and proof
               of insurance. She provided the requested information. I noticed
               her driver's license indicated she was under 21 years old. I
               asked Hammond if I could check her eyes and she agreed. I had
               her sit sideways in her seat and administered a horizontal gaze
               nystagmus test. I observed she had bloodshot and watery eyes
               with dilated pupils. I had her open her mouth and noticed she
               had a thin green film covering her tongue. I know based on my
               training and experience that this green film is a sign of
               ingesting marijuana. I had Hammond exit the vehicle and asked
               when the last time she smoked marijuana was. She said the
               previous day. I asked about the green film on her tongue and
               she said she just had a dry mouth. I asked if she would perform
               some field sobriety tests so I could make sure she was not
               impaired by marijuana and she agreed. I told her I would be
               evaluating her based on how well she performed on the test as
               well as how well she followed my instructions. The first test I

               administered was the horizontal gaze nystatgmus test. I told
               Hammond to stand with her feet together and her arms at her
               sides. I told her to follow the tip of my pen with her eyes
               only and not to move her head. Hammond said she understood. I
               had Hammond remove her glasses and confirmed she could see my
               pen ok without her glasses on. I held my pen approximately 12-
               15 inches from Hammond's face, slightly above eye level. I
               confirmed she had equal pupil size and her eyes tracked
               equally. I observed Hammond had bloodshot and watery eyes, a
               rebound dilation in both eyes, and a lack of convergence in her
               left eye. I began to explain the nine step walk and turn to
               Hammond and she told me she could not perform the test because
               she has really bad balance from a car accident as a child. She
               also said she would not be able to perform the one leg stand. I
               skipped to the Romberg balance test. I told Hammond to stand
               with her feet together and her arms at her sides. I told her
               when instructed to do so to close her eyes, tilt her head back,
               and estimate the passage of 30 seconds. I told her once she
               believed 30 seconds had passed to bring her head forward, open
               her eyes, and say stop. I had Hammond begin the test. During
               the test I observed Hammond had eyelid tremors and her carotid
               artery was visibly pulsing in her neck. Hammond estimated the
               passage of 30 seconds in 27 seconds. I told Hammond I believed
               she was lying to me and had been smoking marijuana. She then
               admitted she smoked marijuana a couple hours prior to the stop.
               I asked on a scale of 1-10 how high she thought she was. She
               said a 6. I advised Hammond she was under arrest for minor
               operating a motor vehicle after consuming marijuana. I placed
               her in handcuffs (double locked) and advised her of her right
               to remain silent and her right to an attorney. At about this
               time Officer Stewart was collecting marijuana from several of
               her passengers who he was speaking to and voluntarily turned
               over their marijuana. Hammond heard this and told me she too
               had marijuana and it was in her right front shorts pocket. I
               searched Hammond incident to arrest and located a small bag
               containing a bit of marijuana. I placed Hammond in the back of
               my patrol car and read her Constitutional Rights from a pre-
               printed card. She said she understood her rights and verbally
               waived them. I asked Hammond if she would allow me to search
               her vehicle and she said no. Officer Stewart provided me with a
               large plastic canister containing ______ grams of fresh
               marijauna and a sunglasses case containing a glass pipe and
               ____ grams of marijuana. He told me the large canister belonged
               to Barker and the sunglasses case belonged to Camille C. Porter
               (042797). Barker was in the rear seat directly behind the
               driver and Porter was in the rear seat behind the passenger.
               Officer Stewart said he just went up to the car and asked if
               they had marijuana and if they would give it to him. Both
               subjects complied and provided their marijuana voluntarily. I
               went to the vehicle and spoke to Porter and Barker. I explained
               I would be forwarding charges for possession of marijuana on
               both of them to the Whitman County Prosecutor's Office because
               they were both under 21. Hammond gave permission for the
               vehicle to be moved by an officer so it was in a legal parking
               spot. The vehicle was moved and secured. I obtained Hammond's

               purse and cell phone from the vehicle at her request. I
               transported Hammond to the Pullman Police Department holding
               facility where I read her the implied consent warning for
               breath so she would be aware of the sanctions regarding driving
               under the influence and after consuming marijuana. Hammond
               signed stating it was read to her. I advised Hammond I would be
               applying for a search warrant for her blood and asked if she
               would submit to a PBT test so I could confirm she had not
               consumed alcohol. She agreed and provided a sample of .000 on
               Alco-Sensor FST 5493. I placed Hammond in a holding cell and
               returned to the WSU Police Department where I applied for, and
               was granted, search warrant #SW091315A for Hammonds blood. The
               conversation with Judge Robinson was recorded and has been
               downloaded to the case file. I returned to the Pullman Police
               Department and called for Pullman Ambulance Personnel to
               respond and perform the blood draw. Upon their arrival I read
               the search warrant to Hammond and the Fire Personnel performing
               the blood draw, Joseph Branson. I watched as Branson swabbed
               the crook of Hammond's right arm with iodine. I watched as he
               drew blood from Hammond's arm into the two grey topped vials
               that I provided to him. I took possession of the vials and
               labeled them before entering them into evidence. I provided
               Hammond and Branson with a copy of the search warrant and
               receipt for property taken. I explained to Hammond I would be
               forwarding charges to the prosecutors office for possession of
               marijuana and minor operating a motor vehicle after consuming
               marijuana, pending the results of the lab blood test. Hammond
               was released. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 13 day of

               ripped down an emergency exit sign on the 3rd floor of Global

               Turner 11/13/96 Malicious Mischief 2. NARRATIVE: On 09/13/15 at
               approximately 0227 hours I was dispatched to a Malicious
               Mischief case at Global Scholars Hall 3rd floor. Upon arrival I
               met with an RA who stated someone had ripped an emergency exit
               sign off the ceiling. The RA stated there was a witness on the
               third floor. I contacted Tyler Charles Haldane 01/15/97 who
               stated that he was in his room when he heard a loud bang.
               Haldane did not go into the hallway to find out what the noise
               was. A while later Haldane went into the hallway and saw that
               part of the emergency exit sign that hangs from the ceiling was
               on the ground. Haldane assumed the noise was the emergency sign
               being broken. Haldane went back to his room and then around
               0215 hours he heard a loud noise again. Believing someone was
               breaking the emergency sign again he went into the hallway. He
               saw a male running down the hallway past his room. Haldane
               followed the male to room 303. As the male tried to get into
               his room Haldane confronted the male asking why he broke the
               sign. The male responded with, "I don't know what you were
               talking about" and quickly went into his room. Haldane
               contacted the RA on duty who called dispatch. The RA on duty
               went to room 303 and knocked on the door. The RAs could see the
               lights on in the room and could hear someone inside however the
               person would not answer the door. I also went to room 303 and
               knocked for several minutes without anybody answering. With the
               assistance of the RA's we looked up who lives in room 303.
               Jason Wayne Turner 11/13/96 is the only occupant registered to
               room 303. I looked up Turner in the WSU directory and called
               his cell phone. Turner did not answer and I left a message
               asking him to return my call. The damage to the emergency exit
               was documented and photographed. I will have a Dayshift Officer
               attempt contact with Turner. END OF NARRATIVE I certify and

               door. One pack of breaded chicken patties was stolen. A screen
               door was also damaged. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               2. NARRATIVE: On 09/13/15 at approximately 0327 hours I was
               assisting Ofc. Tiengo with a Malicious Mischief case in front
               of the D building of Chief Joseph when Derek James Williamson
               03/22/96 and Brian Zackary Keniston 05/24/96 walked up to me
               and stated that their apartment had just been broken into. I
               walked over to their apartment, D8, and they invited me inside.
               Keniston and Williamson stated they had been asleep when
               someone had entered into their apartment through an unlocked
               slider door on the rear of their apartment. Keniston stated
               that they were woken up by a loud crashing noise. Keniston said
               two other people were awake in the apartment when this
               occurred. I spoke with Jared M.J. Nichols 09/19/95 and Bryan
               Davis Lapierre 07/30/96 who stated they were playing video
               games in Nichols room. Lapierre stated that at approxiamtely
               0310 hours they heard someone out in the living room but they
               had assumed it was Williamson. Lapierre and Nichols continued
               to play video games until they heard the loud crashing noise.
               Lapierre stated that they came out into the living room and
               found the slider open and the fridge open as well. The
               roommates found an approximate 8 foot long 2X4 board against
               their slider door. They believed the 2X4 hitting slider door
               was the cause of the loud bang noise. The roommates stated it
               was clear that someone had thrown the board at the slider. I
               asked the roommates if anything was missing. Williamson said
               the only thing missing was a pack of breaded chicken patties
               taken from the fridge. Everybody said nothing else seemed to be
               disturbed. The roommates did not see anybody but thought the
               suspect was male because they hear a males voices. The screen
               door on the slider had two rips in it from the board hitting
               it. I provided the roommates with my business card and their
               case number. I advised the roommates to keep their doors
               locked. Photos of the damage to the screen door were taken. The
               damage is valued at $30 dollars. The stolen chicken patties is
               valued at $10 dollars. Pending further investigative leads this
               case can be closed out as inactive. END OF REPORT I certify and

               Joseph Apartments for a case where someone had thrown a rock
               through the window of a car. At the same time as that call I

               open door and could see into the apartment from standing
               outside. I noticed the fridge and freezer doors were wide open.
               Ofc. Tiengo responded to my location and I yelled loudly
               identifying ourselves as Police Officers. There was no
               response. After calling into the residence several more times,
               we made entry. Once inside unit E15 we found nobody inside. It
               appeared as if someone had entered through the slider door and
               rummaged through the fridge and freezer. Ofc. Tiengo and I
               closed and locked the slider door and locked the front door
               that was also unlocked. After securing the apartment I left my
               business card on the door requesting the occupants to call me
               about a potential break in. At approximately 0400 hours Ofc.
               Boyd radioed that the occupant of E15 had just arrived home. I
               walked back to E15 and contacted Yajaira Rivera 09/20/94.
               Rivera stated she had cooked eggs earlier in the night and her
               roommate, Karinna Mendoza 11/03/95, hates the smell of eggs.
               Rivera opened the slider to ventilate the apartment. Rivera
               stated that she went out for the night and purposefully left
               the slider door cracked open. I told Rivera how I had found her
               apartment and asked her to look around to see if anything was
               taken. Rivera looked around her apartment and said it did not
               appear as anything was taken. I provided Rivera with my
               business card and her case number. I asked Rivera to contact me
               if she or Mendoza noticed anything missing over the next few
               days. There was no damage to unit E15 since the suspect entered
               the open slider door. END OF REPORT I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 14th day of
               September, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: BRW/325 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W4154 SYNOPSIS: Exterior window of the E
               building recreation room broken out. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 09/13/15 at approximately 0330
               hours I had been in the area of the Chief Joseph Apartments for
               a case where someone had thrown a rock through the window of a
               car. At the same time as that call I was approached by two
               residences of Chief Joseph who reported their apartment being
               broken into. Due to the two calls I decided to walk around the
               complex looking for other signs of break ins. I came across the
               recreation room for the E building of Chief Joseph. The
               recreation room does not have an room number or any other
               identifying designations. The recreation room is located on the
               southwest corner ground floor of the E building. I found a
               large window that faces south that had been broken out. I
               determined that someone had taken a candle stick road cone and
               thrown it through the window. The road cone is about four feet
               tall with a heavy rubber base. The cone was now in the center
               of the recreation room with shattered class strewn about. It
               did not appear anybody made entry into the room. I photographed
               the damage and called Facilities. Once Facilities arrived on
               scene I showed them the broken window. The damage to the window
               is estimated at $150 dollars. The broken window appears to be
               in connection with several break ins at Chief Joseph. All
               related cases have been attached to case number 15-W4150. END
               OF REPORT I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 14th day of September, 2015, in
               Pullman, Washington. _______________________________________
