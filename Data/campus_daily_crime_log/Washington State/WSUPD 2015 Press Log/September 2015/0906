               subjects were contacted and voluntarily destroyed their
               marijuana and drug paraphernalia. forward to student conduct.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. David E. Rodriguez-
               Morales (013196) Warned Possession of Marijuana 2. Vaughn M.
               Riley (020296) Warned Possession of marijuana. NARRATIVE: On
               090615 at approximately 1919 hours, I was dispatched to contact
               Jena Doolittle in Rogers Hall near room 235 regarding the odor
               of burning marijuana. Upon arrival, I contacted Doolittle who
               told me she was called by the RA on duty for Rogers Hall and
               smelled the odor of burning marijuana coming from room 235. I
               went to room 235 and smelled the odor of marijuana coming from
               the room. I knocked on the door and Vaughn M. Riley answered
               it. I asked all occupants of the room to come into the hallway
               and Riley and David Rodriguez-Morales walked in to the hallway.
               I asked them if they knew why I was there. They both told me it
               was because they were smoking in their room. I told them they
               were right. I asked if either of them had a medical marijuana
               card and they both told me they didn't. I asked if either of
               them was 21 and they both told me they were not. I asked each
               of them how much they smoked. Riley told me he smoked a bowl
               and David said he smoked a bowl also. I explained there were
               two options in how to handle the situation. I explained they
               could get all the illegal items in their room, destroy them and
               get sent to WSU Student Conduct. Option two was that I would
               seize their room, apply for a search warrant that may or may
               not be granted. If it was granted, I would search their room,
               seize any illegal items and charge them with any criminal
               violations along with sending them to WSU Student Conduct. Both
               Riley and David chose option one. They entered their room,
               grabbed a pipe with marijuana in the bowl, a metal grinder, a
               plastic box that contained marijuana and a plastic bag with
               approximately two grams of marijuana in it. I escorted them to
               the dumpster area of Rogers Hall where they destroyed their
               pipe, grinder, plastic box and ground the marijuana in the
               dirt. I explained the conduct process to them and released them
               from the contact. Forward to WSU Student Conduct. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               dispatched to a breathing problem in Rogers Hall. Female was
               having a panic attack because she thought her boyfriend was
               going to break up with her for cheating on him. She calmed down
               and both parties agreed to hash out their issues civilly.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 090615
               at approximately 2357 hours, Pullman Fire Department responded
               to Rogers Hall regarding a breathing problem. I responded and
               dispatch advised there was a female, later identified as
               Justina M. Messmore-Estrada, was having a panic attack
               following an argument she had with her boyfriend. I contacted
               Justina and Ofc. Boyd contacted Julian D. Hill (073197).
               Justina told me that they were arguing because she was cheating
               on him and he found out. She stated Hill was going to break up
               with her. She told me she began crying so hard that she had a
               panic attack and couldn't breathe. I asked her if the argument
               was physical and she told me it wasn't. Ofc. Boyd told me that
               Hill's account was very similar to Justina's account. He told
               Boyd that he tried to leave and Justina sat in front of the
               door preventing him from leaving. Hill told Boyd that he didn't
               want charges filed against Justina for preventing him from
               leaving. Medics responded and checked out Justina and
               determined she was okay. I asked Justina and Hill if they were
               going to continue arguing if we left and both assured me that
               they weren't. I explained that we didn't want anyone to get
               hurt or have any further medical issues and they both assured
               me we wouldn't be dealing with them any further. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 7th day of September, 2015, in Pullman,

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3999 SYNOPSIS: Subject processed, cited
               and released for DUI. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR#
               1.Julia B. Farnham 10/26/95 Cite/Release DUI C09962 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 09/07/15 at approximately 0140 hours Intern Said
               and I were traveling northeast on NE N. Fairway near Beasley.
               The defendant's vehicle was traveling southwest towards my
               vehicle. I activated the radar (veh 38) and it displayed a
               speed reading of 28MPH in a 20MPH speed zone. I turned around
               and got behind the defendant. The defendant turned right onto
               NE Stadium Way and when it did, it turned into the lane
               furthest from the curb. As the vehicle turned left onto NE
               Cougar Way I activated my emergency lights, stopping the
               vehicle near Streit Hall. I activated my VieVu camera and
               exited my vehicle. I contacted the driver and notified her of
               the reasons for the stop and that I was recording. I asked for
               her license, registration, and proof of insurance. The driver
               was verbally identified as Julia B. Farnham 10/26/95. Farnham
               could not provide me with current registration, but gave me her
               insurance. While standing at the vehicle I could smell the odor
               of intoxicants emitting from the vehicle. I asked Farnham how
               much she had to drink and she said not much. I asked Farnham
               how much that was. Farnham said 3 drinks about 2 hours prior. I
               asked Farnham if I could check her eyes and she agreed. I
               administered an HGN test with Farnham seated in the vehicle. I
               saw a lack of smooth pursuit and a distinct and sustained
               nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes. I noticed her eyes
               were blood shot and watery. I returned to my patrol car and ran
               Farnham through Whitcom. Whitcom radioed that she was clear and
               current. I turned off my front facing emergency lights. Ofc.
               Boyd and Intern Cole arrived on scene around this time. I
               returned to Farnham and asked if she would perform some field
               sobriety tests. Farnham declined. I asked Farnham to exit the
               vehicle, which she did. I told Farnham she was under arrest for
               Minor Operating a Motor Vehicle After Consuming Alcohol. I
               handcuffed (D/L) Farnham and advised her of her right to
               counsel and that the contact was being recorded. I placed
               Farnham in the back seat of my patrol car. Intern Cole legally
               parked Farnham's vehicle per her request. I transported Farnham
               to Pullman PD for the BAC. Upon arrival I checked the Draeger
               and found it working properly with the mouth tube warm to the
               touch. I read Farnham her Constitutional Rights at 0204 hours.
               Farnham said she understood her rights and signed both
               signature blocks. I checked Farnham's mouth at 0205 hours,

               finding no foreign substance. I read Farnham her Implied
               Consent Warnings at 0207 hours. Farnham signed that it was read
               to her. I asked Farnham if she would provide a breath sample.
               Farnham checked the "yes" box and initialed next to it. I asked
               Farnham if she understood the warnings and she said yes.
               Farnham provided a breath sample of .160 (IR) / .159 (EC) at
               0226 hours and a sample of .154 (IR) / .150 (EC) at 0230 hours.
               The breath test was administered in accordance to the methods
               approved by the Washington State Toxicologist pursuant to the
               Washington Administrative Code. I provided Farnham with a copy
               of the following documents: Driver's Hearing Request, Notice of
               Hearing & Conditions of Release, and the breath test document.
               I issued Farnham a criminal citation for DUI. I explained the
               citation to her and provided her a copy. I released Farnham
               from custody and provided her with a courtesy transport home.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 7th day of September, 2015, in
               Pullman, Washington. _______________________________________

               hrs Dispatch advised hall staff at Stephenson East were
               requesting officer assistance with a group of students who had
               been drinking in a room and were being uncooperative. I
               responded and upon my arrival met one of the hall staff members
               escorting a male outside with numerous empty beer cans/bottles.
               I waited for them to dispose of the cans/bottles and went back
               to the 11th floor with them. Once at room 1121 hall staff told
               me they were walking by on rounds and heard a lot of noise,
               including bottle clanking, coming from inside room 1121. They
               attempted to contact the occupants, who initially refused to
               open the door. Hall staff said it sounded like people were
               putting things away or hiding things in the room. Once hall
               staff began calling police the subjects became much more
               cooperative and turned over all of the empty alcohol containers
               they had. They claimed not to have any more alcohol. I spoke to
               the subjects, who were identified as Richard R. Luehrs Jr,

               M. Bryan, Colin L. Coker, Abraham J. Podkranic, Trey D. Handy,
               and Brittany N. Kesic. I gave them all a warning about drinking
               in the dorms and MIP in general. I told them I would be sending
               the incident to student conduct only and that this was their
               only warning. I provided them with the opportunity to turn over
               any remaining alcohol or other illegal substances. They said
               they did not have anything and I cleared. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 07 day of September, 2015, in Pullman,
