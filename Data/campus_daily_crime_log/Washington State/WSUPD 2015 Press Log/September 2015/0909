    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: JAK/333 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W4043 SYNOPSIS: WSU Parking Services
               requested an Officer respond to the Steptoe Village Apartments
               parking lot for a Wheel Lock. A patron reported a parking
               permit as lost and the permit was being displayed in a vehicle.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 09-09-
               15, I responded to the Steptoe Village Apartments parking lot
               and met with WSU Parking Services employee, Antonio Barragan
               (09-20-91). Barragan said the driver of WA/ABT3580 reported his
               WSU issued parking permit (Steptoe STP 5038) as lost. The
               driver of the vehicle was identified as Jiehong Qiu (08-20-88).
               Barragan said WSU Parking Services issued another parking
               permit (Steptoe STP 5064) to Qiu as a replacement for the
               Permit he said was lost. WSU Parking Services placed a wheel
               lock on WA/ABT3580. I was able to determine Qiu lives in
               Steptoe Village, apartment S-104. I contacted Qiu at his
               apartment and asked if I could speak with him. I explained WSU
               Parking Services placed a wheel lock on his vehicle
               WA/ABT3580)because it was displaying a parking permit he had
               listed as lost. Qiu explained he requested another parking
               permit from WSU Parking Services because his car (WA/ABT3580)
               had been in the shop. He said his friend allowed him to borrow
               a car (WA/AJV9232) while his was in the shop. Qiu placed the
               new parking permit (Steptoe STP 5064) in his friend's car while
               his was in the shop. Qiu said he had just received his car back
               from the shop and had not returned the borrowed car to his
               friend yet. I explained to Qiu he had to go to WSU Parking
               Services to rectify the situation. I asked him if he would give
               me both parking permits (Steptoe STP 5038 and Steptoe STP 5064.
               I took possession of the permits and took photos of them. I
               cleared and returned to the WSU Police Department. I downloaded
               the photographs to the "Files" section of the report. WSU
               Parking Services said Qiu paid all of his fines on 09-09-15. I
               took the parking permits back to WSU Parking Services. No
               Criminal charges are being forwarded or requested as Qiu
               settled all debts with WSU Parking Services. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 9th day of September, 2015, in Pullman,

               1. 2. NARRATIVE: Sarah Hluboky reported she had been struck
               while in the cross walk on Stadium Way at the exit of the Smith
               Center parking area. Sarah said she had just got out of class
               at the "Q" and was walking across Stadium Way, between 1400 and
               1420 hours, when she was struck in the left leg by a vehicle
               turning out of the Smith Center parking area and right on to
               Stadium Way. Sarah said when struck she did not fall down, but
               was knocked off balance. After being hit by the vehicle Sarah
               said the vehicle kept inching by her and then just drove off.
               Sarah said she was kind a in shock and she wasn't able to get a
               license plate number. She said she believed there was an "A"
               and "E" in the plate number. Sarah described the car as a
               silver to light gold Subaru Hatchback, maybe longer as in a
               Station Wagon. Sarah described the driver as a pale white
               female with brown long hair wearing sunglasses. After the
               incident Sarah said her leg did not bother her much so she
               continued to walk home. Once home her leg was hurting more so
               she decided she had better report the situation. Sarah was
               encouraged to get her leg checked out if she believed she
               needed too. Sarah also believed a traffic camera may have
               captured the situation. Sarah was informed there are not any
               camera that view the intersection in question, or further down
               the road in the direction the vehicle was traveling. Sarah was
               asked to give us a call if she happens to see the vehicle
               again. No further at this time. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,

               dispatched to the report of 2 males smoking marijuana behind
               the dumpster of Stephenson South. I responded to the area and
               was met by RED Dustin Cooper. He pointed to two males walking
               by Rogers Hall and said that they were the two people his staff
               had seen smoking. I walked up to them and asked to speak with
               them as they had started talking to two other males. They
               agreed to speak with me. Both Alejandro F. Guizar (050497) and
               Jacob E. Deruwe (092096) appeared very nervous. I asked to see
               their tongues and they both had a milky film on it that is
               indicative of having recently smoked marijuana. I informed them
               hall staff had seen them smoking and they displayed a defeated
               posture. They confirmed they were under 21 and did not have
               medicinal marijuana cards. I told them to turn over anything
               they should not have. Deruwe had a large glass bong they had
               smoked out of. I informed him he was not allowed to keep it in
               the residence halls but I was not going to seize it or have him
               destroy it. Guizar produce a small pill container containing
               marijuana. I had him dispose of it. They were free to go after
               I told them I would refer them to Student Conduct. I cleared.

               090915 at approximately 1718 hours we were dispatched to a
               stolen car. Levi M. Daniels (061395) reported that he had
               parked his car (WA/ASV8981) somewhere near Olympia Ave and
               Nevada St at 0130 hours. We searched the area and could not
               find it. I then retrieved Daniels and had him show me where it
               may have been. We completed the stolen vehicle form and
               submitted it to Whitcom. When graveyard came in I informed them
               of the missing vehicle. Ofc. Whitman then located it in the
               Grey 2 lot of Stephenson. This lot had been checked, however,
               we had contacted a large disabled vehicle directly in front of
               the missing vehicle. The disabled vehicle had completely
               obstructed the view of the other vehicle. Daniels responded to
               the lot and confirmed his vehicle had not been stolen and there
               was no damage. I had Whitcom clear the vehicle and I cleared.

               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: Sinea Moss
               reported damage to the metal trim of the community laundry room
               door. Moss was not sure if it was intentional or not. The 3 to
               4 inch tear in the trim is about 4 to 5 inches below the latch
               of the door. The metal trim was also bent outward right at
               latch level. It appeared the latch of the door would catch the
               metal when the door was opened. It is very possible the tear
               was caused by the latch catching on the metal trim. There is no
               damage around the latch itself as if someone was attempting to
               break into the laundry room. It is not believed the damage to
               the trim was malicious. My findings were explained to Moss.
               Moss said she would contact Housing services to repair the trim
               and make it so the latch does not catch the trim when the door
               is opened. No further at this time. I certify and declare under

               hours I was dispatched to the report of an assault on Cougar
               Way near Stadium Way. Dispatch advised the complainant, Izak O.
               Kam (DOB 08-02-95), said someone threw a handful of gravel from
               a moving vehicle at his girlfriend about 10 minutes ago. I
               called Kam on the telephone. I asked if I could speak with his
               girlfriend, and he said yes. His girlfriend identified herself
               as Kiera M. McMenimen (DOB 08-01-95). I asked if she needed any
               medical attention, and she said no. McMenimen told me she was
               walking home from the Student Recreation Center and crossed the
               intersection of Stadium Way and Cougar Way. She said she was on
               the sidewalk next to Mooberry Track and near Streit Hall when a
               newer white, Ford Fusion (2014-2016 year range) drove by her.
               She said both the driver side and passenger side window was
               rolled down. She said the male in the front passenger seat
               threw a handful of gravel at her, and it hit her in her chest.
               She said she could hear both males laughing, but they did not
               say anything. She said the vehicle made a left hand turn onto
               Stadium Way. I asked if she could give me a better description
               of the vehicle, as far as decals or distinguishing marks, and
               she said no. She was unable to provide a partial license plate
               number or the state the vehicle was out of. I asked if she
               could describe the male who threw the gravel at her, and she
               said no. She was only able to tell me she was certain it was a
               male. I asked her on a scale of 1-10 how much pain did it cause
               her and she said it was about a 4. McMenimen mentioned she was
               more shocked than anything, and this is the only time she has
               felt unsafe in Pullman. She also mentioned the gravel did not
               leave any marks on her chest. I told McMenimen to call me back
               if she remembered anything else about the vehicle or the
               suspect who threw the gravel at her. I also told her to call if
               she sees the suspect vehicle in the area. No suspects or leads
               at this time. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 10th day of September, 2015, in
               Pullman, Washington. _______________________________________
