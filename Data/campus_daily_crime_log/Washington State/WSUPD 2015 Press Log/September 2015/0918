               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W4262 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched
               to a report of suspicious activity in Bryan Hall. A white board

               was dispatched to a report of suspicious activity in Bryan
               Hall, located at 605 NE Library Road. I contacted the
               complainant, Carl L. Mayer (DOB 05-18-1954), on the telephone.
               Mayer stated that several classrooms on the 4th floor of Bryan
               Hall have been locked up and taken out of service. Mayer said
               the classrooms will be remodeled soon. Mayer reported that he
               noticed the white board in room #402 had been removed from the
               wall and placed on the floor. Mayer could not explain why this
               had occurred and was worried someone was intending to steal it.
               Mayer estimated that the white board was moved sometime between
               1700 hrs on 08-25-2015 and 0900 hrs on 09-18-2015. Mayer has
               advised custodial and teaching staff of the situation and
               requested that the doors to the classrooms be locked at all
               times. Mayer requested extra patrol of the building by the
               police department. No further action at this time. Olmstead/339

               a few minutes later and I spoke with him. He told me he was in
               the quiet lounge area of the CUB and he put his red in color
               Bank of America debit card in the front pocket of his
               sweatshirt around 1200 hours. He said he left the CUB and
               headed back to his fraternity and noticed his debit card was
               missing. He checked the lost and found desk at the CUB around
               1420 hours, but it had not been turned in. Yusen told me he
               went back again to the lost and found desk around 2120 hours,
               but his debit card was not there. We did not have any found
               property reports of debit cards at the police department on 09-
               18-15. Yusen told me he checked his bank statements already and
               there were no fraudulent charges on his card. However, he told
               me he was planning on canceling it. I asked him if he knew the
               number on his debit card, and he said no. He told me he was
               going to head back to the quiet lounge in the CUB to see if his
               card fell between the seat cushion he was sitting on. I told
               him to call me back if he found his debate card, and he said he
               would. No suspects or leads at this time. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               On 09/18/15 around 2244 hrs I responded to Todd Hall for a
               report of graffiti which was found in the third floor bathroom
               on the north side of the building. Upon my arrival I contacted
               a custodial employee, who was not identified, and led to the
               third floor men's bathroom on the north side of the building.
               As I entered the bathroom I noticed a large amount of graffiti
               on the interior door of the bathroom stall. I photographed the
               drawing and told the custodian she was free to clean the
               graffiti off the door. Upon clearing I returned to the WSU
               Police Department and after downloading the photo I cleared the
               call. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 19th day of

               warned for marijuana use. Walls was also warned for his alcohol

               3. Micah K. Manago (033196) Conduct Marijuana NARRATIVE: On
               091815 at approximately 2329 hours I was dispatched to the odor
               of marijuana coming from room 741 in Rogers Hall. I responded
               and met with RED Beck. He informed me the odor was coming from
               room 741. I went to the room and could smell the odor coming
               from the room specifically. I knocked and heard some movement
               and eventually the door was answered by Micah K. Manago
               (033196). He denied any knowledge of marijuana but when I told
               him to get anything he was not supposed to have, he began to
               but then he said he did not feel he should get his roommate's
               contraband. I clarified that the other male in the room,
               Anthony H. Tran (031597), was not his roommate. He was not. I
               spoke with Tran who appeared to be very nervous. When asked if
               he had smoked marijuana he obviously looked down and away from
               me and said he had not. I had him speak with me in the
               stairwell. He admitted that Manago's roommate had smoked in the
               room earlier in the evening and all three of them had been
               present. He denied having any marijuana on him. I had asked
               Manago to call his roommate, Joseph K. Walls (090196), and he
               did. Walls showed up and denied any knowledge of marijuana. I
               could smell the odor of intoxicants on his breath. He admitted
               to drinking 2 Bud lights. Walls kept denying an knowledge of
               marijuana and I asked Manago to speak with his friend about
               making the best decision. I stated if I had to come back later
               and ended up applying for a search warrant, they would most
               likely be dealing with more than Student Conduct. Manago told
               Wall to get his "dabs". Wall did so. Both Manago and Wall
               produced dabs. Manago had 1 portion and Wall had about 3
               portions. They disposed of them. They were free to go. I
               provided Hall Staff with the necessary information and cleared.

               Male continued to stumble down sidewalk and needed assistance

               19-15 at approximately 0034 hours I was on patrol in the area
               of Columbia St. I observed what appeared to be a male fall down
               on the sidewalk near the Education Addition building. There
               were a group of about four or five males standing near the
               male. I watched them help the male up and have to support the
               male as he stumbled southbound on the sidewalk on Idaho St. As
               I approached the male to see if he was okay, he appeared to be
               under the age of 21. I asked the male how old he was, and he
               said 20. The male identified himself as Adan Tamayo Garcia (DOB
               01-31-95). I told him I was audio and video recording. As I was
               speaking to Tamayo Garcia he was swaying in large circular
               motion, and he was having trouble keeping his balance. His eyes
               were bloodshot and watery, and I could smell the strong odor of
               intoxicants coming from his breath. I asked him for his phone
               number and he provided it to me. When I asked for his address
               he began to give me his phone number again, and asked him one
               more time to give me his address. Tamayo Garcia began to give
               me his phone number one more time. I asked him how much he had
               to drink tonight and he said he could not remember. I asked if
               he would take a voluntary PBT, and he said yes. He attempted
               two different times to provide me a sample, but would not blow
               properly. Tamayo Garcia went on to tell me that he had drank an
               18 pack of corona. Tamayo Garcia's friend's told me they would
               watch after him tonight. Martin Reyes (DOB 09-03-94) said he
               would be staying with him in his room in Orton Hall #242. I
               told Tamayo Garcia I would be forwarding charges on him to the
               Whitman County Prosecuting Attorney's Office for Minor
               Exhibiting the Effects of Consuming Alcohol in a Public Place.
               He seemed to understand. Tamayo Garcia and his friend's were
               polite and cooperative. I cleared the scene. No further action.

               NARRATIVE: On 09-19-15 at approximately 0049 hours Pullman
               Medics were toned out to intoxicated female in the front
               Stephenson Lobby. Dispatch advised the female has been puking
               and is unable to walk. I arrived on scene. The Resident Advisor
               on duty opened up the front door for me. Inside the lobby were
               two females on the nearby benches, and both of them appeared
               intoxicated. One of the females, who was later identified as
               Crystal L. Chase (DOB 09-16-96), was laying face down on one of
               the benches. The other female, who was later identified as Dara
               B. Eman (DOB 02-28-97), was on the other bench and was being
               supported up by another female. They told me they thought Eman
               was unconsciousness. They told me she is unresponsive and only
               mumbles. I asked Eman if she could hear me, but I did not get a
               response from her. Austin M. Clement (DOB 06-02-95) told me
               Chase's roommate called him to have him bring the girls home,
               but did not tell them how intoxicated they were. He thought
               Eman told him she lived in Stephenson, but she had said
               Stevens. Clement told me he knows Chase and that she lives in
               Rogers Hall. Clement told me he picked up Chase and Eman near
               California St. I started to talk to Chase, and she began to cry
               because she thought she was in trouble. Chase was able to
               answer simple questions with clear responses. I asked her how
               much she had to drink, and she said four cups of "jungle
               juice". She told me she was drinking at a fraternity, but
               unable to tell me which one. Eman was finally responsive and
               able to provide me with her information. Pullman Medics soon
               arrived on scene. I asked Eman how much she had to drink, and
               she said four cups of jungle juice as well at the fraternity.
               Eman told me she just wants to go home. I told Eman she could
               after the medics checked her out. Pullman Medics determined
               both females were okay. Chase immediately walked out the door.
               Eman was able to call a friend in Stevens Hall that said she
               would be able to take care of her. Pullman Medics cleared the
               scene. I provided Eman a courtesy transport to Stevens Hall and
               turned her over to Terlona J. Knife (DOB 03-27-97). Knife told

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W4280 SYNOPSIS: Officer observed subject
               speeding southbound on Stadium Way. Officer initiated traffic
               stop. Driver was under the age of 21 and provided a weak PBT
               sample of .013. Officer parked the vehicle and called a taxi
               for her. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Madison E.
               Saxon/04-19-97 Warned Minor Oper. Motor/Alcohol 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 09-19-15 at approximately 0135 hours I was traveling
               northbound on Stadium Way near Martin Stadium. I observed a
               silver, 2006 Pontiac Vibe (WA Lic. ANC6802) which appeared to
               be traveling over the speed limit. I activated my moving radar
               in vehicle 41, which displayed the Pontiac as traveling 30 mph
               in a posted 20 mph zone. I activated my emergency lights near
               Martin Stadium, but the vehicle did not pull over until they
               were near the Fine Arts parking garage entrance. I contacted
               the driver of the vehicle, who was identified by her WA
               driver's license as Madison E. Saxon (DOB 04-19-97). I told
               Saxon the reason for the stop, and she kept telling me "sorry".
               I could see her eyes were watery. I asked her if she had
               anything to drink tonight, and she told me she had a glass of
               wine around 2100 hours. She told me it was a small glass of
               wine. I asked her if I could check her eyes, and she said yes.
               I checked for HGN and I observed lack of smooth pursuit in both
               her eyes. I had to ask Saxon multiple times for her
               registration because she only handed me her driver's license
               and proof of insurance. I returned to my patrol vehicle and
               radioed Dispatch for a records check on Saxon, and her driver's
               license returned valid. I returned to Saxon's vehicle and
               handed Saxon her driver's license and registration back. I
               asked her if she would be willing to take a voluntary PBT. I
               told her it does not replace the evidentiary breath test and is
               inadmissible in court. She told me she would take it. I tried
               to administer it, but Saxon would barley blow on the breath
               tube and it gave me an error. I tried one more time and she
               provided a very weak breath sample and a I got a PBT reading of
               .013. I asked her if she knew what the legal alcohol limit for
               minors operating a motor vehicle in the state of Washington
               was, and she said "zero tolerance". I told her .02 and she
               provided me a weak sample. I told her she should not be
               drinking alcohol in the first place because she is under the
               age of 21. I asked her if I could park her vehicle and call her
               a taxi, and she said yes. Ofc. Westerman arrived on scene as
               backup officer. Ofc. Westerman parked Saxon's vehicle on Wilson
               Rd. near the French Administration Building. I asked Dispatch

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W4281 SYNOPSIS: Indecent exposure that
               occurred near Carpenter Hall. Male reported to be masturbating
               to passing women. Unable to locate suspect. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 09/19/15 at
               approximately 0204 hours I responded to a sex offense case that
               had occurred. Dispatch stated two females were reporting a male
               following them and masturbating. At the time of dispatch, I was
               informed that the suspect was leaving the area and heading
               towards Greek Row. As the call came out, Ofc. Gordon stated he
               was in the area of Campus St and Spokane St and would start
               looking for the suspect. Ofc. Tiengo and Ofc. Petlovany
               responded to the area and began looking for the suspect. I
               contacted Mayra A. Mendoza Flores 05/19/94 and Kimberley M.
               Ingrid Holguin P 07/07/94 who were hiding in their car. Flores
               told me that her and Holguin had been walking southbound on
               Spokane St along the engineering buildings when they noticed a
               male keeping pace with them on the opposite side of the road
               near Thompson Flats. They felt as if the male was following
               them. When they reached the area of Dana Hall they saw the male
               standing near Carpenter Hall next to a tree. Flores said she
               could see the male masturbating while looking at them so they
               called 911. I asked Flores and Holguin if they had seen the
               male's penis. Both said no. I asked them why they believed that
               the male was masturbating. Flores said he was making
               masturbating motions with his hand in his crotch area which
               lead them to believe he was masturbating. Flores also stated
               that as the male walked away it looked like he was zipping up
               his pants. Flores and Holguin provided the following
               description: -Male in his mid 20's -Green or blue hooded
               sweatshirt -Blue jeans -Unknown if male had facial hair or not.
               Flores and Holguin were approximately 150 feet away from the
               suspect when they made the observations. Flores and Holguin
               both stated they had never seen the male before. Ofc. Gordon
               contacted Dawson Cole Conway 11/16/95 who loosely matched the
               description. Conway was walking on Veterans Way near Morrow
               Hall. Conway was wearing a green shirt however that was the
               only similarity. After Ofc. Gordon interviewed Conway, Ofc.
               Gordon did not believe that Conway was involved. Officers and
               Cougar Security remained in the area until 0230 hours looking
               for the suspect. During that time nobody was found matching the
               provided description. At this time there are no suspects or
               leads. END OF REPORT I certify and declare under penalty of

               On 09-19-15 at approximately 0216 hours I was on patrol in the
               area of Veterans Way when a Cougar Security unit approached my
               patrol vehicle. He told me he witnessed a male and female
               arguing outside of the Old Bookie, located at 700 NE Thatuna
               St. He said the male kept asking the female to come home with
               him, but it did not appear like she wanted to go with him. He
               described the male as wearing a white shirt with jeans and a
               tattoo on his right arm. He said the female was wearing a black
               crop top and jeans. They were last seen sitting on the bench in
               front of the Old Bookie. I radioed Dispatch what the Cougar
               Security unit just told me. Ofc. Petlovany, Ofc. Gordon, Ofc.
               Harris and I responded to the area. There was no male or female
               in the area that matched the description, and nobody appeared
               to be arguing or needing assistance. I drove around the area
               some more, but still could not locate the male or female. We
               cleared the area. No further action. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
