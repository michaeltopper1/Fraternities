               POLICE DEPARTMENT ** COLLISION REPORT ** CASE #: 15-W3936
               SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched to a report of a non-injury vehicle
               collision near the Compton Union Building. A delivery truck
               collided with a light pole. DRIVER 1: Larry N. Kauffman (DOB
               03-12-1958) VEHICLE 1: white, 2015 Freightliner truck (WA Lic.
               53483RP) INSURANCE: Great Western Casualty / #GWP80165F / exp.
               07/2016 DAMAGE: no damage PROPERTY OWNER: WSU Facilities
               Operations DAMAGE: light pole was bent and cracked DAMAGE
               VALUE: $800.00 WITNESS(ES): n/a NARRATIVE: On 09-05-2015 at
               about 0839 hrs I was dispatched to non-injury vehicle collision
               on Terrell Mall near the Compton Union Building (CUB), located
               at 1500 NE Terrell Mall. I arrived on scene and contacted Larry
               N. Kauffman (DOB 03-12-1958). Kauffman was the driver of a
               white, 2015 Freightliner truck (WA Lic. 53483RP). The truck was
               registered to Triple B Corporation in Spokane, Washington and
               was labeled as a delivery truck for Charlie's Produce. There
               were no other passengers or witnesses. After speaking with
               Kauffman, I determined the following: Kauffman was backing the
               truck near the entrance to the east CUB parking lot. Kauffman
               did not see the light pole on the sidewalk, and the rear of the
               truck collided with the light pole. The light pole was bent,
               and the base of the pole had cracked. Kauffman did not complain
               of any injuries, and the truck was not damaged. I photographed
               the scene, and the photographs were downloaded into Spillman
               and attached to this case. I gave Kauffman a verbal warning for
               unsafe backing. WSU Facilities Operations responded to the
               scene and began repairing the light pole. No further action at
               this time. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this __06__ day of
               ___September___, 2015 in Pullman, Washington.

               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W3942 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched
               to a report of a fraud. The complainant had received some
               suspicious telephone calls requesting personal information.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 09-04-
               2015 at about 1347 hrs I was dispatched to a report of a fraud.
               I contacted the complainant, Elena L. Borne (DOB 04-24-1997),
               on the telephone. Borne resides at Rogers Hall #536, 1355 SE
               Olympia Avenue. Borne reported that on 09-04-2015 between 1330
               hrs and 1335 hrs she received two suspicious telephone calls on
               her cellular telephone. Borne's cellular telephone number is:
               818-524-0655. Borne said the male caller had a middle eastern
               accent and stated he was from a governmental department, but
               Borne could not understand him. Borne said the male knew her
               name and that she was a WSU student. Borne said the male told
               her she had an arrest warrant and told her to stay on the line.
               The male told Borne that she would be arrested if she hung up
               the telephone and began asking Borne to verify her name and if
               she was a WSU student. Borne said she hung up the telephone,
               and the male called back. The male was angry and was cursing at
               Borne. Borne hung up the telephone again and decided to report
               the incident to the police department. Borne identified the
               suspect telephone number as: 347-416-5132. While I was speaking
               with Borne, I looked up her name in the online WSU Directory
               and saw that her full name, cellular telephone number, and
               email address were listed. I suggested to Borne that she
               contact WSU Information Technology and inquire about having her
               personal information removed from the directory. Borne said she
               would do that and told me she had blocked the suspect telephone
               number from her telephone. I told Borne to contact the police
               department if she received any additional harassing telephone
               calls. After speaking with Borne, I called the suspect
               telephone number. A male answered and stated he was with the
               Internal Revenue Service. I identified myself as a police
               officer, and the male immediately hung up. I called back and
               again spoke to the male. I talked to the male about hanging up
               on me and warned him for making harassing, scam related
               telephone calls. The male stated, "are you fucking kidding me"
               and hung up. I tried calling the number several more times, but
               it had been apparently disconnected and would no longer ring.
               No further action at this time. Olmstead/339 I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               dispatched to a disorderly female on the 3rd floor of Morrow
               East. We responded to the area. Upon our arrival I saw an Asian
               female sitting in the office area of Northwest Public Radio and
               Darren Watkins was in the hall way. I contacted the R/P a
               Darren Watkins and Welter contacted the female later identified
               as Rebecca Ji. Watkins stated that Ji had been in Morrow East
               opening doors. She walked into several classrooms while class
               was in session. The instructors requested her to leave and she
               argued with them. She finally left then went to the NPR office
               on the third floor. Shed demanded to speak to someone at the
               station. When they asked her what she wanted she became very
               loud and argumentative. She wanted to get on the station and
               tell everyone how the government in the US and China were
               listening to all the phone conversations and the NSA was
               tracking everything citizens did. They tried to help her but no
               matter what they did it wasn't good enough. they told her that
               she couldn't get on the station she got very loud and began to
               argue with the staff there. While I was speaking to Watkins I
               heard the conversation between Welter and Ji. She was being
               very loud and was disturbing the officer staff. I told them
               that we would need to finish the conversation outside of the
               building. After much arguing with is Ji finally agreed to move
               outside the building. Outside the building Ji remained very
               upset about the situation. She continued to try and convince us
               that she need to speak to someone at the station about the
               government and what it was doing. She was not happy that she
               was being removed from the building. Both Welter and I explain
               to her several time that she could not just walk into classes
               and offices without permission. She insisted that she never

               Tiengo and I were on foot patrol in the area of Chinook Apts.
               We could hear a commotion near the B building. As we walked
               near, I could see a male subject laying on the ground on the
               landing near the stairwell to B10. I could hear people yelling
               at him to get up. We got closer and the male was standing with
               his arm around another person. I stood approximately 10 feet
               from him without the subject realizing this. I was talking with
               another person nearby and listening to the subject that had his
               arm around the other subject. The subject appeared under the
               age of 21 and sounded quite intoxicated. The subject was
               slurring his speech and talking about how he does not throw up
               when he's drunk. I asked the unidentified person I was talking
               to if someone was taking care of the drunk subject. The person
               said that the friend with him was going to walk him to Gannon
               Hall. I know Gannon Hall to be a residence hall where freshmen
               live. I watched as the subject stumbled away with his arm
               around his friend. I continued to talk with the other person
               for another minute. I noticed the drunk subject did not make it
               far and had stopped at the A building. Ofc. Tiengo and I walked
               over and I asked the subject where he was going and he said
               Gannon Hall. I asked him where he was at and he said Cheyenne.
               While I was speaking with the subject I could smell the odor of
               intoxicants on his breath and he was swaying in a circular
               motion. I asked the subject for his name and DOB and was
               provided, Sean H. Fareira 02/24/97. We had a discussion about
               underage drinking and I told him I would be forwarding the case
               to student conduct. We cleared. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 5th day of

               15 at approximately 2347 hours I was dispatched to a Welfare
               Check. Dispatch advised the complainant, Avis Choy (DOB 03-04-
               91), was calling from Hong Kong and was requesting a welfare
               check on her brother. She told Dispatch she has not spoken with
               her brother, Pok H. Choy (DOB 04-22-93), in over a month. I
               checked to see if Pok was registered for classes this semester,
               and he was not. I called the number listed for Pok and spoke
               with Janet L. Williams (DOB 04-10-49). Williams told me Pok
               lived with her and her husband as an exchange student. However,
               Williams said they have not heard from Pok in over a year and a
               half and she believes he has already graduated from WSU.
               Williams did not have another phone number for Pok. I emailed
               Pok at three different email addresses asking him to call his
               sister. I also sent him a message on Facebook. I have yet to
               receive a response from him. No further action at this time. I

               strong odor of marijuana outside of the southern stairwell. The
               RA's stated they had not seen anybody however. Upon arrival I
               walked around the exterior of the building but never smelled
               the odor of marijuana. At the time of the call it was raining
               which most likely aided in the dispersal of the odor. I found
               nobody outside of Rogers. I contacted the RA's and informed
               them that I had not found anything. After that I cleared. END

               released for Minor Operating a Motor Vehicle After Consuming
               Alcohol. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Rosemary Futse
               11-06-94 Cite/Release MOMVACA C09960 2. NARRATIVE: On 09/05/15
               at approximately 0212 hours I was stopped behind the
               defendant's vehicle at a red light at the intersection of NE
               Orchard and NE Stadium Way. We were in the left turn lane
               facing west. The defendant's vehicle turned left onto Stadium
               Way without using a turn signal. I stopped the vehicle on NE
               Wilson Rd. at Stadium Way. Ofc. Tiengo arrived on scene as back
               up. I activated my VieVu camera and contacted the driver. I
               advised the driver the reason for the stop and that the stop
               was being recorded. The driver advised that the left turn
               signal was broken. I asked for the driver's license,
               registration, and proof of insurance. The driver provided me
               with the registration and verbally identified herself as
               Rosemary Futse 11/06/94. While Futse was talking to me I could
               smell the odor of intoxicants coming from the vehicle. There
               was another passenger in the front seat. I asked Futse how much
               she had to drink and she said she wasn't 21 so didn't drink.
               The way Futse said it to me it appeared it was said "tongue in
               cheek". I asked Futse if I could check her eyes and she agreed.
               I administered an HGN test with Futse seated in the car. I saw
               a lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes. I again asked Futse how
               much she had to drink and she said just a little about 2 hours
               prior. I noticed Futse's eyes were bloodshot and watery. I
               returned to my patrol car and ran Futse's information on my
               MDC. Futse returned clear and current. I returned to Futse's
               vehicle and asked her if she would provide a breath sample to
               make sure she was not over the legal limit. Futse agreed. I
               told Futse the PBT was voluntary and did not replace the
               evidentiary breath test. I checked the PBT (FST # 62324) and
               found it in proper working condition. Futse gave a breath
               sample of .042 at 0220 hours. I asked Futse to exit the
               vehicle, which she did. I told Futse she was under arrest for
               being a minor and operating a motor vehicle after consuming
               alcohol. I handcuffed (D/L) Futse and advised her of her right
               to counsel. I reminded Futse she was being audio and video
               recorded. I placed Futse in the back seat of my patrol car.
               Ofc. Tiengo remained on scene and moved the vehicle and gave
               the passenger a ride home. I transported Futse to Pullman PD
               for the BAC. Upon arrival I spoke with Futse in Interview Room
               B. I checked Futse's mouth at 0232 hours finding no foreign

               substance. I read Futse her Constitutional Rights as 0234
               hours. Futse said she understood her rights and signed both
               signature blocks. I read Futse's Implied Consent Warning for
               Breath at 0236 hours. Futse signed that it was read to her and
               said she understood the warning. I asked Futse if she would
               provide a breath sample. Futse checked the "yes" box and
               initialed next to it. Futse provided a breath sample of .038
               (IR) / .038 (EC) at 0251 hours and a sample of .038 (IR) / .038
               (EC) at 0255 hours. The breath test was administered in
               accordance to the methods approved by the Washington State
               Toxicologist pursuant to the Washington Administrative Code. I
               provided Futse with a copy of the following documents: Driver's
               Hearing Request, Notice of hearing and conditions of release,
               and the breath test document. I issued Futse a criminal
               citation for MOMVACA. I explained the citation to Futse and
               provided her a copy. I provided Futse with a courtesy transport
               to Orton Hall. Futse is a Ghana citizen, which is a mandatory
               report country. I attempted to call the consulate, but they
               were closed. I sent a fax explaining the arrest. I did not
               photograph or fingerprint Futse and the fingerprint machine was
               not working. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 5th day of
               September, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.
