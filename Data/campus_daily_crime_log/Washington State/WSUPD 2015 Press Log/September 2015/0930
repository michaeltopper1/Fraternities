               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On September 30, 2015 at about
               0700 hours I was dispatched to a code violation at the Ruby
               Street Parks. WSU Grounds wanted contact regarding a tent that
               was erected at the park. I contacted WSU Grounds Supervisor
               Kappy Brun by telephone. I told Brun that people are not
               allowed to erect tents on campus per WAC 504-35-030 (11). She
               said one of her workers found the tent this morning. It is
               unknown how long the tent has been there. I responded to the
               Ruby Street Park. I located a green Coleman tent. There was
               nobody inside the tent. There were a couple of unopened wine
               bottles and some food garbage. There were no sleeping bags or
               personal belongings inside. I was contacted by an unidentified
               female who said the tent belongs to some women in a local
               sorority. The female said she will contact the owners and have
               them remove it. I asked the female to pass on to the owners
               that tents are not allowed on campus. No further investigation.
               I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws
               of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 30th day of September, 2015, in Pullman,

               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 09-30-15, Leonnides L.
               Beltran (06-05-93), called Whitcom to report he lost his wallet
               on the WSU Campus. He said he wanted a Police Officer to
               contact him via telephone. I called Beltran and asked how I
               could help. He stated he exited the Pullman Transit bus on
               Stadium Way near Martin Stadium at approximately 1436 hours on
               09-29-15. He then walked to his Psychology class in Johnson
               Tower. He said he knows he had his wallet when he got on the
               bus prior to his class, but realized it was missing when he
               tried to get back on the bus on 09-29-15 at approximately 1700
               hours. He described his wallet as a brown colored Michael Cole
               bi-fold. He said he purchased the wallet in July of 2015 and
               paid about $30.00 for it. He said it contained his WSU issued
               Cougar Card, his Washington State issued Driver's License, and
               his Debit Card issued by Chase Bank. Beltran checked with
               Johnson Tower as well as the CUB to see if his wallet had been
               turned in and it had not. I advised him to contact Pullman
               Transit to see if they found his wallet. I gave him a Police
               Case Number and asked him to contact me if he found his wallet.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W4583 SYNOPSIS: A woman was injured when
               walking in between Webster Hall and Shock Physics. Several
               cement tiles flipped over as she walked on them. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 09-30-15, I was
               called to the area between Webster Hall and Shock Physics.
               There is a "Floating Tileed" walkway between these buildings.
               Tammy D. Barry (06-11-69), was walking on this walkway when
               several tiles flipped up as she stepped on them. This caused
               her to fall down. She sustained scrapes to both legs and ankle
               areas as well as causing her right knee to swell. She said she
               wasn't overly concerned about the scrapes she received, but
               said her knee hurt quite a bit. I took photos of her injuries
               then gave her my business card with the Police Case Number
               written on it. I advised her she could contact the WSU Office
               of Risk Management if she had any medical bills. I asked
               Whitcom to contact WSU Facilities Operations and Environmental
               Health and Safety to respond to the location to evaluate the
               situation. It appeared as if one of the tile "Supports" had
               broken, which appeared to be the cause of the tiles flipping
               up. EHS arrived on scene and took over. I cleared. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.
               Dated this 30th day of September, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               was dispatched to the report of a theft. The RP, Grace S. Yoon,
               was requesting phone contact. I called Yoon and asked her to
               explain what was going on. She told me the following; she said
               that last night she tried to dock the green bike she had rented
               but it was not docking. She told me that she called the number
               for the ORC to ask them what they wanted her to do with the
               bike. She said that she was told to use the bike lock to lock
               it overnight, and the situation would be taken care of today.
               She said she locked the bike up with the provided lock outside
               of Goldsworthy Hall. She told me she has the key for the lock
               in her possession. Yoon told me that when she went to check on
               the bike this morning she noticed it was gone. She said that
               she called the ORC back to let them know. They confirmed that
               they did not have the bike and provided Yoon with a serial
               number of D02026 for the bicycle. I gave Yoon the case number
               and told her to call the Green Bike department to let them know
               she had filed a theft report and to give them the case number.
               I completed an NCIC form for stolen property and gave it to
               records. No suspects or leads. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 30th day of

               MEGGERSON, Malcom K. (12/16/92) Booked WC JAIL Warrant Arrest
               2. NARRATIVE: On September 30, 2015 at about 1230 hours Malcom
               K. Meggerson (12/16/92) came to the WSU Police Department to
               pick up his wallet that had been turned in. He advised WSU
               Police Records personnel that he had an outstanding warrant.
               WSUPD Records personnel verified that he did have an
               outstanding warrant for failure to appear in Franklin County,
               WA. I contacted Meggerson in the lobby and returned his wallet
               to him. Inside the wallet was a California Driver's License for
               Meggerson. He verified the correct date of birth. I advised
               Meggerson he was under arrest for his outstanding warrant. I
               had a copy of the warrant in my hand and showed it to him. He
               was handcuffed behind his back. I held the cell phone for
               Meggerson as he spoke with his girlfriend who called him. He
               later gave permission to turn his keys over to the girlfriend.
               I transported Meggerson to the Whitman County Jail. I read the
               warrant to him while in the booking room of the jail. I signed
               the warrant and retained a copy. Meggerson was turned over to
               Whitman County Jail. No further investigation. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               30th day of September, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               On 093015 at approximately 1716 hours I was dispatched to a non

               the two vehicle owners, Shuiwang Ji (080477) and Devendra H.
               Shah (052773) and determined that the passenger of the Honda
               Pilot (WA/AQW8556) had opened the passenger side rear door and
               may have struck the driver's side door of the Honda Accord
               (WA/AVU6286). I asked Shuiwang to point to where he thought the
               door had struck his vehicle. He pointed to a location that did
               not have a mark that I could discern. I took photos of each
               vehicle and prepared a Sector exchange of information. I
               provided a copy to each owner along with my business card. I
               cleared. Nothing follows. I certify and declare under penalty
