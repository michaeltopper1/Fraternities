               and 0810 hours, I parked on Wilson Road near Fine Arts to
               contact drivers on Wilson Road. I had been informed of recent
               complaints about people driving on Wilson Road who were not
               supposed to be there. While monitoring Wilson Road I talked to
               several drivers who came up Wilson Road. Every driver I
               contacted either had a handicapped placard or a mall service
               permit. One WSU employee approached me and thanked me for
               contacting drivers on Wilson Road. The unidentified employee
               expressed his concerns about the number of cars he sees on
               Wilson Road when it is supposed to be for pedestrians. Extra
               patrols will continue. END OF REPORT I certify and declare

               for the Washington Building called with questions regarding
               their alarm system. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 09-14-15 at about 1346 hours I was dispatched to
               an Others call. Whitcom advised that Donna Hash, the
               Administration Manager at the Washington Building was
               requesting contact regarding their alarm system. I called Hash
               and asked her what was going on. She told me the following; She
               said that she was notified today by the building custodian that
               when they arrived to work this morning the alarm had been de-
               activated and that there were random lights on throughout the
               building, that are not normally left on. Hash said that she
               looked at the alarm history and saw that the alarm had been de-
               activated using the "police code" at 8:20pm on 09-13-15 and
               never re-set. There was nothing out of place or obviously
               missing. I looked through our calls from the previous 24 hours
               I did not see any calls at the Washington Building, except this
               one. I saw that Sgt. Griffin and Officer Stewart were both
               working at 2020 hours last night. I checked their radio history
               and saw that they were both busy with other calls at that time
               and did not see at any time that they were at the Washington
               Building last night. I called Hash back and informed her of
               what I had found. I told her that it would be best to re-set
               the alarm code and asked her if there is anybody else that has
               the same code we do. She said no, that each department that
               would need access to the building (such as FacOps) has their
               own code. She told me that her IT security person is the one to
               provide alarm codes. Hash also told me that it is possible an
               employee entered the wrong number, and it was close enough to
               the police code that the system accepted it. I asked Hash to
               re-set the code and that it would need to be sent to me so I
               can disseminate it as well as to Whitcom. I told Hash that if I
               obtained any other information regarding this matter I would
               let her know. Nothing further at this time. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W4183 SYNOPSIS: Report of a suspicious
               subject attempting to meet with the Dean of the College of
               Business. Subject was gone when I arrived. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 09-14-15 at
               approximately 1650 hours, I responded to the report of a
               suspicious subject at the College of Business Dean's Office. I
               contacted the secretary, Sue Gilchrist, who stated earlier in
               the day a subject had come in and asked to meet with the Dean.
               They advised him the Dean was not available and he would need
               to make an appointment. He was told to come back at 4 pm. Prior
               to 4pm, they called the male, Derrick Fields Jr., and advised
               him he would need to email the Dean to set up an appointment
               with him. Fields returned to the office at 4 pm and stated he
               had not gotten the voicemail. They stated he was very agitated
               about not being able to meet with the Dean and made a comment
               that he had just lost the ability to have a lot of Interns. He
               also made a comment about his time being $75,000.00 per hour.
               They stated Fields had stated he owned a company and was
               wanting to speak to the Dean about it. When he was not allowed
               to meet with the Dean, he walked out causing a scene and
               yelling. They stated he scared them as his behavior seemed very
               irrational. They also stated he was a large man and had been
               intimidating. I spoke to Gilchrist and another employee about
               what to do when encountering subjects who were irrational. We
               talked about the panic buttons and tested one while I was there
               to make sure it worked and it did. I also talked to them about
               leaving the room and calling 911. They stated they understood.
               I advised them to call if they had any further issues with
               Fields. I did some checks on Fields and found he is out of
               Seattle and is not a student at WSU. I also found an
               involvement with him in Spillman from July by WCSO where they
               flagged him as an Officer Safety. The warning states: Subject
               Paranoid of LE. Use Caution when contacting subject. He is very
               paranoid with LE. Subject contacted on a traffic stop as a
               passenger and dialled 911 and said the officers were
               threatening his life and his constitutional rights were being
               violated, wanted to file a complaint, wanted more officers, and
               then requested an ambulance for having a panic attack. In the
               case this was generated from, I found he stated he owns, Herbal
               Standards Corporation out of Seattle. The company deals with
               medical marijuana. I found other cases involving Fields in
               Spillman where his behavior when confronted by officers was
               strange, and confrontational. I have sent an email to our
