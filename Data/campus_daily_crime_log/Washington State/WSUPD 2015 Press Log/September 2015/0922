               from the CUB. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: Chandler Leniu reported his I-pad was stolen from
               the CUB last Friday, 9/18/15. Leniu said he sat his I-pad on a
               table near Panda Express in the CUB on friday, 9/18/15, at
               about 1230 hours, and then went to the restroom and Subway
               before returning to the table. Leniu said he returned to the
               table at about 1245 hours, same date, and his I-pad was gone.
               Leniu said the I-pad was an Apple I-pad Air, and he believed it
               was worth about $400. Leniu said it was in a black case and the
               I-pad itself was black around the screen with a gray body.
               Leniu was unable to provide any addition information concerning
               the I-pad. When I asked Leniu if he had checked the lost and
               found at the CUB he responded saying he had not, but he was
               sure it wasn't there. Leniu continued to say he just needed a
               case number from the Police so Athletics could give him another
               one. No suspect, no leads, no further at this time. I certify

               was dispatched to the report of a cold theft, the RP was
               requesting phone contact. I called Henry J. Pappin, and asked
               him what was going on. He told me the following; he said that
               on Sunday, September 20, he had rented a Green Bike. He said he
               used the bike to run several errands then parked it, unlocked,
               in front of the Stephenson Complex. He said that sometime
               between 3:00 and 3:45 the bike was stolen. Pappin said that he
               had told a friend he could use the bike, and thought the friend
               had returned it. He told me that he did not realize the bike
               was not returned until he got an email from the "Green Bike
               People" stating he needed to return the bike. Pappin said that
               his friend does not know where the bike is either. He said he
               called the Outdoor Rec Center, the owner's of the bike, to ask
               what he should do. They told him to file a police report.
               Pappin was requesting the case number to provide to the Outdoor
               Rec Center. I gave Pappin the case number and my email address.

               accident on Stadium Way at entrance of Smith Center Parking

               Co. of America, #M1623059 NARRATIVE: On 9/22/15 at about 1220
               hours I responded to a two vehicle, non-injury, accident that
               occurred on Stadium Way at the entrance to the Smith Center
               parking garage. Before my arrival the vehicles had moved off of
               Stadium Way to the parking lot next to the McCoy Hall loading
               dock. After determining there were no injuries I learned
               following concerning the accident. Singh, driving the Nissan,
               was attempting to turn left onto Stadium Way from the drive way
               of the Smith Center parking garage. A vehicle in the outside
               southbound lane of Stadium Way had stopped for a pedestrian in
               the crosswalk. Singh believed he could enter the intersection
               and turn left before the Stadium Way traffic started moving
               again. Singh did not see the vehicle, Strickland, approaching
               the intersection in the inside southbound lane of Stadium Way.
               The front right corner of Strickland's vehicle contacted
               Singh's vehicle right behind the left front tire. The forward
               momentum of Singh's vehicle carried the damage from behind the
               left wheel down the rest of the left side of his vehicle. Singh
               said Strickland was the second vehicle stopped in the outside
               southbound lane of Stadium Way prior to him pulling into the
               intersection. As he pulled into the intersection Strickland
               pulled into the inside lane of Stadium Way and started through
               the intersection. Singh, who had a stop sign coming out of the
               Smith Center drive way, was warned he was responsible for
               yielding to traffic on Stadium Way. No infractions were issued
               at this time. No further. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this ____ day of

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: dd/329 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W4398 SYNOPSIS: Agency assist for WCSO to
               check on a subject who may have been intoxicated. Subject had
               not been drinking and was just upset over having to put down
               her dog. Assistance provided. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 09-22-15 at approximately 1600
               hours, WCSO requested an agency assist for a call out at Alpine
               Hospital. Alpine stated they had a female there with a dog who
               was requesting the dog be put down. They stated they believed
               the female was intoxicated and they were requesting an officer
               to respond to assist as she was very distraught. Ofc. Stewart
               and I responded and contacted the female who was sitting in her
               vehicle in the parking lot. She identified herself as Joyce
               Hatley. Joyce stated she had brought her dog in because she was
               very sick and old and she believed the dog needed to be put
               down. I did not smell any intoxicants emitting from Joyce and
               when I asked her if she had been drinking she stated no. She
               stated she had been sober for 6 months now and was just upset
               about the dog. I asked her if there was anyone we could call to
               help her and she said no. I had Ofc. Stewart remain with her
               while I spoke to the staff at Alpine. The staff informed me
               they had concerns about her being intoxicated. If she was
               intoxicated, then they would be unable to allow her to provide
               consent to have the dog put down. They also stated that when
               they tried to exam the dog, she had become very emotional and
               they had been concerned about their safety if she was impaired.
               I asked if they would be willing to examine the dog with us
               staying on scene and they stated they would. Joyce allowed me
               to take the dog inside and one of the Veterinarians examined
               the dog. It was determined the dog was very ill and did need to
               be put down. I asked if they would be willing to assist with
               that and they stated they would. I advised them one of us would
               remain to assist with Joyce. Deputy Nebe arrived and I advised
               him of what we had learned. He asked if we would be willing to
               take care of the call and I stated we would. I returned and
               advised Joyce of what the Veterinarian had stated. She asked if
               we would be able to provide her a ride home afterwards as she
               was very upset and didn't think she should drive. Ofc. Stewart
               stated he would and we arranged for his Intern to drive her
               vehicle home for her as well. Joyce consented to take PBT so we
               could verify she was able to provide consent and a reading of
               .000 was observed. Ofc. Stewart remained with her. When they
               were finished, he provided her a courtesy ride to her residence
               and her vehicle was taken to her house as well. All units

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W4402 SYNOPSIS: Female subject came to
               WSUPD and reported harassing phone calls from a suspected
               scammer. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 092215 at approximately 1913 hours, I was dispatched to a
               report of Harrassment and the reporting party, Cheyenne D.
               Crose, was at the WSUPD Lobby for contact. Upon arrival, I
               contacted Crose who told me the following. Since 092115 in the
               evening, she keeps getting phone calls from an unknown number.
               She told me she answered the phone and a male with a "middle
               eastern" accent told her she qualified for a US Grant. He began
               asking questions about her and where she lives and what
               university she attended. She answered all his questions and he
               told her she didn't qualify and hung up the phone. Crose told
               me he knew where she lives and she was concerned with him
               knowing that information. I explained that her university
               address is public information unless she has it removed at the
               registrars office. I explained that she should just ignore
               additional phone calls and maybe they would leave a return
               number. Crose told me she has no idea who has been calling her,
               but she wanted it documented. I gave her my contact information
               and told her to contact me if the problem persists. She thanked
               me for my time and left. Case inactive pending further leads. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 22nd day of September, 2015, in Pullman,

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W4408 SYNOPSIS: Subject reporting being
               harassed by a fellow student via text. The subject was
               contacted and warned to cease the activities. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Neil D. Cole/122796 Warned Harassment
               2. NARRATIVE: On 09/22/15 at about 2242 hrs Dispatch advised of
               a report from an RA of a student who was receiving harassing
               text messages from another resident. I responded and spoke to
               the resident, Kaitlin E. Koumaros (061297), who told me on
               09/17/15 she met a male, Neil D. Cole (122796), at a hall
               government meeting. She said he got her cell phone number
               through their involvement in hall government and has since been
               texting her repeatedly and has shown up at places where she was
               at. She said she just wanted Cole to stop texting her and not
               to try and talk to her unless it was at hall government. I told
               her I would contact Cole and relay the information. I went to
               room 825 Stephenson South to contact Cole. Cole seemed
               surprised by my coming to speak with him but said he
               understood. He mentioned an "awkward first kiss" between he and
               Koumaros. I made it clear to him at this point that Koumaros
               did not want to receive any texts from him or to see him unless
               it was necessary for hall government. Cole said he understood
               and seemed genuinely surprised by the issue. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 22 day of September, 2015, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer
