               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W4020 SYNOPSIS: Two vehicle, non-injury
               collision. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 09-08-15 at about 0848 hours WSU units were
               dispatched to an injury collision on Stadium Way near Beasley
               Coliseum. Sgt. Macy and I responded. I was first on scene and
               contacted Michael Kahn, the driver of a 1993 Honda Civic. Kahn
               told me that he was traveling southbound on Stadium Way and was
               stopped at the crosswalk near N. Fairway for pedestrians to
               cross. He said that while he was stopped the driver of a silver
               sedan rear-ended him. He told me that he thought the other
               driver was Dietrich Von Wettstein. He said that when he pulled
               off the road onto Ferdinand Lane, the other driver continued.
               Kahn said he thought the car would be parked on the north side
               of Johnson Hall. Kahn showed me a dent in his rear bumper as
               well as where it popped off on the passenger side. He told me
               that his neck was a little bit sore but refused an ambulance. I
               asked Sgt. Macy to attempt to find Von Wettstein's vehicle. I
               took pictures of Kahn's vehicle and gave him my business card
               with the case number. I told him I would contact him after I
               spoke with Von Wettstein. At about this time Sgt. Macy advised
               that he found Von Wettstien's silver sedan parked on the north
               side of Johnson Hall. I responded to his location. I looked at
               Von Wettstein's car and saw that the front license plate was
               hanging by one screw and there was a small amount of red paint
               transfer, consistent with the damage I saw on Kahn's vehicle. I
               went into Johnson Hall and began looking for Von Wettstein on
               the second floor. I found him and asked if he had been involved
               in a collision this morning. He said yes, but that he was fine,
               and he did not hit the other person that hard, so he continued
               on to work. Von Wettstein added that he did not feel like it
               was safe to stop because of all the traffic at the time. I
               asked Von Wettstein for his vehicle registration and insurance.
               Both documents were in his vehicle. I walked to his vehicle
               with him and retrieved the documents. I spoke with Von
               Wettstein about his duty in the event of a collision. He said
               he understood and apologized. I then called Kahn with the
               insurance information and provided it to him. I told him what
               Von Wettstein had said about not stopping because he felt it
               was unsafe. Kahn said "I agree with that assessment". I asked
               if there was anything else I could do for him and he said no.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 8th day of September, 2015, in

               her to call a phone number. It was determined who the person
               was via the telephone number. We are attempting to contact the
               Person. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 09-08-15, Lucia Soriano (01-06-88) called Whitcom stating
               someone had left several notes on her car asking her to call a
               phone number which was listed on the notes. Soriano lives in
               Steptoe Village, apartment V-202. Whitcom identified the person
               associated with the phone number as Wenxing Song. Song lives in
               Steptoe Village, apartment V-102. I contacted Soriano at her
               apartment. She showed me the notes which both read "Please
               contact me at 509-339-5641. Thank you". She said the first note
               was left on her car on Wednesday, August 26th, 2015. The second
               note was left on her car on 09-08-15. Soriano said she is
               unsure why the person wants her to call and is uncomfortable
               doing so. I told her I believe I know who wrote the notes and
               would contact the person to see why they left the notes. At
               approximately 1246 hours, I responded to apartment V-102 and
               knocked on the door. No one answered the door so I will try
               making contact again on 09-09-15. More to follow. I certify and

               contacted and he told me the contact will stop. Nothing
               further. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Omer A. Ahmad
               (021196) Warned Harassment 2. NARRATIVE: On 090815 at
               approximately 1642 hours, I was dispatched to contact Molly K.
               Bolke regarding a harassment call. Upon contact, Bolke told me
               the following. In April of 2015, she broke up with her
               boyfriend and was living in Stephenson East. At the time, Omer
               A. Ahmad was living a floor above her and offered to have sex
               with her. Bolke told me she declined and Omer had left her
               alone. Since week of welcome in August of 2015, Omer has been
               sending her Facebook messages asking her where she is living
               and to hang out. Bolke told me she has told Omer to stop
               contacting her two times via Facebook message and Omer keeps
               sending her messages. Bolke told me the messages don't amount
               to any threats or harassment, but they are just getting
               annoying because they are repeated. I told her I would contact
               Omer and explain that he needed to stop. I provided my contact
               information to Bolke and asked her to contact me if the problem
               persists. She thanked me and left. I responded to Palouse Trace
               Apartments where Omer lives and contacted him there. I
               explained that Bolke didn't want him to contact her anymore. He
               told me he understood. I told him that repeated contact over
               the internet could be classified as Cyber Stalking and repeated
               contact could amount to certain types of Harassment. Omer told

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W4031 SYNOPSIS: Report of a female acting
               suspicious and possible in need of help. Female was contacted
               and determined to be okay. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR#
               1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 09-08-15 at approximately 1659 hours, I as
               advised of a RP calling to report a female had approached
               acting weird. She had asked if he wanted to be her friend and
               then mentioned she was just coming from the doctors and was
               afraid to go home because of her husband. He stated while
               looking at her he could see old wounds on her arm which looked
               possibly like a previous suicide attempt. He stated the female
               stated her name was Trish and gave him her phone number. He
               said he last saw her heading towards Cenex and Tams. I had
               Whitcom advise Pullman as she was heading towards their
               jurisdiction. I then called the number provided and asked
               Whitcom to see if it was in Spillman. A female answered and I
               asked if her name was Trish and she said yes. I explained who I
               was and explained I was calling because someone was concerned
               about her welfare. She immediately asked if it was her husband
               who called and I said no. I asked her where she was and she
               stated at home. I asked her to tell me where she lived so I
               could contact her in person and she stated she didn't want me
               to contact her. She then stated she had another call and put me
               on hold. I was on hold for several minutes before the line
               disconnected. During this time, Whitcom advised the phone
               number came back to Patricia Greer who lives at 1155 SE
               Professional Mall Blvd #421. She had been recently contacted by
               Pullman PD for a welfare check. Ofc. Umbright stated he would
               head over there and asked if I wanted to go with him. I stated
               I did and responded to the location. We both activated our
               cameras and knocked on the door. A short time later, Trish
               opened the door and we asked if we could come inside to speak
               with her. She said yes and we went inside. Trish stated she is
               an alcoholic and had been drinking today. She stated she had
               two tall beers, but that was no very much for her. She admitted
               to talking to the RP and stated she was concerned her husband
               would be mad when he got home because she had been drinking. We
               asked if she was afraid for her safety and she said no. She
               stated she had called him already and had told him she had been
               drinking. She stated she was going to leave before he gets home
               and allow him to calm down before she returned. She also stated
               he would be picking up their young child from daycare. Trish
               stated she is due to go to inpatient rehab in the next few
               weeks. She stated her husband has agreed to go to counseling

               for his anger issues as well. We asked Trish about the marks on
               her arms which were all scars. She stated she used to be a
               cutter when she was younger, but hasn't done that for several
               years. We asked her if she was thinking of hurting herself and
               she said no. Trish was capable of caring for herself and stated
               she did not need any assistance. We thanked her for speaking
               with us and we cleared. I called the RP and advised him we had
               checked on her and she was fine. He stated she had called and
               was upset and first but then called back and seemed okay to him
               as well. He stated he would call if he had any further
               concerns. I cleared. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 8th day of September,

               hours I was traveling northbound on Spokane St when I observed
               a vehicle traveling at a high rate of speed southbound on
               Spokane St. I activated my Speed Measuring Device in moving
               mode. The SMD emitted a steady high pitched audio tone. I saw
               no other obstructions between my location and the vehicle when
               I obtained the reading. The SMD displayed a speed of 31 mph for
               the vehicle. At the time of the reading, the vehicle was alone.
               The posted speed limit on Spokane St is 20 MPH. I turned and
               activated my emergency lights, the vehicle(WA/AIF7499) pulled
               over. I contacted the driver, Kelsey R. C. Woodling(040996) and
               told her the stop was being recorded. I asked for her driver's
               license, registration and proof of insurance. Woodling provided
               the items but her insurance was expired. I could smell a strong
               odor of marijuana coming from the vehicle. I asked Woodling how
               much marijuana was in the vehicle. She said there had been but
               there was none at this time. I asked if she had a medical
               marijuana license, she said she did not. I asked if she would
               let me search her vehicle then. She said yes then asked if she
               had to let me, I said no, she then stated she did not want me
               to search her vehicle. I then explained to her she could tell
               me if there was marijuana in the vehicle or I could apply for a
               search warrant and if granted by the judge I could search the
               vehicle. I asked again if there was any marijuana in the
               vehicle. Woodling said she was not sure. There were three
               passengers in the vehicle, I asked if anyone in the vehicle was
               twenty one and if they had a medical marijuana license. They
               all said they were under twenty one and did not have a medical
               marijuana card. I asked again if there was marijuana in the
               vehicle. Woodling state there was but it was not hers it was
               one of her sorority sisters marijuana, and she let her leave it
               in her vehicle. The front seat passenger retrieved a baggy of
               marijuana from under her seat and handed it to me. I asked
               Woodling if she had smoked in marijuana and she said she had
               not. I asked if I could see her eyes and her tongue, she said I
               could, and I did not see any signs she had been smoking
               marijuana. I went back to my vehicle and ran Woodling through
               dispatch, she was clear. I then went back to the vehicle and
               explained to Woodling I would forwarding charges to the Whitman

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Boyd/335 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W4042 SYNOPSIS: Request for a welfare
               check for a subject who may be suicidal. Subject was contacted
               and it was determined they were not in need of assistance at
               that time. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 09/09/15 at about 0042 hrs Dispatch advised of a
               request for a welfare check on a subject. The complainant,
               Robert V. Fisher (121391), reported he was talking to his
               friend and she made some suicidal statements but did not make
               any specific threats. He did not know where his friend, Hayley
               K. Clement (080797), lived but knew it was in a dorm on campus.
               He also reported she has a history of cutting when she is
               intoxicated. I was able to determine Clement lived in room 154
               Regents Hall and went there to contact her. I knocked on the
               door and Clement answered. She said she was fine and I asked if
               I could speak with her. She got dressed and came into the hall
               to speak with me. She told me she had been speaking with her
               friend and had a small "meltdown" due to the stress of school.
               Clement said she "was done", which is what she assumed her
               friend took as being suicidal. Clement told me she was not
               suicidal and she was not as stressed as she had been
               previously. Clement's roommate was in the room with her but was
               not directly aware of the situation. It was clear Clement did
               not want to tell her roommate of the situation, which is why
               she wanted to speak in the hallway. Clement told me she had no
               intentions of killing or harming herself. I did not have any
               reason not to believe Clement and saw no signs of intoxication.
               I requested she contact Fisher just to let him know everything
               was ok. I called Fisher and told him I spoke with Clement and
               everything was fine. He told me the only statement Clement made
               that worried him was "I'm done". He said after she made that
               statement he tried to "talk her down" and only made her more
               upset. Once Fisher found out Clement's roommate was present he
               was no longer concerned for Clement's safety. Nothing further.
               I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws
               of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 09 day of September, 2015, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer
