    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Edwards/330 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W4710 SYNOPSIS: Report of an intrusion
               alarm. Unknown cause of activation. Responsible was notified.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 10-04-
               15 at about 0829 hours I was dispatched to the report of an
               intrusion alarm at USDA Greenhouse #109. Whitcom advised that
               the alarm was initially thought to be a fire alarm, and Pullman
               Fire Department was dispatched. Upon their arrival they
               determined the alarm to be an intrusion alarm and notified law
               enforcement. Upon my arrival I met with a FacOps employee who
               stated the building was secure and he did not know why the
               alarm was activated. We were able to make entry into the locked
               door and silence the alarm. I asked Whitcom to advise a
               responsible about the alarm and to have them respond to re-set
               the alarm, since it kept going off. There was no issues found
               at the building. The alarm was silenced and the building was
               secured. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 4th day of October,
               2015, in Pullman, Washington.
