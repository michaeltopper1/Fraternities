               On 10-25-2015 at about 0954 hrs I was dispatched to a request
               for a welfare check at Gannon Hall, located at 1459 SE Stadium
               Way. The complainant, Tami J. Dunlap (DOB 09-01-1960), reported
               that she had been contacted by her daughter's friend. The
               friend stated that she had received a telephone call last night
               from Gabriella N. Olague (DOB 10-04-1996). During the call,
               Olague stated she had attended a party last night and was
               raped. Dunlap requested a welfare check on Olague. At about
               1015 hrs Officer Whitman and I contacted Olague in her
               residence hall room, Gannon Hall #335. Olague was fine and said
               she had not been raped. Olague mentioned something about a text
               message conversation last night that was misunderstood. Officer
               Whitman and I cleared the scene. I later contacted Dunlap and
               advised her of the situation. No further action at this time.

               On 10/25/15 at approximately 2140 hours I was dispatched to a
               traffic offense on Stadium Way at Martin Stadium. The reporting
               party, Jesse Hallford, was reporting that a vehicle nearly
               struck him in the crosswalk at Martin Stadium. Hallford
               obtained the license plate, ANZ9443. I contacted the registered
               owner, Benjamin Maycumber. Maycumber told me he was very sorry
               and could not see the pedestrian due to his dark clothing and
               his wipers not working properly. I told Maycumber to pay closer
               attention and get his wipers fixed. I called Hallford and
               passed along Maycumber's apologies and he was satisfied. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 26th day of October, 2015, in Pullman,
