 15-W4746 Malicious Mischief               Vandalism by Graffiti
        Complainant: WSU PARKING SERVICES

                           PULLMAN              WA 99163

        Time Reported: 07:59
    Time Occurred between: 07:59:21 10/06/15 - 07:59:21 10/06/15

    Narrative: RVWD: 316 / OFC: Edwards/330 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W4746 SYNOPSIS: Report of graffiti in the
               NW staircase, SE staircase and near the elevators in the Fine
               Arts Parking structure. Unknown time frame for graffiti, no
               suspects or leads. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 10-06-15 at about 0759 hours I was dispatched to
               the report of malicious mischief in the Fine Arts parking
               structure. Whitcom advised that the original RP had already
               notified FacOps and sent them pictures of the damage. I called
               FacOps and asked the dispatcher if they had the pictures. She
               said she didn't. I called the original RP, Chris Boyan, and
               asked him to send the pictures to me, so I could determine if
               this was existing graffiti that had already been reported. He
               told me there was a lot of it and said their was graffiti in
               the NW stairwell, SE stairwell and near the elevator entrances.
               He told me that Cody Wilson, Parking Services Field Operations
               Manager, would send the pictures to me. At about 0855 hours I
               received an email from Wilson containing pictures of 15
               different locations with graffiti. The pictures were also sent
               to Jodie Magers at FacOps and later downloaded to the Spillman
               Files. I looked at the pictures and did not recognize the
               graffiti as being previously reported. Each graffiti instance
               costs an average of $25.00 to clean. The total cost of the
               damage is estimated to be about $375.00. No time frame for
               damage and no suspects or leads. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 6th day of
               October, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               #47-1945-W74 NARRATIVE: Sparks was north bound on Stadium Way
               in the inside lane with Connor following right behind him. They
               came to a stop at Grimes Way where Sparks was attempting to
               make a left turn into the Fine Arts parking garage. After
               stopping to yield to on coming traffic Sparks started to move
               forward, but immediately came to a stop again due to additional
               on coming traffic. Connor saw Sparks start to move but was then
               distracted and did not see him come to a stop again. At a slow
               speed Connor's vehicle struck the rear of Sparks' Scooter.
               Sparks and his Scooter fell onto the pavement. Sparks stated he
               was not hurt, but his helmet did strike the pavement putting
               large scratched on it. Sparks also said his cell phone in his
               pocket also suffered a broken screen. The rear of the scooter
               was bent slightly and Sparks said the scooter would not go into
               gear. Photos were taken of the scooter, helmet and phone.
               Connor did not believe there was any damage to her vehicle. I
               observed a small amount of paint transfer to the center of the
               front bumper, and a small dent on the hood. Sparks and Connor
               agreed on the sequence of events. Connor was informed she was
               responsible for the accident. Connor was not issued an
               infraction at that time. Information was exchanged between
               drivers. No further at this time. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this ____ day of

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Whitman / 323 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W4762 SYNOPSIS: Contacted a male who was
               sleeping in a room on the seventh floor of the Fine Arts
               building after the build was locked for the evening. The male
               was warned for trespassing and escorted from the building.
               Nothing further. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Beiro,
               Krystopher G./041776 Warned Crim Trespass 1st 2. NARRATIVE: On
               10/06/15 at about 2226 hours a Cougar Security unit was
               contacted by a janitor in the Fine Arts building who said there
               was a male sleeping in one of the rooms. The Cougar Security
               unit radioed dispatch and asked for a WSU Police officer to
               respond. Officer Welter and I responded. I observed there was
               no indications on the front doors of the Fine Arts building
               listing its open hours but the doors were locked and the
               majority of the lights were off inside. I spoke briefly with
               the Cougar Security unit and he showed us the room where the
               male was. He stated the room was an unused studio. The door to
               the room was locked and I keyed in. In the center of the room
               was a male sleeping under some sheets. When we entered and
               turned on the lights he woke up. He got up and put his shirt
               and began to put on his socks. I recognized him and asked if
               his name was Beiro. He said it was. I asked him what he was
               doing in the room. He said he was waiting for his friend to
               pick him up. I asked him where he lived and he said he was
               staying with friends on Airport Rd. I asked Beiro if he wanted
               to call his friend and see if they could pick him up, he
               declined. I had dispatch run his name, Krystopher Beiro, and he
               came back without warrants. I explained to Beiro that he could
               not be in the building and he needed to leave. He gathered his
               things and we escorted him out of the building. I went back to
               the station and looked at his local history which I neglected
               to ask dispatch about. Beiro had been cited on 10/02/15 for
               criminal trespass 1st by Officer Tiengo. In that incident Beiro
               was found in the Fine Arts building after hours as well.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 7th day of October, 2015, in
