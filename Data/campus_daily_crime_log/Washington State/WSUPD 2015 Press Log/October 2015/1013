               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W4956 SYNOPSIS: Dispatched to a
               drugs call at Northside Residence Hall. RED reported the odor
               of marijuana coming from a room. Confirmed the odor of
               marijuana, contacted, warned two males. Forward report to

               Patrick D. V./042195 Warned Poss of marijuana NARRATIVE: On
               10/13/15 at about 2133 hours I was dispatched to a drugs call
               at Northside Residence Hall. The RED reported the odor of
               marijuana coming from room 558. Officer Boyd and I responded
               and talked with hall staff. They stopped Patrick D. V. Porter
               leaving the room before we arrived he had Deion A. Singleton's
               Cougar Card with him. Porter said Singleton was in the room. I
               went to the room and could not smell an odor of marijuana
               coming from the door. I knocked several times and no one
               answered. Officer Boyd told Porter he could not keep the Cougar
               Card so we would keep it or he could use it to give it back to
               Singleton and let him know we were at the door. Singleton keyed
               into the room. As Singleton opened the door and entered I could
               smell a strong odor of marijuana. No one came back to the door
               so I knocked again. Singleton and Porter then came to the door.
               I asked both if the were under 21, they both said they were. I
               asked if either of them had a medical marijuana card and they
               said they did not. I asked Singleton if there was marijuana in
               the room. He said there was not. I told him I could smell the
               marijuana, he said I could search the room. I began to explain
               his rights for the search, and he then said he did not want me
               to search. Singleton continued to deny there was marijuana in
               the room but said someone had brought marijuana in earlier.
               Singleton was vague on the details of when and who had
               marijuana in the room. I warned both subjects for possession of
               marijuana and explained that my report would be forwarded to
               student conduct. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 13th day of
               October, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W4957 SYNOPSIS: Subject contacted for MIP

               student conduct. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Alexa
               K. Bright/062797 Fwd Chgs MIP Exhibiting 2. NARRATIVE: On
               10/14/15 at about 0020 hrs I was driving eastbound on Colorado
               St. passing Global Scholars Hall when I noticed two females,
               later identified as Alexa K. Bright (062797) and Megan M. Duffy
               (112794), standing between Global Scholars Hall and the Lower
               Soccer Field. They caught my attention because Bright appeared
               to be under 21 and was very intoxicated. Bright was leaning on
               Duffy for balance and stumbled as she walked. I stopped and
               contacted Bright and Duffy between Global Scholars Hall and the
               soccer field. I asked them to stop so I could talk to them and
               they did. I asked Bright how much she had to drink and she
               said, "not that much". Bright's speech was slurred and I could
               smell a strong odor of intoxicants on her breath. I told them I
               was concerned about how much Bright had to drink because she
               was quite visibly intoxicated. As I spoke to them I noticed
               Bright's eyes were droopy and she was swaying front to back as
               she stood. I asked Bright if she had any ID with her and she
               began to retrieve it. I asked how old she was and she said 18.
               Bright provided me with her student ID and date of birth, which
               was confirmed through Dispatch. I asked Bright if I could check
               her eyes and she agreed. I administered a horizontal gaze
               nystagmus test on her. I obersved she had bloodshot and watery
               eyes and a lack of smooth pursuit. Bright moved her head side
               to side during the test. I advised Bright I would be forwarding
               charges to the Whitman County Prosecutor's office provided she
               had never been arrested before. I confirmed she had no prior
               arrests. As I was waiting for the records check on Bright I
               asked if she would provide a voluntary breath sample so I could
               see how much alcohol was in her system. She agreed and provided
               a breath sample of .178 on alco sensor FST #5493. She was
               released to Duffy, who appeared to be sober. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 14 day of October, 2015, in Pullman,
