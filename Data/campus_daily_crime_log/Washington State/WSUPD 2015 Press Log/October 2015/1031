               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5436 10/31/15 SYNOPSIS: Type I barricade
               blew into street striking an oncoming vehicle on Stadium Way at
               the Cougar Statue. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On October 31, 2015 at about 1159 hours I was
               dispatched to a vehicle that was struck by a barricade on
               Stadium Way at the Cougar Statue. I responded to the area where
               I contacted the complainant and WSU Parking Services personnel.
               Due to the WSU Football game WSU Parking and Transportation
               Services has blocked off the parking lots for football parking.
               A hollow plastic type I barricade was set up blocking the
               driveway entrance to the Martin Stadium parking area. The
               barricade did not have any ballast in or on it at the time of
               the incident. It was positioned on the sidewalk curb at the
               edge of Stadium Way. A person was in the area to move the
               barricade as needed. Unfortunately they could not react fast
               enough to stop the barricade from entering traffic. The wind
               blew the barricade off the curb into the path of southbound
               vehicle traffic on Stadium Way. Leslie J. Davis (04/15/52) was
               driving his red Dodge Durango, AQU7109/WA, in the curb side
               southbound lane of Stadium Way when the barricade blew into the
               roadway. The barricade struck the front bumper, passenger side.
               The barricade punctured the front bumper. In addition the
               bumper was moved out of alignment. I estimate vehicle damage at
               $750.00. The barricade was not damaged. The weather conditions
               were wet, rainy and windy. The National Weather Service issued
               a wind advisory and hazardous weather outlook for Pullman. The
               wind advisory calls for "WINDS...SOUTHWEST 25 TO 30 MPH WITH
               GUSTS 40 TO 50 MPH. LOCALIZED SPORADIC GUSTS UP TO 55 MPH WILL
               BE POSSIBLE NEAR RAIN SHOWERS." According to the National
               Weather Service Pullman/Moscow Regional Airport reporting
               station, the weather conditions at 1153 hours were: 57 degrees
               Fahrenheit Winds West Southwest at 22 MPH with gusts of 32 MPH
               I documented the damage to Davies's vehicle. He spoke with WSU
               Parking Personnel. They added extra weight to the barricade and
               moved it back several feet from the edge of the roadway. I
               provided Davies the case number and contact information for WSU
               Risk Management. No further investigation. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               31st day of October, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               in center console of an illegally parked vehicle on Flag Lane.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               October 31, 2015 at about 1333 hours I was dispatched to Flag
               Lane where WSU Parking was out with an illegally parked
               vehicle. There was a weapon in the center console of the
               vehicle. I responded to the area. WSU Parking personnel told me
               they were checking on the vehicle because it must be moved to
               make room for football game buses. When they checked on the car
               they could see a tan colored handgun that resembled a model
               1911. The vehicle, AEB5090/WA, did not have any recent local
               involvements. It was displaying a Central Washington University
               parking permit. I asked Whitcom to contact CWU Police to
               inquire about contact information. I was provided the name
               Aaron J. Walker (05/18/97) and a telephone number 509-994-9927.
               I called Walker and he said the gun was a BB gun and he would
               be right out. Walker and another male came out to the vehicle.
               I asked permission to remove the gun from the vehicle. Walker
               said I could and handed me the car key. I unlocked the vehicle
               and retrieved the gun from the car. The gun was made of
               lightweight plastic and felt toy like. The tip of the gun was
               bright orange in color. The were no BB's or projectiles in the
               weapon. Walker said a friend of his left the gun in the car
               last night as people were dressed up for Halloween. Walker told
               me he is a Central Washington University student and this is
               his first time at WSU. I returned the plastic gun to Walker. I
               told him to secure it in the vehicle and not leave it out where
               people will see it and call about it. Walker was issued a
               parking ticket by WSU Parking Services. He was educated on
               where he can and can't park. He moved the vehicle without
               incident. No further investigation. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 31st day of

               Disorderly Conduct NARRATIVE: On 10-31-15 Cpl Edwards and I
               were dispatched to a citizens dispute in the alley behind
               Stevens Hall. Prior to our arrival dispatch advised that a
               black male and white male, later identified as Donat Halimi and
               Tariq Muhammad, arguing with two other males. Hall staff from
               Stevens hall advised dispatch that Halimi and Muhammad were
               leaving in a silver vehicle and the other two unidentified
               males had left heading west. I responded to Veterans Way and
               Edwards went to Spokane Street in an attempt to find the other
               two males. They were never found. I found Muhammad and Halimi
               sitting in a silver Nissan next to Thompson Hall. I told the
               two to open their windows and they complied. I asked the two if
               they knew why I was contacting them and they both said they
               didn't. I looked up toward the alley by Stevens Hall. I saw
               hall staff standing there. I asked if these were involved and
               they said it was. I told the two in the vehicle to turn the
               vehicle off and that there weren't free to leave. I went and
               spoke to Deserae Woodford. She stated that the black
               male(Muhammad) was found in Stevens Hall with no shoes. He was
               asked to leave and he went outside. She got a call from a
               resident concerned about him again and he was again found in
               the hall. She told him to leave and he went back outside. That
               was when Halimi arrived. The two began arguing and two male
               bystanders told Muhammad to chill out. This upset him and the
               four began shoving each other. Woodford told the four she was
               calling the police. Mohammah and Halimi went to their car and
               the other two headed west. I asked Woodford if she saw any
               punches thrown and she said it was only shoving. I told her she
               could leave and she did. I re contacted Halimi and Mohammad.
               They told he the same story except that Muhammad was pissed at
               Halimi for leaving him at the hall with no shoes. He had called
               him and Halimi took about an hour to come back. This pissed
               Mohammad off. When Helimi arrived that's when the yelling
               started. I told the two they were trespassed from the hall and
               to leave the area. The last time I saw them they were driving
               away. Nothing further.................. I certify and declare

               Chgs MIP Exhibiting 2. NARRATIVE: On 10/31/15 at about 1855 hrs
               I was working at the WSU vs Stanford football game. I was
               standing near the stairs that lead from the Student Plaza to
               gate I when I noticed a male, later identified as Ferdinan G.
               Feliciano (021897), who was walking up the stairs with a
               friend, who I did not identify. They caught my attention
               because they both appeared to be under 21 and were holding onto
               each other for balance. They were both staggering side to side
               as they came up the stairs. As I walked over to contact
               Feliciano he saw me and immediately let go of his friend.
               Feliciano stood up very rigidly as he was walking. It was
               apparent he was trying to walk without stumbling. I contacted
               Feliciano and asked how much he had to drink. He said not that
               much. I asked how old he was and he said 18. I asked for his ID
               and he provided his Washington Driver's license, which
               confirmed he was 18. As I spoke with Feliciano I could smell a
               strong odor of intoxicants on his breath. I noticed he had very
               bloodshot and watery eyes and spoke with slurred speech. I
               asked Feliciano if I could check his eyes and he agreed. I
               administered a horizontal gaze nystagmus test on him and
               observed he had a lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes.
               Feliciano moved his head side to side during the test. I told
               Feliciano he was under arrest for MIP Exhibiting. I told him as
               long as he was cooperative I would not place him in handcuffs
               and would escort him to the processing room. I escorted him to
               the processing room where I completed the ejection paperwork. I
               read Feliciano his constitutional rights from a pre-printed
               card and advised him he was being recorded. I read Feliciano an
               ejection warning and provided him with a copy. I explained I
               would be forwarding charges to the Whitman County Prosecutor's
               office for MIP Exhibiting and he was escorted from the stadium.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 01 day of November, 2015, in

               emergency vehicle access in the Regents Complex turnaround.
               Vehicles were impounded. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR#
               1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 10-31-15 at about 1858 hours I was
               dispatched to the report of a parking problem at the Regents
               Complex turnaround. Whitcom advised that there was a Honda
               Civic, WA/AEX0914, that was parked in the fire lane, blocking
               access to Regents Complex. I responded to the area and saw that
               there was two vehicles parked on the red curb, blocking the
               fire lane. The other vehicle was a Toyota Highlander,
               WA/AAP8668. I asked Whitcom to look for responsible person's
               for the vehicles. There were no local contacts for either
               vehicle or anybody associated with them. I asked Whitcom to
               dispatch two tow trucks to remove the vehicles from the fire
               lane. Meyer's arrived on scene and took possession of the Honda
               Civic. I provided the tow driver with a copy of the impound
               form and a copy was placed in the Civic for the owner. There
               was pre-existing damage on the Honda which I took pictures of
               and included in the case. Autobody Supercenter arrived on scene
               for the Toyota Hilander. The Honda needed to be moved away from
               the curb in order for the tow truck to completely hook up to
               it. The tow driver was attempting to gain entry into the
               vehicle to place it in neutral when the driver came out of
               Regents Hall. I identified him as Philip Chen. I asked Chen why
               he parked on a red curb, blocking a fire lane. He said he
               didn't know. Autobody Supercenter asked Chen to pay his impound
               fee before they would unhook from the vehicle. Chen paid the
               driver. I provided a copy of the impound form to the driver and
               to Chen. I warned Chen for parking in a fire lane. A copy of
               the impound forms were added to Spillman files. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under

               approximately 1922 hours Sgt. Cooper and I were working in
               Martin Stadium standing near the inner concourse of section 27.
               A female subject came up to me and said there was a guy
               standing up puking on the stairs at section 27. I looked over
               to section 27 and saw a male subject leaning backwards against
               the lower railing of the stairs vomiting on himself. Everyone
               in the crowd was pointing at him yelling to get him out of
               there. As I walked closer I noticed there was vomit on the
               stairs as well. I grabbed ahold of the subject and told him to
               walk with me, which he did. As we were walking the subject was
               very unsteady on his feet and was stumbling side to side while
               I was holding on to him. When we got to the outer concourse I
               asked the subject how old he was and he said 18. While the
               subject spoke to me his speech was very slurred and he had an
               overwhelming odor of intoxicants coming from his breath. I
               walked the subject to the processing and asked for his ID,
               which he provided. The subject was identified as Kyler T. Ortiz
               12/17/96. While I was completing paperwork Ortiz had a dazed
               look and just sat staring forward. Medics evaluated Ortiz and
               determine he was ok to be released to himself. I told Ortiz I
               would be forwarding charges on him for MIP-Exhibiting. I read
               Ortiz the ejection notice and escorted him out of the stadium.
               I watched as Ortiz stumbled away towards Streit Hall. Charges
               Forwarded. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this ____ day of _____________, 2015, in

               approximately 2025 hours Sgt. Cooper and I were working at
               Martin Stadium standing in the outer concourse near section 30.
               We noticed two male subjects walking towards us from the east.
               They caught our attention because they had their arms around
               each other's shoulders and they would stop and hug and then
               stumble on. As they walked together they were staggering back
               and forth and could not walk straight. Both subjects appeared
               under the age of 21. We walked over and contacted the two. I
               spoke with one of the subjects and told him we needed to talk.
               I told him he was way too drunk. As I walk talking with him he
               was slowly bringing his arm back up to put it on his friend,
               but would miss him. I asked him how old he was and he said,
               "I'm fucking 21." and then he stumbled towards his friend. As
               he spoke his speech was slurred and he reeked of intoxicants.
               The subject said he was going to leave and I told him I was
               going to eject him and he would leave. While I was speaking
               with him he could not stand still and kept stumbling around and
               would stumble towards me. I was holding onto his left arm and
               he grabbed ahold of my hand and at that point I asked him if he
               needed to go into handcuffs and told him not to touch me. I
               walked the subject to processing and as I did I could still
               feeling him stumbling around while I was holding onto him. As
               we were walking to processing I asked him where he lived and he
               said, "A St." I asked for the subjects ID and he provided me
               with his Cougar Card identifying him as Connor K. Proehl and he
               gave me his date of birth as 02/06/97, which made him 18. I
               asked Proehl where he lived and he said Gannon Goldsworthy. I
               asked which one and he said Goldsworthy, then Gannon. I told

               and I were walking through the outer concourse of Martin
               Stadium near section 26. Sgt. Cooper pointed out a female
               subject sitting on the ground against the wall. She appeared
               highly intoxicated and looked like she was slumped over. As we
               walked near I asked if she was ok and she put her hand up
               towards me as if she was asking for help to get up. Sgt. Cooper

               did not need to go to the hospital however she needed someone

               verbally abusive and was having difficulty standing up right on
               her own. I told Wallace that she was being detained and told

               passenger quarter panel, broken/crushed passenger side mirror.
               DRIVER 2: VEHICLE 2: WA ALD0062 a Burgundy 1998 Ford Explorer
               INSURANCE: DAMAGE: scratches/paint transfer to rear driver's
               side quarter panel and the driver's corner of the rear bumper.
               WITNESS(ES): NARRATIVE: On 10/31/15 at about 2340 hrs Dispatch
               advised of a subject calling to report he just backed into a
               vehicle in the parking lot between Avery and Stevens Hall. I
               responded and located the vehicle's. The reporting party stated
               he was backing out of the parking lot when he struck a vehicle
               that was parked, unoccupied. The vehicle that was struck was
               parked on the side of the parking lot and was not in a
               designated parking space, however there was ample room for Baca
               to have backed his vehicle out without striking the parked
               vehicle. Baca's vehicle, a blue 2010 Subaru Outback had a dent
               in the front passenger quarter panel and a crease down the
               front passenger door. The passenger side mirror was also
               broken. The parked vehicle, a burgundy 1998 Ford Explorer had
               some scratches/paint transfer on the rear driver's side quarter
               panel from the side mirror on Baca's vehicle and some paint
               transfer on the driver's corner of the rear bumper, from the
               side of Baca's vehicle. I photographed the damage and provided
               my business card with the case number to Baca. I told him I
               would leave a note from the driver with my business card and
               ask them to call me so I could facilitate an exchange of
               information between the two parties. I have yet to receive a
               phone call from the owner of the Explorer. More to follow. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 01 day of November, 2015 in Pullman,

               2. NARRATIVE: On 11/01/15 at approximately 0156 hours WSUPD was
               toned out to a fight in progress at Cougar Way and D St. I was
               already on Cougar Way across from Global Scholars and had
               noticed a crowd gathering at D St and was starting to drive
               there. Upon arrival I saw a male subject, identified as Bradlee
               A. Bartley, laying in the roadway. There were two other males
               providing aid. Witnesses told me that a while Impala was
               involved and had just driven down D St. I radioed this
               information to other officers and they located the vehicle on
               Stadium near Harvey (see supplements for their investigations).
               I asked Bartley what happened. Bartley explained that his
               friend had got into a fight with two people from a car and he
               was coming to help him when he got hit. Bartley said he did not
               know who hit him and did not remember much about the incident.
               I asked for medics to respond to evaluate Bartley, which they
               did. Bartley had a swollen shut right eye and an abrasion to
               the back of his head. I spoke with two females who said they
               saw someone wearing a banana suit getting back into the Impala
               and leaving. I asked them if they saw any assault take place
               and they said no. Ofc. Gordon arrived on scene and I told him
               the information that I learned. Pullman PD is handling the
               investigation. Nothing further. I certify and declare under

               approximately 0122 hours I was dispatched to a missing person
               report. I called the reporting party Elizabeth R. Simpson
               07/13/77. Elizabeth stated her and her husband, Ryan M. Simpson
               09/02/77, were at the WSU football game together. At the
               conclusion of the football game Elizabeth, Ryan, and several
               friends were leaving the game together and at some point
               Elizabeth and Ryan got separated. Elizabeth went with her
               friends to Moscow, ID where her and Ryan are staying for the
               weekend. After about 3 hours Ryan never showed up in Moscow and
               Elizabeth became worried. Elizabeth called Ryan's cell phone
               several times but he did not answer. I asked Elizabeth if they
               both had the plan to go back to Moscow and she said yes. I
               asked if Ryan had friend who were tailgating in the RV lots and
               Elizabeth said yes and she already called them. None of
               Elizabeth's and Ryan's friends had seen Ryan recently. I told
               Elizabeth that I would put out an ATL for Ryan and to have him
               call her if he was located. Elizabeth seemed happy with the ATL
               and I told her to call me if Ryan contacted her. I had dispatch
               put out an ATL to WSUPD, PPD, and WCSO. I called Ryan's phone
               several times and left a voicemail to call me back. I went
               through the RV lots and spoke to everybody I came across to see
               if they knew Ryan. Nobody that I spoke to knew of Ryan Simpson.

               arrival I met with the reporting party, Paige L. Harwood.
               Harwood explained that she came out of Regents's Hall and
               noticed a vehicle that had a broken windshield. She said she
               walked around the corner to check on her car and noticed that
               her car's windshield was also broken. I looked at the vehicle
               (OR 829GZS) and noticed that there were shoe prints and hand
               smears on the hood. It appeared that someone climbed onto the
               car and fell or jumped onto the windshield, breaking it. I also
               found scratches on the passengers side door and rear quarter
               panel. I photographed the damage to the vehicle. I provided

               NARRATIVE: On 11/01/15 at approximately 0207 hours I was
               dispatched to a drugs call at Rogers Hall room 839. The RED on
               duty called in that he could smell the odor of marijuana coming
               from the room. Upon arrival I also could smell the odor of

               the hallway where I talked to them. All three told me they were
               under 21 years old and none had a medical marijuana card. I
               told the three if they were willing to turn over all their
               marijuana and smoking devices, we would go down to the dumpster
               and destroy the items, and they would only be referred to
               student conduct. All three agreed and retrieved approximately
               one gram of fresh marijuana and a metal grinder. I explained
               the student conduct process to the three and told Nunez and
               Mankowski they were free to go. Mannon and I walked to the
               dumptser where he destroyed his illegal items. Once disposed of
               I cleared. END OF REPORT I certify and declare under penalty of

               0254 hrs I was stopped monitoring traffic on Stadium Way near
               Martin Stadium when I noticed a vehicle, WA ACK5929, that
               appeared to be traveling faster than the posted 20 MPH speed
               limit. There were several other vehicles around the subject
               vehicle so I could not get a good speed reading with my radar
               unit. I turned in behind the vehicle and paced the vehicle from
               martin Stadium to Grimes Way. I was following the vehicle at 30
               MPH and the vehicle was still pulling away from my patrol
               vehicle. I initiated a traffic stop on the vehicle, turning on
               my overhead lights. The vehicle stopped on Stadium Way near
               Gannon Hall. I contacted the driver, Joseph B. McElroy
               (022395), and told him the reason for the stop and the stop was
               being recorded. I asked for his vehicle registration, driver's
               license, and proof of insurance. He told me he did not have any
               of the requested information. He provided me with a name,
               Joshua Phillip and a date of birth of 022395. I noticed a small
               bag with what appeared to marijuana in the center console, as
               well as two 1/3 full bottle of liquor in the back seat. I asked
               McElroy about the items and he said he was borrowing a friends
               vehicle to drop off someone else. I had McElroy destroy the
               items so he would not have to be responsible for them. I ran
               the information provided by McElroy and did not receive any
               return. I told McElroy I believed he was not being truthful
               about his name. He was instant that the information provided
               was correct. After receiving no return again I detained McElroy
               to try and determine who he was. I read him his miranda rights
               from a pre-printed card. He said he understood them and
               verbally waived them. He continued to tell me the name provided
               was his name and said he was visiting his girlfriend but could
               not tell us her name. He also said he was a member of the
               Eastern WA University football team. I looked at the roster
               online and could not find the name he provided on the roster. I
               placed McElroy under arrest for nvol w/o ID. I read him his
               miranda rights and transported him to the Pullman Police
               Department. Upon arrival at Pullman PD he told me his name was
               actually Joseph B. McElroy. I ran McElroy through Dispatch and
               they advised that he had an ID through Washington, but no
               driver's license. I issued him citations for NVOL W/O ID and

               On 11/01/15 at approximately 0415 hours I was traveling north
               on Stadium Way near Vogel. I noticed a red van parked on the
               north side of Vogel with its lights on. I recognized the car
               from contacting it at 0350 hours when it was parked in the
               Green Lot outside of the CUE. At that time I contacted the
               driver and asked what he was doing. He said he had parked. I
               asked if it was because he had too much to drink and he said
               yes. I told him he needed to turn off the car so that he does
               not get into trouble. While I was talking to the driver, I
               noticed a passenger seated in the front passenger seat and he
               appeared to be asleep. I pulled into the parking area on the
               north side of Vogel Hall and parked to near the vehicle. I did
               not activate my emergency lights and the vehicle was not
               blocked from leaving. I walked over to the car and noticed the
               passenger was now laying face down in the back seat. The car
               was running at this time. I asked the driver why he moved over
               here and he said, "Uh?" I asked him the same question and he
               said, "I'm trying to drop him off." (pointing to the
               passenger). I asked the driver why he didn't stay in the other
               lot and he said that he thought we kicked him out. I told him
               that was where I told him to stay. I asked for his ID and he
               provided me with his Minnesota license, identifying him as
               Ephraim T. Safawo 07/31/97. Safawo said he was ok to drive and
               would take a breathalizer. I asked Safawo how much he had to
               drink and he said 4 shots about 4 or hours ago. I asked Safawo
               how long ago he drove from the other lot and he said 15 or 16
               minutes prior. Ofc. Boyd arrived on scene and I asked to use
               his PBT. I returned to Safawo and told him the PBT was
               voluntary and did not replace the evidentiary breath test. I
               checked the PBT and found it working properly (FST #5493)
               Safawo provided a breath sample of .060 at 0419 hours. I opened
               the back door of the van in an attempt to talk to the passed
               out subject. I was able to wake the subject up, but he could
               not answer any questions and only mumbled. Ofc. Boyd remained
               with the passenger and I asked for medics to respond. I asked
               Safawo to grab his items from the car, which he did. Safawo
               exited the car and I told him he was under arrest for Minor
               Operating a Motor Vehicle After Consuming Alcohol. I handcuffed
               (D/L) Safawo and advised him of his right to counsel. I

               reminded Safawo he was being audio and video recorded. I
               searched Safawo incident to arrest, finding no weapons or items
               of evidence. I placed Safawo in the back seat of my patrol car.
               Medics arrived and evaluated the passenger (who was not
               identified). I later learned the medics transported the
               passenger to a fraternity. I responded to Pullman PD for the
               BAC. Upon arrival I checked the BAC and found it working
               properly with the mouth tube warm to the touch. I checked
               Safawo's mouth at 0439 hours, finding no foreign substance. I
               read Safawo his Constitutional Rights at 0441 hours. Safawo
               said he understood his rights and signed both signature blocks.
               I read Safawo his Implied Consent Warning for Breath at 0443
               hours. Safawo signed that it was read to him. I asked Safawo if
               he would submit to a breath test. Safawo checked the "yes" box
               and initialed next to it. Safawo provided a breath sample of
               .047 IR / .048 EC at 0459 hours and a sample of .046 IR / .046
               EC at 0502 hours. The breath test was administered in
               accordance to the methods approved by the Washington State
               Toxicologist pursuant to the Washington Administrative Code. I
               provided Safawo with a copy of the following documents:
               Driver's Hearing Request, Notice of Hearing/Conditions of
               Release, and the Breath Test Document. I issued Safawo a
               criminal citation for MOMVACA. I explained the citation to
               Safawo and provided him a copy. I released Safawo and gave him
               a ride to the CUE parking lot to meet a friend. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 2nd day of November, 2015, in Pullman,

               found at Martin Stadium. Owner called and message left on
               voicemail. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 11/01/15 at approximately 0515 hours, Intern York
               brought a set of keys and WSU cougar card to me stating that
               she had found them in an Intern jacket she was putting away.
               York did not know which Intern had found the keys. York however
               remembered that the picture on the cougar card was the same
               person who had asked her earlier at the game if any keys had
               been turned in. The name on the Cougar Card is Brandon Tyler
               Kebba. I found Kebba in locals and called him. Kebba did not
               answer however I left a voicemail on his phone on how he could
               get his keys. I will pass the keys off to a dayshift Officer to
               give back to Kebba. END OF REPORT I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 1st day of
