               DEPARTMENT ** COLLISION REPORT ** CASE #: 15-W5124 SYNOPSIS: I
               was dispatched to a non-injury vehicle collision on Stadium
               Way. DRIVER 1: Shaun V. Darveshi (DOB 06-25-1985) VEHICLE 1:
               red, 1996 Chevrolet PU (WA Lic. C47334E) INSURANCE: Geico /

               Outback (ID Lic. 2CLX171) INSURANCE: Farm Bureau Mutual of
               Idaho / #01-B-023983-01 / exp. 01-14-2016 DAMAGE: rear of the
               vehicle extensively damaged DAMAGE VALUE: $3000.00 WITNESS(ES):
               n/a NARRATIVE: On 10-19-2015 at about 0835 hrs I was dispatched
               to a non-injury vehicle collision on Stadium Way at the
               intersection of North Fairway Road. Corporal Edwards, Assistant
               Chief Hansen, and I arrived on scene. I contacted the following
               individuals: Shaun V. Darveshi (DOB 06-25-1985) and Amy C.
               Ulappa (DOB 09-03-1982). Darveshi was the driver of a red, 1996
               Chevrolet PU (WA Lic. C47334E). Ulappa was the driver of a red,
               2002 Subaru Outback (ID Lic. 2CLX171). There were no other
               passengers or witnesses. After speaking with Darveshi and
               Ulappa, I determined the following: Ulappa was traveling
               southbound on Stadium Way and was approaching the intersection
               of North Fairway Road. Ulappa was traveling in the outside,
               southbound lane. Darveshi was traveling southbound on Stadium
               Way and was approaching the intersection of North Fairway Road.
               Darveshi was originally travelling in the inside, southbound
               lane and changed lanes to the outside, southbound lane. After
               changing lanes, Darveshi was now directly behind Ulappa. Ulappa
               stopped for a pedestrian in the crosswalk at the intersection
               of North Fairway Road. Darveshi was following too close behind
               Ulappa. Darveshi could not stop his vehicle. The front of
               Darveshi's vehicle collided with the rear of Ulappa's vehicle.
               Darveshi did not complain of any injuries. Ulappa said she was
               not injured but stated the back of her head hit the head
               restraint of her driver's seat during the collision. The damage
               to the vehicles was consistent with the information provided by
               the drivers. The vehicles had not been moved prior to my
               arrival. Corporal Edwards photographed the vehicles, and the
               photographs were downloaded into Spillman and attached to this
               case. I issued Darveshi infraction #12076 for Following Too
               Close. I completed a SECTOR PTCR. No further action at this
               time. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this __19__ day of

    Narrative: RVWD: 316 / OFC: Olmstead/339 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY
               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5136 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched
               to a report of trespassing in Orton Hall. The subject was
               warned and escorted from the building. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 10-19-2015 at about 1507 hrs I
               was dispatched to a report of trespassing in Orton Hall,
               located at 1475 SE Olympia Avenue. Corporal Edwards and I
               arrived on scene and contacted the complainant, Jenafer L.
               Doolittle (DOB 07-09-1988), in her office. Doolittle is the
               hall director for Orton Hall. Also in Doolittle's office was a
               subject who was identified as, Loen T. Pham (DOB 01-30-1994).
               Doolittle advised that Pham has been contacted several times
               inside Orton Hall and has been escorted out of the building by
               hall staff. Pham has also been caught using the laundry
               machines in Orton Hall. Doolittle advised that Pham was caught
               in the building again today and was using the laundry machines
               on the 2nd floor to wash his clothes. Pham is not a resident of
               Orton Hall and is no longer a WSU student. Pham has a friend
               who resides on the 5th floor of Orton Hall, but Pham has
               repeatedly violated the guest policy and has not been escorted
               by his friend when he is in the building. Doolittle mentioned
               that Pham might be homeless and might be sleeping in his
               vehicle. I asked Pham how he entered the building today. Pham
               said he waited at the door and followed someone in. I asked
               Pham if he had a place to stay. Pham provided his parent's
               address in Pullman, Washington, but he would not explain why he
               was not staying with them. I asked Pham if he needed assistance
               finding a place to stay, but Pham declined. After speaking with
               Doolittle, it was decided that Pham could still visit Orton
               Hall but only if he was in compliance with the guest policy and
               was escorted by a resident at all times. Additionally, Pham was
               no longer allowed to use the laundry facilities. I advised Pham
               that if he was found in Orton Hall, and it was determined that
               he had entered and remained in the building in violation of the
               guest policy, he would be subject to arrest for criminal
               trespass. I warned Pham that using the laundry facilities could
               be considered theft. I advised Pham that if he was found using
               the laundry facilities in Orton Hall again, then he would be
               subject to arrest for theft. I then explained to Pham that
               these rules applied not just to Orton Hall but to all the
               residence halls on the WSU campus. I again reiterated to Pham
               that if he violated these rules again in any residence hall on
               campus, then he would be subject to arrest for criminal
               trespass and theft. Pham said he understood my directives.

               Orton Hall. Pham removed his clothes from the laundry room, and
               we escorted him out of the building. Corporal Edwards and I

               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5147 SYNOPSIS: Disptach to report
               of an odor of marijuana coming from a room at Rogers Hall.

               student conduct. Nothing further. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Daisy J. Lowe/090396 Warned Poss of Marijuana
               2. NARRATIVE: On 10/19/15 at about 2120 hours I was dispatched
               to report of an odor of marijuana coming from room 536 at
               Rogers Hall. I arrived and could smell the odor of marijuana
               coming from around the door jam of the room. I knocked on the
               door and Daisy J. Lowe answered the door. There was one other
               female in the room, Morgan K. Hemstrom(082596). Hemstrom said
               she does not live in the room she was just visiting Lowe. I
               asked if either of them were 21 years old, they both said they
               were 19. I asked if either had a medical marijuana card, they
               both said they did not. I told them I could smell the odor of
               marijuana coming from the room. I asked if there was any
               marijuana in the room. They said there was not. I explained I
               would be warning them and forwarding my report to student
               conduct, because of the odor of marijuana. I explained they
               could gather any marijuana and other items they were not
               suppose to have in their room and I would observe them destroy
               it. I also explained the possible consequence of future contact
               for the odor of marijuana coming from the room. Lowe then
               admitted there was some marijuana in a grinder in the room.
               Lowe took a box out of a drawer under her bed and said that was
               everything she had in the room. She then implied that her
               roommate may have something in the room but she did not say
               what or where it was. I escorted her to the dumpster behind
               Rogers Hall. In the box she had a small glass marijuana pipe
               with marijuana residue in it, there was a grinder with
               marijuana in it and a baggy with marijuana in it. Lowe
               destroyed the items and threw them into the trash. She again
               mentioned that her roommate my have items in the room. Lowe
               thought her roommate , Elena L. Borne(042497), may be in the
               fifth floor study lounge. I told Lowe I would attempt to
               contact Borne. I went back to the fifth floor. A group was
               leaving another room on the fifth floor and Hemstrom said Borne
               was in the group. I said Borne's name and she came to her room
               where I was standing. I asked Borne if she had anything in the
               room she should not have, she said she did not. Borne said I
               could search her half of the room if I would like. I searched
               her half of the room and did not find anything. I explained to
               Hemstrom and Borne they would be in my report as contacted but

               Dispatch advised of hall staff at Gannon Hall reporting the
               odor of marijuana coming from room 407 Gannon Hall. I responded
               and as I approached 407 Gannon I could smell the odor of burnt
               marijuana. I put my nose to the crack of the door and could
               smell the odor of burnt marijuana emitting from the room. I
               knocked on the door an an a male, later identified as Kevin L.
               Gordon Jr. (111597), answered the door. With the door open I
               could smell a much stronger odor of burnt marijuana coming from
               the door and I noticed there was a towel across the bottom of
               the inside of the door. I know this is a common technique used
               by students to try and keep smoke/odors inside the room. I told
               Gordon I was there because there was a strong odor of marijuana
               coming from his room. I confirmed that Gordon lived in the
               room, and asked if the other male I could see in the room was
               his roommate. He said it was. I asked them both to step out of
               the room so I could speak with them and asked them to bring
               their ID's. They both exited the room and provided me with
               their driver's licenses, which indicated they were both under
               21. They both said they did not have any medical marijuana
               prescriptions. I told them it was obvious to me they had been
               smoking in the room. They agreed to go collect the remaining
               marijuana and any other illegal items they had and the incident
               would only be sent to student conduct. They retrieved an empty
               bottle of alcohol and a clear plastic bag with a small amount
               of marijuana inside, approximately 3 grams. I walked outside
               with them and had them throw away the bottle and destroy the
               marijuana. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 20 day of October,

               advised of a burglary alarm at the WSU Water Reservoir. I
               responded and began to walk up the hill on the southwest side
               of the reservoir. I saw two people walking down the hill
               towards me and contacted them. I asked what they were doing,
               they said they were up at the water reservoir. They said they
               were just checking out the water tower. I asked why they got so
               close, they said they were trying to read the sign. I asked
               what the sign said, they said "no trespassing". I asked if they
               damaged anything while they were there, they said they did not.
               Officer Stewart checked around the water reservoir and did not
               find any damage. Corporal Daniels asked if either of them
               climbed on the fence. Chapman said she started to climb the
               fence and then stopped when the alarm went off. Facility
               operations was notified to reset the alarm. I explained I was
               warning them both for criminal trespass and I would forward my

               Hall. I responded and upon entering the 4th floor from the
               elevator could smell the odor of burnt marijuana. I smelled the
               crack of the door at room 433 and could smell the odor of burnt
               marijuana emitting from the room. I knocked on the door and a
               male, later identified as Ovidio C. Rojas (102196), answered
               the door. As soon as the door opened I could smell an
               overwhelming odor of burnt marijuana. I told Rojas I was there
               due to the odor of marijuana and he said his friend just left.
               I asked if there was any marijuana in the room and he said no.
               I could see a glass pipe on the window ledge behind him and
               asked him about it. He showed it to me and I could see a very
               small amount of very burnt residue in the bowl but nothing
               sufficient to test. I asked Rojas if I could come in and look
               around. He said that was fine. Upon entering the room the odor
               of burnt marijuana was so strong it was obvious they had just
               finished smoking in the room prior to my arrival. I saw two
               empty bags on one desk that had fine hairs in them, which I
               recognized to be residue from marijuana. I told Rojas he should
               not be smoking marijuana in his room. I also told him I would
               be forwarding the incident to Student Conduct. Nothing further.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5154 SYNOPSIS: Report of a subject
               sleeping in an office. Subject was contacted and determined to
               be a grad student with keys for the building. No criminal
               activity occurred, case unfounded. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 10/20/15 at about 0521 hrs
               Dispatch advised of a custodian who located a subject sleeping
               in office 235 of Wegner Hall. Officer Whitman and I responded
               and contacted the complainant, Taylor G. Bartlett (020395), who
               advised us this was the second occasion in a week where she
               located the subject sleeping in the building. Bartlett directed
               us to room 235 and pointed toward an office in the back corner.
               I contacted a male who was sleeping in the office, later
               identified as Anh T. Ly (100992). Ly told me the office was his
               and he was sleeping there because he had been working until
               0300 hrs. I asked if he had keys for the building and he showed
               me he did have keys for the building. I told Ly I was not sure
               of his departmental policy about sleeping in the building. I
               told him it would be best not to sleep in the building because
               when the custodians find him they are going to call the police
               and we will have to come talk with him each time. Ly said he
               understood. Since Ly has keys for the building there was no
               criminal trespass occurring. This case is unfounded. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 20 day of October, 2015, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer
