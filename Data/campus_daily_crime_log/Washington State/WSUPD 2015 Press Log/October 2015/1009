               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W4829 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched to a
               report of a traffic offense. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 10-09-2015 at about 0843 hrs I
               was dispatched to a report of a traffic offense. I contacted
               the complainant, Laura G. Hill (DOB 05-26-1957), on the
               telephone. Hill said on 10-09-2015 at about 0830 hrs she was
               traveling westbound on Grimes Way. Hill said another vehicle
               was behind her as she traveled on Grimes Way. Hill said the
               other vehicle was tailgating her and then ran the red light as
               it turned right onto Stadium Way from Grimes Way. Hill
               described the vehicle as a large white pickup. Hill provided a
               license plate for the vehicle, and it was identified as an
               unknown color, 2005 Toyota (CA Lic. 7W25889). Hill could not
               see the driver of the vehicle but thought the driver was a
               male. The vehicle was listed as "vehicle registration
               suspended" through California. The vehicle registration
               displayed a Monterey, California address but did not list a
               name for the registered owner. I was not able to identify a
               local operator or address for the vehicle. No further action at
               this time. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Olmstead/339 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W4838 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched to a
               report of suspicious circumstances. The complainant reported
               she was receiving telephone calls from someone claiming to be
               from the IRS. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 10-09-2015 at about 1439 hrs I was dispatched to
               a report of suspicious circumstances at the WSU Children's
               Center, located at 1425 SE Olympia Avenue. I contacted the
               complainant, Ofelia M. Mendez (DOB 02-15-1991), on the
               telephone. Mendez is a WSU Children's Center employee. Mendez
               said on 10-09-2015 between 1330 hrs and 1430 hrs the WSU
               Children's Center received 4 suspicious telephone calls. The
               calls were received at the main reception desk for the center.
               The number for the main reception desk is 509-335-8847. During
               each call, a male on the line asked to speak with Mendez. Then
               the call was transferred from the reception desk to Mendez's
               classroom, where she answered. Mendez said the male caller told
               her he worked for the IRS and began asking her for personal
               information. Mendez told me she did not provide the caller with
               any information and hung up the telephone. Mendez was not able
               to identify the incoming telephone number, and it appeared that
               the caller was using some type of call spoofing application. I
               explained to Mendez that the calls were part of a scam, and I
               remembered taking a similar report several weeks ago. I
               explained to Mendez that she should continue to hang up if she
               received another call and reminded her to never provide
               personal information to an unknown and suspicious person. I
               told Mendez that the caller had most likely found her name and
               number on the WSU Directory. I told Mendez to contact me if she
               continued to receive the suspicious calls. Mendez said she
               would do this. No further action at this time. Olmstead/339 I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of

               vehicle parked in the start/finish of its race course. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 100915 at
               approximately 2050 hours I contacted members of the WSU Cycling
               Club who were setting up a cyclocross race course at the old
               golf course. The reportedly had permission to use the Tennis
               court parking lot and had marked the entire course. In their
               main start/finish location a WSU vehicle was still parked in
               it, blocking 50% of the lane. I offered some alternatives but
               they said they were not feasible based on their plans for fans
               and parking. They were told not to attempt to forcibly move the
               vehicle. I provided them with the number for dispatch if they
               needed it later. Ofc. Welter allowed me to check motor pool for
               a possible key for the vehicle. I was unable to locate a key
               and was unable to contact Motor Pool staff. When I returned,
               the club was gone. I cleared. Nothing follows. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W4845 SYNOPSIS: RA's called in an
               intoxicated female in room 607 of Goldsworthy Hall. Female was
               left in the care of her roommate. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Carmen A. Wasley 07/16/97 Student Conduct
               Intoxication 2. NARRATIVE: On 10/09/15 at approximately 2117
               hours I responded to Goldsworthy Hall room 607 where an RA was
               calling in a highly intoxicated female. Upon arrival I found
               Carmen Ann Wasley 07/16/97 laying in her bed with her roommate
               (not identified) tending to her. I asked Wasley a series of
               questions to determine her intoxication level. Wasley was only
               able to answer some of the questions correctly. While waiting
               for the medics to arrive I asked for Wasley's ID. The roommate
               began to look for it when all of a sudden Wasley decided to
               throw her body off the lofted bed. Wasley's roommate and friend
               caught her and Wasley was wobbly on her feet. I told Wasley to
               sit in a chair next to her so she would not fall down. I asked
               Wasley for her name and date of birth and she provided it.
               Wasley's words were very slurred making it difficult to
               understand her. Wasley had become more and more argumentative
               during my time with her. I started to run Wasley's name to
               dispatch however Wasley attempted to grab my notebook out of my
               hand. At this point I decided that it would be best to detain
               Wasley in handcuffs before she assaulted me. I stood Wasley up
               and she was flinging her body around instead of supporting her
               own weight. I pushed Wasley towards her bed so she could half
               lay on it as I handcuffed her since she did not want to stand
               on her own. Once handcuffed I sat Wasley back in the chair and
               again she flung her body around instead of sitting down
               normally. About this time Medics arrived on scene and I told
               Wasley that she needed to be compliant with them so they could
               evaluate her. Wasley became emotional after I sternly told her
               that she needed to act like an adult and cooperate with the
               process. Medics evaluated Wasley and spoke with her roommate.
               Medics determined that Wasley was highly intoxicated however
               they believed that Wasley's roommate could care for her. Medics
               cleared and I told Wasley that she needed to listen to her
               roommate and not leave the building. I told Wasley that if she
               was found outside the building tonight she would be arrested
               for MIP Exhibiting. Due to Wasley's high intoxication level and
               her behavior during my contact, Wasley will be referred to
               student conduct. END OF REPORT I certify and declare under

               McMillan 06/30/97 Charges Forwarded MIP Exhibiting 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 10/10/15 at approximately 0007 hours I was
               driving eastbound on Cougar Way near the D St when I noticed a
               male, later identified as Luke Edward McMillan 06/30/97,
               stumbling side to side as he walked eastbound on Cougar Way
               near the Old Bookie. The male was a stark contrast to another
               male who was walking normally just in front of him. McMillan
               would take a few steps then stop walking staring at his cell
               phone. Several times while standing still McMillan lost his
               balance and would stumble to one side or another. It did not
               matter if McMillan was standing still or walking, he could not
               keep his balance. I drove past the male slowly and when I saw
               his face he appeared to be under the age of 21. I parked in a
               parking lot past McMillan and walked towards him on foot. When
               McMillan and I met I asked McMillan if he had a second to talk.
               McMillan stopped and I asked him where he was walking to.
               McMillan said he was try to get home. I asked McMillan if he
               had his ID with him and McMillan pulled out a package of gum
               and started to remove a piece. I told McMillan that the gum was
               not his ID and he tried to put the gum back into the package.
               While trying to put the gum away he dropped the piece of gum to
               the ground. Once McMillan had all of his gum back into his
               pocket I again asked for his ID. McMillan pulled his keys out
               of his pocket and extended his hand towards me as if he was
               handing me his ID. I told McMillan that his keys was not his ID
               and asked if his ID was in his wallet. McMillan took out his
               wallet and passed over his ID several times. I pointed out
               where McMillan's ID was and he handed it to me. McMillan was
               identified as 18 years old. I asked McMillan how much he had to
               drink and he said none. I told McMillan that I believed he was
               lying based on what I had observed. I asked McMillan if he was
               willing to be more honest with me and McMillan again said he
               had nothing to drink. As McMillan spoke I could smell the
               overpowering odor of intoxicants coming from his breath. I
               asked McMillan if I could look at his eyes and he said I could.
               I told McMillan to stand with his heels and toes together and
               keep his arms at his sides. I instructed McMillan to follow the
               tip of my pen with his eyes only while keeping his head still.
               During the HGN test I observed equal pupil size, equal
               tracking, lack of smooth pursuit, and distinct and sustained

               nystagmus at maximum deviation. McMillan's eyes were bloodshot
               and watery. I again asked McMillan if he was willing to be more
               honest with me about how much he had to drink. McMillan said he
               had drank nothing. I told McMillan that he was under arrest for
               MIP and handcuffed (D/L) him. I advised McMillan that he was
               being audio and video recorded and read him his Miranda Rights
               of my department issued card. McMillan was searched incident to
               arrest and nothing of evidentiary value was found. Due to
               McMillan high intoxication level I did not believe he was going
               to be able to walk home safely. I drove McMillan to Gannon Hall
               where he lives. Once at Gannon I told McMillan that I would be
               forwarding charges of MIP Exhibiting to the prosecutor. I
               explained the process and released McMillan from custody. END

               10/10/15 at approximately 0015 hours I was dispatched to
               Northside Hall room 214 for an alcohol offense. The RA's were
               on scene with three intoxicated subjects, with one being 17
               years old. I responded and met with the resident, identified by
               WADL as Sage Huppe. Huppe was visibly intoxicated. Huppe had
               bloodshot and watery eyes, her make up was smeared, and she was
               staggering as she walked about her room. Huppe had a very
               strong odor of intoxicants on her breath. I asked Huppe what
               was going on and she said that her sister, her friend, and she
               had been out drinking on Greek Row (not specified where). Huppe
               said they all had too much to drink and now her sister and
               friend were passed out. I asked Huppe how old she was. Huppe
               said she was 19, her friend was 19, and her sister was 17. I
               asked Huppe if her parents knew her sister was visiting and she
               said they did. I asked Huppe to gather the other two's IDs,
               which she did. They were identified by WADLs as Michaela Huppe
               and Gabriela Gutierrez. I went to the bed where Michaela and
               Gutierrez were laying. I was able to get a response from
               Gutierrez by rubbing on her scapula. Gutierrez made some grunts
               and eventually said that she was in love with me. Based off of
               her statement and the odor of intoxicants on her breath I knew
               she was intoxicated. Gutierrez had a long line of slobber
               dripping from her mouth. I put a trash can on the counter that
               was under her to hopefully catch some of the seepage. I went to
               Michaela and was able to wake her from her slumber. Michaela
               said she was fine. While Michaela spoke her words were slurred
               and she reeked of alcohol. I noticed that the ID Huppe provided
               me for Gutierrez had a year of birth of 1994. This would make
               her over 21. I asked Huppe to find another ID for Gutierrez,
               which she did and it had the correct information on it. I kept
               the ID for destruction. Huppe provided me with her dad's name
               and phone number. I told her that I would be contacting him to
               notify him of the event. I told Huppe she had to stay awake and
               care for the other two, which she agreed to. I called Gerard at
               approximately 0600 hours and left a voice mail notifying him of
               the contact. I told him to call me back if he had further

               found on Campus St near Fulmer Hall. Female was taken into
               protective custody and transported to PRH for an Alcohol Detox.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Crystal L. Chase
               09/16/96 Student Conduct Intoxication 2. NARRATIVE: On 10/10/15
               at approximately 0033 hours I was driving northbound on Campus
               Street near Fulmer Hall when I noticed a female, later
               identified as Crystal Louise Chase 09/16/96, bent over a
               handrail swinging her head around. Another female, Niaylah
               Simone King 07/18/97, was trying to get Chase to keep walking.
               I stopped and asked King if Chase was ok. King said she was
               just trying to get Chase home. Chase was swaying around even
               though she was leaning over the railing. I asked Chase if she
               knew where she was. Chase said, "food services." Chase's words
               were extremely slurred as she spoke. I asked Chase a series of
               questions to determine her mental status. When asked what month
               it was Chase said January. I asked what month Christmas was in
               and Chase said September. I asked Chase what city she was in
               and Chase said Vancouver. Chase began to cry and King said
               Chase was very emotional tonight. I asked Chase what had
               happened to make her cry but she did not answer. King told me
               that a boy Chase was interested in would not talk to her. I
               asked Chase again what month it was and she said November. It
               was clear that Chase was so intoxicated that she needed to go
               to the hospital. I told Chase that I was going to have to take
               her to the hospital because of how intoxicated she was. I
               explained the process to King and she stated she understood. I
               told Chase to stand up and I had to assist her to do so. While
               handcuffing Chase she was letting herself go limp making it
               difficult to control her. Once handcuffed I told Chase to walk
               toward my car. Chase took a few steps and then made her body go
               limp. It was clear that Chase was purposefully not walking. I
               picked Chase up by her arm and was able to walk her to the car.
               Once at my patrol car she was placed in the backseat of my car
               and seatbelted in. I transported Chase to Pullman Regional
               Hospital where she was admitted in for an alcohol detox. Once
               Chase was turned over to medical staff I cleared. Back at the
               station I found out that this is the 2nd time Chase has been
               contacted in a month for being highly intoxicated. Chase will
               be referred to student conduct. END OF REPORT I certify and

               Ofc. Westerman reported he found a highly intoxicated female
               flopping on the ground near Owen Science Library. He was in the

               Westerman handed me Paola J. Romero's (021097) identification
               informing me she had been the one flopping on the ground.
               Romero confirmed she had drank alcohol, approximately 4 red
               cups of possibly wine. She had slurred speech and difficulty
               standing. I could smell the odor of intoxicants on her breath.
               I observed a lack of smooth pursuit and distinct and sustained
               nystagmus in both of her eyes. She was alert and oriented to
               where she was. She provided a breath sample of .255. I had her
               sit while not dealing with her or I felt she may fall over. I
               then spoke with her friend and neighbor, Cassigy J. Hagel
               (032997), who confirmed she had been drinking but she was not
               sure what. Her eyes were watery and bloodshot. I could smell
               the odor of intoxicants on her breath. She provided a breath
               sample of .143. I informed the two of them I would be referring
               them both to Student Conduct. I then provided them with a
               courtesy transport to Stephenson North. Hagel said she would
               watch Romero. Both were concerned that this would impact their
               respective Greek Chapter. I cleared. Nothing follows. I certify

               Abisola B. Babatola 11/30/95 2. Taylor D. Gaston 04/06/96
               NARRATIVE: On 10/10/15 at approximately 0146 hours I was
               driving on Cougar Way when I noticed a group of black subjects
               who appeared to be agitated. I parked near Global Scholars Hall
               and check out on foot. I started walking towards the group I
               had seen earlier and noticed Abisola Bidemi I Babatola 11/30/95
               and Taylor Danyel Gaston 04/06/96 were in each other's faces
               yelling. As I started to walk up the group I could hear
               Babatola yelling, "you want to fight?" Gaston told Babatola,
               "you better not since the Police are walking up." Babatola
               yelled, "I don't give a fuck." I contacted the group and
               separated Babatola and Gaston. I asked Babatola what was going
               on. Babatola said Gaston called her a bitch. After talking with
               Babatola for a while I figured out the following reason for the
               argument. Babatola and her roommate went out for the night with
               Gaston and her friends. Babatola wanted to go home but her
               roommate was the only person with a key to the apartment.
               Babatola wanted her roommate's phone number which one of
               Gaston's friends had. Somehow this caused an argument between
               Gaston. Babatola stated that all she wanted was her roommate's
               phone number. I asked Gaston's friend if I could write the
               phone number down and give it to Babatola. Gaston's friend gave
               it to me and I gave the phone number to Babatola. Babatola
               still wanted to argue and I asked if there was anything else I
               could do to help the situation. Babatola said she did not know
               how to get into her apartment. I explained to Babatola how to
               get in touch with her apartment coordinator. Babatola final
               left with a friend. I asked Gaston if Babatola leaving solved
               the problem. Gaston said yes. It appeared as Babatola was the
               aggressor in this argument. This case will be referred to Title
               IX since both females called each other "bitch." END OF REPORT

               Chandler J. Cone 06/04/94 Cite/Release DUI C09965 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 10/10/15 at approximately 0205 hours Intern McCrea and I
               were traveling north on NE Veteran's Way near Daggy Hall. I saw
               the defendant's vehicle traveling south towards my vehicle.
               Veteran's Way is a clearly posted "Do Not Enter" roadway,
               restricted for mall service permitted, handicap permitted, or
               emergency vehicles. I turned around and caught up with the
               vehicle on SE Idaho St. near SE Washington St. I activated my
               emergency lights and my VieVu camera, stopping the vehicle. I
               contacted the driver and advised her the stop was being
               recorded. I asked the driver if she had a mall service or
               handicap permit and she said she didn't. I asked for the
               driver's license, registration, and proof of insurance. The
               driver provided me with a temporary ID and continued to look
               for her registration and insurance. I driver was identified by
               WADL as Chandler Cone. I noticed as Cone was grabbing items in
               her car her movements were slow and deliberate. While standing
               outside the car I could smell the odor of intoxicants coming
               from the interior. There were two other passengers in the
               vehicle. Cone was able to provide me with her registration. I
               asked Cone where she was going and she said to the Chinook
               Apts. I asked Cone where she was coming from and she said
               "Mikes". I asked Cone how much she had to drink and she said,
               "Not that much." I asked Cone how much that was and she said
               one shot. While Cone was speaking her speech was slow and
               quiet. I asked Cone if I could check her eyes and she said I
               could. I administered and HGN test with Cone seated in the
               vehicle. I saw a lack of smooth pursuit and a distinct and
               sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes. I
               returned to my patrol car and ran Cone's information through
               Whitcom. I turned off my front facing emergency lights and
               returned to Cone's vehicle. I asked Cone to come talk to me.
               Cone exited the vehicle and meet me on the sidewalk. I asked
               Cone if she only had one shot all night. Cone said that a few
               hours earlier she had some beer. I asked Cone if she would do
               some field sobriety tests to make sure she wasn't impaired by
               the alcohol. Cone said she would. I administered the field
               sobriety tests on the sidewalk on the west side of the roadway,
               which was level and paved. Lighting was provided by overhead
               lights and my flashlight. The weather was clear with an
               approximate temperature of 50 degrees. Cone was wearing jeans,

               a black shirt, a jacket and canvas type shoes during the test.
               I explained to Cone that I would be evaluating her on how well
               she performed the tests and how well she followed my
               instructions. I cautioned Cone not to start any test until I
               told her to do so. Ofc. Tiengo arrived on scene around this
               time. The first test I administered was the HGN. I told Cone to
               follow the tip of my pen with her eyes only with out moving her
               head. I held my pen approximately 12-15 inches in front of
               Cone's face and administered the test. I checked Cone's eyes
               and noticed they tracked equally and her pupils were of equal
               size. I did not see resting nystagmus in either eye. I saw a
               lack of smooth pursuit and a distinct and sustained nystagmus
               at maximum deviation in both eyes. I saw an onset of nystagmus
               at approximately 40 degrees in both eyes. Cone was swaying left
               to right during the test. The next test I administered was the
               walk and turn. I told Cone to find an imaginary straight line
               and put her left foot on the line. I told Cone to put her right
               foot in front of her left foot touching heel to toe and leave
               her arms down at her sides. I told Cone to stay in that
               position while I explained the test. I told Cone that when I
               tell her to begin, to take nine steps touching heel to toe,
               watching her feet as she walked and count each step out loud. I
               told Cone that when she gets to step nine, to leave her lead
               foot in place and using her rear foot, take small steps around
               until facing the way she came. I told Cone to take nine steps
               back touching heel to toe and counting each step out loud. I
               told Cone that once she started, do not stop. I reminded Cone
               to count each step out loud, keep her arms at her sides, and
               watch her feet as she walked. I demonstrated the test and asked
               Cone if she understood and she said yes. I told Cone to begin
               at any time. Instruction Phase: Cone stood with her left foot
               in front of her right foot, which was opposite of what I
               explained and demonstrated. First Nine Steps: Cone began the
               test and counted her steps out loud until step 3 and then
               stopped counting out loud. Cone stepped off the line to the
               right on steps 1, 3, & 5. Cone stopped walking on step 3 and I
               reminded her to continue to 9. Cone stepped off the line to the
               left on steps 11, 13, and 15. Cone missed heel to toe between
               steps 3 & 4. Cone stopped on her 15th step and said, "I think
               I'm on 9." I asked Cone if she wasn't counting her steps out
               loud and she said, "No I think I went over 9." I told Cone to
               perform the turn and do the 9 return steps. Cone performed an
               improper turn by taking steps with both feet. Return Nine
               Steps: Cone began the test and missed heel to toe between steps
               2 & 3, 4 & 5, and 7 & 8. Cone took 10 return steps. The next
               test I administered was the one leg stand. I told Cone to stand
               with her feet together and her arms down at her sides. I told
               Cone that when I tell her to begin to raise the foot of her
               choice approximately 6 inches off the ground. I told Cone to
               point her toe forward, look at her foot, and count out loud by
               1000's until I tell her to stop. I asked Cone if she
               understood, and she said yes. I told Cone to begin at any time.
               Cone raised her right foot off the ground and held her arms out
               for balance. Cone was not counting out loud and I reminded her
               to count out loud and keep her arms at her side. Cone put her

               foot down, which was 8 seconds into the test. Cone then started
               counting from 1001. Cone leaned to her left and swayed left to
               right during the test. Cone counted 1012, 1014, missing 13.
               Thirty seconds elapsed on Cone's count of 1015. The next test I
               administered was the PBT. I asked Cone if she would submit to a
               PBT and she said yes. I checked the PBT (FST # 102460) and
               found it in proper working condition. Cone gave a breath sample
               of .114 at 0218 hours. At this time it was my opinion that
               Cone's ability to drive was impaired by alcohol. I told Cone
               she was under arrest for DUI. I handcuffed (D/L) Cone and
               advised her of her right to counsel. I reminded Cone that she
               was being audio and video recorded. I searched Cone incident to
               arrest, finding no weapons or items of evidence. I placed Cone
               in the backseat of my patrol car. Ofc. Tiengo facilitated the
               tow/impound with Meyer's towing. I transported Cone to Pullman
               PD for the BAC. Upon arrival I found the Draeger in proper
               working order, with the mouth tube warm to the touch. I read
               Cone her Constitutional Rights at 0233 hours. Cone said she
               understood her rights and signed both signature blocks. I
               checked Cone's mouth at 0233 hours, finding no foreign
               substance. I read Cone her Implied Consent Warning for Breath
               at 0235 hours. Cone signed that it was read to her. I asked
               Cone if she would submit to a breath test. Cone checked the
               "yes" box and initialed next to it. I asked Cone if she
               understood the warning and she said yes. Cone provided an
               invalid sample on her initial breath sample. I checked her
               mouth again at 0255 hours, again finding no foreign substance.
               I began fingerprinting and photographing Cone while waiting for
               the 15 minute waiting period. Cone provided a breath sample of
               .119 (IR) / .117 (EC) at 0315 hours and a sample of .122 (IR) /
               .120 (EC) at 0318 hours. The breath test was administered in
               accordance to the methods approved by the Washington State
               Toxicologist pursuant to the Washington Administrative Code. I
               provided Cone with a copy of the following documents: Driver's
               Hearing Request, Notice of Hearing/Conditions of Release,
               Tow/Impound Form, and the Breath test document. I issued Cone a
               criminal citation for DUI. I explained the citation to Cone and
               provided her a copy. I released Cone from custody. It should be
               noted that I set Cone's first appearance on 10/13/15 thinking
               that 10/12/15 was a holiday. I later found out court was in
               session on the 12th. I sent an email to the court notifying
               them of the mistake. Nothing further. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               12th day of October, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.
