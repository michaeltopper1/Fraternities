               NARRATIVE: On 10-24-15 I was dispatched to a theft of an I-Pad.
               The R/P reported he had just discovered his I-Pad Air had been
               taken from his vehicle. The R/P, a Raymond DeVries, stated he
               had just gotten a user alert from his I-Pad near the Green Lots
               across from Valhalla. He said he was not there and his I-Pad
               should be in his vehicle. I responded to the Green Parking Lot
               and contacted the R/P. He stated that the last time he saw the
               I-Pad was yesterday at 2000 hours at the Valley Road
               Playfields. He didn't know it was missing until he got the
               alert. We checked the vehicles and trash cans in the area, but
               it wasn't there. He tried to log onto the I-Pad via his phone,
               but it had been disabled. I asked him for there serial number.
               He said it was at his parents home and would call them later
               tonight. I told him I would notify IT and have them put a trace
               on the device. I told him to notify the department if he got
               another alert. He said he would. and we ended out conversation.
               Back at the department I realized I had failed to get the
               vehicle information from Devries. I called him at 2030 hours
               and got the vehicle information. He said his parents were out
               for the evening and would call them tomorrow. I told him that
               was fine and we ended the call. More to follow. I certify and

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5276 SYNOPSIS: Subjects contacted for

               Fwd Chgs MIP NARRATIVE: On 10/24/15 at about 2343 hrs I was
               driving northbound on Stadium Way from Nevada St. when I
               noticed a vehicle, WA ACJ1749, that was driving southbound on
               Stadium Way. The vehicle caught my attention because it
               appeared to be traveling faster than the posted 20 MPH speed
               limit. I activated my police traffic radar unit, VH 7, which
               emitted a high pitched audio doppler tone. The tone was steady
               in pitch. I observed a display on the radar unit of 30 MPH. The
               speed reading was consistent with my visual estimate of the
               vehicle's speed and the suspect vehicle was the only moving
               vehicle in the radar field at the time of the readings. The
               calibration of the radar unit was checked both before and after
               the stop by the use of factory certified tuning forks. The
               radar unit was found to be in proper working order. I turned
               around and initiated a traffic stop on the vehicle, turning on
               my overhead lights. The vehicle stopped on Nevada St. just off
               Stadium Way. I contacted the driver, and told him the the
               reason for the stop and the stop was being recorded. As I was
               speaking with him I could smell the odor of intoxicants
               emitting from the vehicle. I asked how much he had to drink and
               he said nothing. At about this time WSU Police Intern Sheets
               said he could see a bottle in the back seat. I noticed a bottle
               of Ciroc vodka laying on the floor between the rear driver's
               side passenger's feet. The passenger was later identified as
               Jordan D. Miller (092596). I could see all of the passengers in
               the vehicle appeared to be under 21 and were acting very
               nervous. I could also see a dutch bro's coffee cup in the back
               seat cupholder. It had a light colored liquid in it. I asked
               what was inside and Miller handed it to me. I smelled it but
               could not determine what was inside the cup. Miller also handed
               me the bottle of ciroc. I told everyone to give their ID's to
               Sheets while I had the driver, who I forgot to run through
               dispatch, step to the sidewalk. I asked the driver to perform
               some field sobriety tests and he agreed. I determined he had
               not been drinking. I asked him if I could search the vehicle to
               make sure there was no more alcohol in it. I told him he could
               deny the search and require I obtain a search warrant. I told
               him he could also restrict the scope of the search and change
               his mind about allowing the search at any time. The driver

               consented to the search. I searched the vehicle and found a
               bottle of gin, which was open, laying on the floor board of the
               rear passenger side of the vehicle. The passenger who had been
               sitting in that seat was Kyle A. Lohman (102496). I told the
               passengers that I was going to give them the opportunity to be
               honest with me and tell me who the alcohol belonged to.
               Initially they were silent. I looked at Miller and asked if he
               expected me to believe the bottle sitting between his feet in
               the vehicle didn't belong to him. He told me the alcohol was
               his. I looked at Lohman and asked him the same question. He
               said the alcohol wasn't his. I asked if he really thought I
               believed that, he said he didn't buy it. I told him I knew he
               didn't buy it because he wasn't 21. I told him I thought it was
               his and he was drinking it. He admitted he was drinking the
               gin. I had them both pour out the alcohol and asked if there
               was alcohol in the coffee cup, because it smelled like it might
               have alcohol in it. They said there was not any alcohol in it
               but they poured it out with the alcohol. I told Lohman and
               Miller that I would be forwarding charges to the prosecutor's
               office on them for MIP. The two female passengers in the car,
               Faith A. Roberts (102599) and Courtney N. Beidman (012898) did
               not appear to be intoxicated and did not have any alcohol which
               appeared to be under their control. Charges forwarded for MIP
               on Lohman and Miller to the Whitman County Prosecutor's office.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 26 day of October, 2015, in

               Exhibiting 2. NARRATIVE: On 10/25/15 at about 0005 hrs I was
               driving westbound on Cougar Way when I noticed a male and
               female who were walking eastbound on the sidewalk by the Lower
               Soccer Field. They caught my attention because the male, later
               identified as Aaron W. Enderlin (031496), appeared to be under
               21 and was having difficulty walking. He was stumbling side to
               side even though he had his arm around the female, later
               identified as Sara S. Croal (042596). It was clear Croal was
               providing Enderlin with assistance in maintaining his balance.
               I stopped and contacted Enderlin, asking if he could stop so I
               could speak with him. He stopped and I asked where he was
               going. He said home, behind Scott/Coman. I asked if he was 21
               and he said, "no I'm 20 actually, 19 actually". I asked which
               it was, 19 or 20, and he said 19. I noticed Enderlin spoke with
               slurred speech and had a strong odor of intoxicants on his
               breath. I asked if he had ID and he said he didn't. I asked if
               I could check his eyes and he agreed. As he was walking to a
               different part of the sidewalk he stumbled and caught himself
               against the fence to the soccer field. I began to administer a
               horizontal gaze nystagmus test. I observed Enderlin had
               bloodshot and watery eyes. I had to stop the test because he
               began to sway and stumble backward. I asked for Enderlin's name
               and date of birth, which he provided. The information was
               confirmed through Dispatch and asked them to confirm he had no
               prior arrests. I advised Enderlin I would be forwarding charges
               to the Whitman County Prosecutor's office for MIP Exhbiting. As
               we were waiting for the confirmation of his criminal history
               Enderlin asked me numerous times how much the ticket was. Each
               time I explained to him it was a criminal offense and the
               prosecutors office would decide if he was going to be charged
               in court or not. Enderlin was allowed to walk home after I
               received confirmation from Dispatch he had no prior arrests.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury

               approximately 0126 hours I was on patrol when I heard Ofc. Boyd
               radio he would be out testing. Ofc. Boyd had stopped a vehicle
               on a traffic stop in the parking lot of Streit Hall. I
               responded to his location as backup officer. When I arrived on
               scene he was doing field sobriety tests on a male later
               identified as Grant D. Mathers (04-02-97). I saw a blue, 2006
               Chrysler 300 (WA Lic. AKW5285) in front of Ofc. Boyd's patrol
               vehicle with a female in the front passenger seat. Ofc. Boyd
               completed administering the field sobriety tests and Mather's
               was arrested for DUI. Ofc. Boyd told me he could see a bag
               containing what appeared to be marijuana in the back seat
               underneath the driver's seat. I walked over to the vehicle and
               I could see the baggie laying on the ground. Based on my
               training and experience I believe that green leafy substance to
               be fresh marijuana. Ofc. Boyd also told me there was a glass
               pipe tucked inside the front passenger side seat. I walked
               around and could see a yellow and black glass pipe. The female
               passenger was later identified as Jenna E. Caneva (DOB 06-30-
               97). I told Caneva she needed to exit the vehicle because I
               would be applying for a search warrant, and the vehicle would
               be towed later. She exited the vehicle and left the scene. I
               asked Ofc. Boyd the reason for the traffic stop and he told me
               one of the head lamps was out on the vehicle. Ofc. Boyd
               transported Mather's to Pullman Police Department. I applied
               for a search warrant for the vehicle and was granted it.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5282 SYNOPSIS: Subject was arrested for
               DUI drugs. A search warrant was obtained and served for the
               subject's blood. Charges pending lab results. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Grant D. Mathers/040297 Fwd Chgs DUI 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 10/25/15 at about 0126 hrs I was driving
               northbound on Stadium Way approaching Lake St. when I noticed a
               vehicle, WA AKW5285, that was driving southbound on Stadium
               Way. The vehicle caught my attention because the passenger side
               headlight was not illuminated. I turned around and initiated a
               traffic stop on the vehicle, turning on my overhead lights. The
               vehicle stopped in the parking lot in front of Streit Perham
               Halls at the corner of Cougar Way and Stadium Way. I contacted
               Mathers and told him the reason for the traffic stop and the
               stop was being recorded. As I was speaking to Mathers I could
               smell the odor of burnt marijuana emitting from the vehicle. I
               asked Mathers for his driver's license, vehicle registration,
               and proof of insurance. As he was collecting that information I
               noticed a small bag of what I recognized, based on my training
               and experience, to be marijuana laying under the driver's seat
               on the rear floorboard. Mathers provided me with the requesting
               information. I noticed the date of birth on his driver's
               license made him 18 years old. I asked Mathers if he had a
               medical marijuana card and he said no. I asked why his vehicle
               smelled like marijuana and he said he was not aware that it
               did. I informed him it smelled strongly of burnt marijuana.
               Mathers denied smoking marijuana. I asked him to step from the
               vehicle and he did so. I asked for consent to search his
               vehicle and explained that he could deny the search and require
               I obtain a search warrant. I also explained he could restrict
               the scope of the search and change his mind at any time during
               the search. He said he would not consent to a search. I asked
               if Mathers would perform some voluntary field sobriety tests so
               I could make sure he was not impaired and he said yes. I had
               him move to the nearby sidewalk, which was straight with a very
               slight downhill slope. I told him I would be evaluating him
               based on how well he followed instructions as well as how he
               performed on the tests. Mathers said he understood. The first
               test I administered was the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. I
               told Mathers to stand with his feet together and his arms at
               his sides. I told him to follow the tip of my pen with his eyes
               only and not to move his head. Mathers said he understood. I
               held my pen approximately 12-15 inches from Mathers' face,
               slightly above eye level. I confirmed Mather's pupils were of

               equal size and his eyes tracked equally. I noticed at this time
               Mathers's pupils had a rebound dilation. I observed Mathers had
               very pink/bloodshot eyes and a lack of convergence in his left
               eye. Mathers moved his head slightly during the test and used
               his arms for balance. The second test I administered was the
               nine step walk and turn. I told Mathers to imagine a straight
               line down the middle of the sidewalk. I told him to put his
               left foot on that line and his right foot in front of his left,
               touching heel to toe. I told him to keep his arms at his sides
               and not to start the test until instructed to do so. Mathers
               said he understood. I told Mathers when instructed to begin to
               take nine steps, touching heel to toe, down the imaginary
               straight line. I told him to look at his feet, count each step
               out loud, and keep his arms at his sides. I told him once he
               reached his ninth step to leave his front foot in place and
               take a small series of steps with his back foot to turn around.
               I told him to take nine more steps back down the same imaginary
               straight line. I demonstrated the test and reminded Mathers to
               look at his feet the entire time, touch each step heel to toe,
               keep his arms at his sides, and count each step out loud. I
               told him it was a continuous test and not to stop until he had
               completed the test. Mathers said he understood my instructions.
               As I was explaining the test Mathers had extreme body tremors.
               Mathers swayed side to side as I was explaining the test and
               used his arms for balance once. During his first nine steps
               Mathers used his arms for balance on steps 0/1, 1/2, and 2/3.
               Mathers stopped after his ninth step and asked how to turn. As
               he was asking he swayed side to side and used his arms for
               balance. I told him to turn just as I showed him. Mathers
               turned and then stopped again, asking what else he was supposed
               to do. I told him to finish the last 9 steps as instructed.
               Mathers began his second nine steps and was not counting out
               loud. He began counting with 4 on his 5th step. Mathers took 10
               steps in his second nine steps. The third test I administered
               was the one leg stand. I told Mathers to stand with his feet
               together and his arms at his sides. I told him to remain in
               this position and not to start the test until instructed to do
               so. Mathers said he understood. I told Mathers when instructed
               to begin to raise one foot, whichever he was most comfortable
               with so his toe was about six inches off the ground. I told him
               to point his foot so the bottom of his foot was parallel with
               the ground and to keep both legs straight and his arms at his
               sides. I told him to look at his toe and count out loud by
               1000's (1001, 1002, 1003 and so on) until instructed to stop. I
               told him if at any time he put his foot down to pick it up and
               continue where he left off. Mathers chose to raise his right
               foot, standing on his left. He did not point his toe or look at
               his toe initially. He raised his toe approximately 4 inches off
               the ground. Mathers began counting 1-1000, 2-1000, 3-1000 and
               so on until his count of 6-1000 at which point he began
               counting 1007, 1008 and so on. On his count of 3-1000 I
               reminded Mathers to look at his toe. Mathers counted to 1000-24
               in 30 seconds. The fourth test I administered was the Rohmberg
               Balance Test. I told Mathers to stand with his feet together
               and his arms at his sides. I told him to remain in this

               position and not to start the test until instructed to do so.
               Mathers said he understood my instructions. I told Mathers when
               instructed to begin to close his eyes, tilt his head back, and
               estimate the passage of 30 seconds. I told him I did not care
               how he estimated the time just not to count out loud. I told
               him once he believed 30 seconds had passed to tilt his head
               forward, open his eyes, and say stop. I demonstrated the test
               and Mathers said he understood. During the test I observed
               Mathers had eyelid tremors, and extreme body tremors to the
               point his entire neck and jaw were shaking quite visibly.
               Mathers swayed side to side during the test. Mathers estimated
               30 seconds in 29 seconds and opened his eyes before bringing
               his head forward. At this time it was my opinion that Mathers
               ability to drive a motor vehicle was impaired by marijuana. I
               advised him he was under arrest for DUI and placed him in
               handcuffs (double locked). I advised him of his right to remain
               silent and his right to an attorney. I also reminded him he was
               being recorded. Search incident to arrest I located a small jar
               with a fine powder that smelled strongly of fresh marijuana in
               it. It appeared to be marijuana that was already put through a
               grinder. I placed Mathers in the back of my patrol car where I
               read him his constitutional rights from a pre-printed card.
               Mathers said he understood his rights and verbally waived them.
               I advised Officer Tiengo, who was on scene at this time, of the
               marijuana in the vehicle and asked him to handle a search
               warrant for the vehicle. I transported Mathers to the Pullman
               Police Department where he was allowed to speak to a public
               defender for as long as he wished. I read Mathers the Implied
               Consent for Breath warnings so he would be aware of the
               possible DOL sanctions regarding DUI. I put Mathers in a
               holding cell and returned to the WSU Police Department. I
               applied for, and was granted, search warrant #SW102515B, for a
               sample of Mathers' blood. I returned to the Pullman Police
               Department and had Pullman Ambulance dispatched to perform the
               blood draw. Once they arrived I read the search warrant in it's
               entirety to Mathers and the Ambulance Personnel. I watched as
               the back of Mathers' right hand was swabbed with iodine and
               blood was drawn into the two grey topped vials I provided by
               Jerid Hilderbrand of the Pullman Fire Department. I took
               possession of the vials after the blood draw was performed and
               later logged them as evidence. I put Mathers back in the
               holding cell while waiting for the search warrant on his
               vehicle to be completed. I later returned to the Pullman Police
               Departemnt after the vehicle was searched and the DUI impound
               tow was completed. I provided Mathers with a copy of the tow
               form and explained to him when and where he could pick up his
               vehicle. I advised him the search warrant and list of items
               seized from his vehicle was left in the vehicle for him. I
               provided him with a copy of the search warrant and list of
               items seized from the blood draw search warrant. I explained I
               would be waiting for the results of the blood draw to forward
               charges to the Prosecutor's office for DUI. Mathers was
               released. Charges pending blood draw analysis from the crime
               lab. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the

    Narrative: RVWD:MTK/336 OFC: Whitman / 323 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY
               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5288 SYNOPSIS: A male subject was
               concerned for a friends well being. He said they parted ways
               earlier in the evening with a plan to meet up later. The female
               subject did not meet with the male as planned. I contacted the
               female she was fine and did not want any contact with the male.
               Nothing further. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 10/25/15 at about 0655 hours dispatch was
               contacted by Joshua P. Eatherton. He stated he was supposed to
               meet a girl, Emily A. Schilb, this morning at his vehicle and
               she did not show up. Eatherton was concerned for her well
               being. I contacted Eatherton near Northside Hall and gave him a
               ride back to his vehicle in a parking lot at Linden St and
               Monroe St. He said he was with Schilb the night before and they
               parted ways on Greek row with a plan to meet up at his vehicle
               in the morning. When she did not show up he was looking for
               her. Eatherton said he had her phone number but his phone was
               out of charge. Eatherton plugged in his phone and attempted to
               call her, she did not answer. I asked him what number he had
               for her so I could confirm he knew her and was calling the
               right number. The number was the same number I found in local
               records for Schilb. I left Eatherton at his vehicle and told
               him I would contact him if I got in contact with Schilb. I
               called her and she did not answer, I left a message for her to
               call me back. I attempted contact at Schilb's dorm room, no one
               answered. At 1412 hours Schilb called me back. She said she was
               fine. She also said she barely knew Eatherton. Schilb said she
               met him the night before and gave him her number, that was the
               extent of their contact. She did not want any further contact
               with him. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 25th day of October,
               2015, in Pullman, Washington.
