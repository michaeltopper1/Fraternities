    Narrative: RVWD: LT: OFC: JAK/333 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT ** COLLISION REPORT ** CASE #: 15-W5319 SYNOPSIS: A
               school bus driver for the Colfax school district hit a parked
               car while trying to turn left in a WSU parking lot. DRIVER 1:
               William Allan Pennick (06-28-47) VEHICLE 1: 82058C/WA
               INSURANCE: Colfax School District - Self Insured DAMAGE: Damage
               to the driver's side lower panels between the front and rear
               wheel well area. I estimate the damage to be approximately
               $3000.00 DRIVER 2: The vehicle was legally parked in a parking
               stall VEHICLE 2: ARG1842/WA INSURANCE: Enumclaw Property and
               Casualty - AA00002319 DAMAGE: Damage to the driver's side of
               the front bumper, hood, front quarter panel, and head lamp
               areas. I estimate the damage to be approximately $3000.00
               WITNESS(ES): None NARRATIVE: On 10-27-15, I responded to the
               lower Routunda parking lot for a non-injury vehicle accident.
               Upon my arrival, I was waved down by a man I later identified
               as William A. Pennick (06-28-47). Pennick explained he had been
               driving a school bus; from the City of Colfax School District
               300 (82058C/WA), and had struck a Chevrolet Trailblazer
               (ARG1842/WA), which was legally parked in a parking stall.
               Pennick was attempting to turn left in the lower Rotunda
               parking lot on the WSU campus when he stuck the parked car and
               pushed it out of its parking stall. When Pennick stuck the
               parked vehicle it scraped and dented the driver's side of the
               school bus on its lower panel area between the front and rear
               wheel areas. I estimate the damage to be approximately
               $3000.00. When the bus hit the Trailblazer it damaged the
               driver's side front bumper, front quarter panel, hood, and head
               lamp areas. I estimate the damage to be approximately $3000.00.
               I took photographs of the damage to each vehicle and downloaded
               them into the "Files" section of the case. I determined the
               Trailblazer belonged to Miranda A. Chandler (09-21-78). Whitcom
               was able to find a phone number for Chandler. I called her and
               she responded to the scene. I explained what had happened and
               she said she understood. I gave Chandler and Pennick business
               cards with their case number and told them they could contact
               me with any questions they have in the future. Pennick told
               Chandler he had been advised to have Chandler get an estimate
               to repair her car and have the estimate sent to the Colfax
               School District 300 and they would pay for the repairs. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this ____ day of _____________, 2015 in Pullman,

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: KDS/326 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5327 SYNOPSIS: Jeanette Russell advised
               her ex-boyfriend keeps sending her text messages and making
               phone calls. She decided to attempt to deal with the situation
               between the two and call if she needs further assistance.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 102715
               at approximately 1631 hours, I was dispatched to a report of a
               Harassment in Olympia Hall. Upon arrival, I contacted Jeanette
               L. Russell who told me the following. Approximately two months
               ago she broke up with her boyfriend Christopher Hughes. She
               initially tried to remain friends with him and she indicated
               that it was not working out. On 100815, she told Hughes she
               needed more space and wanted to be the person who decided to
               contact him. After approximately two weeks, Hughes began
               texting her and leaving messages for her to contact him. After
               hearing the phone message, it was clear that he was confused
               about their relationship status. I asked Russell how she would
               like me to handle the situation. She told me she didn't want me
               to contact Hughes at this point, but wanted me to be made aware
               of the situation. I explained to her she needs to be honest
               with him. I suggested she tell him she doesn't want any contact
               with him. She told me she would contact him and take care of
               it. I provided her with my contact information and told her to
               call if she needed further assistance. I cleared shortly after.
               I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws
               of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 27th day of October, 2015, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer

               Possession of MJ<40gm. 2. NARRATIVE: On 10/27/15 around 2213
               hrs I was dispatched to a report of drug paraphernalia which
               had been located by hall staff during another contact in room
               609 of Stephenson East. I was asked to contact the reporting
               party, later identified as Andrew J Beck (06/22/91), and was
               later told the following. Beck explained hall staff members had
               contacted the occupants of room 609 and during the course of
               their contact had discovered what they believed to be a bong
               used to smoke marijuana. Beck wanted to know if they should
               take the bong and simply document the incident. We discussed
               this before I told him I would meet him at Stephenson East.
               Upon my arrival I spoke with Beck and hall staff who told me
               they had discovered the bong while dealing with an alcohol
               offense. I asked who the resident of the room was and was
               directed to an individual, later identified as Brennen C Moe
               (02/09/97). I asked Moe if I could come into his room and speak
               with him and told that would be fine. Once in the room I
               noticed the odor of fresh marijuana as well as seeing a glass
               bong which contained green residue and flakes inside, which
               based upon my training and experience resembled marijuana. I
               asked the other two occupants of the room, who were not
               identified to step out and spoke with Moe. Moe, who was
               compliant through the entire contact, told me the bong belonged
               to his roommate who was not there. He continued and admitted to
               having smoked marijuana, but not today. As I continued to speak
               with Moe I noticed his pupils were dilated and slow to react
               with the light in the room and later in the hallway. As we
               continued to speak he admitted to having consumed alcohol but
               steadily denied to smoking any marijuana. When I asked him if
               there was any additional marijuana in the room he pulled a
               small sandwich bag which contained a small amount of green
               vegetable material which resembled marijuana. Moe offered to
               destroy the remaining marijuana and prior to leaving we spoke
               with Beck and the other occupants of the room. I explained to
               Beck that Moe had been compliant and it might be in his
               interest to document the bong belonged to Moe's roommate. Prior
               to leaving I was told the reason for the contact had been one
               of the individuals had been pointing a laser pointer out of the
               window at other rooms. We had a conversation about this and the

               F. Frow/021797 Warned Poss Marijuana 2. NARRATIVE: On 10/28/15
               at about 0034 hrs Dispatch advised that hall staff at
               Stephenson North were reporting the odor of marijuana coming
               from room 315. I responded and one I arrived at the room I
               could smell the odor of burnt marijuana emitting from the room.
               I knocked on the door and a male, later identified as Justin F.
               Frow, answered the door. I asked if he lived there and he said
               yes. He told me his roommate was gone at work. With the door
               open I could smell a very strong odor of burnt marijuana coming
               from the room. I could see a towel rolled up at the bottom of
               the door, which I know is one way students attempt to keep the
               odor of burnt marijuana in the room. I asked Frow if he was
               smoking in the room and initially he said no. I asked for his
               ID, which he provided and I ran through Dispatch. I asked Frow
               again who was smoking marijuana in the room because it's his
               room and I believed he knew what was going on inside. He then
               admitted he had some friends over and they smoked marijuana in
               his room. Frow agreed to retrieve the remaining marijuana from
               the room. He brought out approximately 2 grams of marijuana in
               a small metal container and a glass pipe. I walked outside with
               Frow and watched him throw away the pipe and marijuana. The
               incident will be referred to student conduct. Nothing further.
               I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws
