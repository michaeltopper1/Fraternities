               about 1026 hours I was dispatched to a suspicious backpack next
               to the gas meter at ETRL. I responded to the area and located
               the black backpack. I spoke with personnel working for a
               utility locating company. They said the backpack belongs to ELM
               Utility Locating & Utility Services. ELM is locating natural
               gas lines in the area and the other company us locating water,
               storm, and sewer lines. The backpack was open and contained
               utility locating equipment that was hooked to a ground rod and
               the gas meter. There was no emergency so I cleared the area. At
               about 1120 hours Whitcom advised me that they had received
               additional calls about the bag and instrument inside of it. I
               responded back to the area where I made contact with Ethan R.
               Stepper (01/17/80), ELM Locating. Stepper told me he is done
               working in the area of ETRL but has additional work to do on
               campus. I suggested he place cones around the instrument when
               it is hooked up. Stepper provided me with his contact
               information to call him if another report comes in. Stepper
               left the area with all of his equipment. No further
               investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury

               was dispatched to a blue phone activation behind Smith Gym. The
               caller stated they found a female balled up and vomiting behind
               PEB. Ofc. Westerman, Ofc. Whitman, and I responded. When I
               arrived on scene I found a female sitting against a corner wall
               of the building vomiting. She was alert, but not to responsive
               to questions. I was able to finally ascertain her name, Stefani
               S. Anciso 01/23/96, although she spelled it wrong and said she
               did not have a middle name. While Anciso spoke her words were
               extremely slurred and most of the time unintelligible. Anciso
               told me she lived at Cougar Country, and then Cougar Ridge, and
               then Boulder Creek. I asked Anciso if she had a roommate and
               she said no. I asked Anciso if she could call someone to come
               help her and she said she could. I asked Anciso several times
               to call someone, but she made no attempt. Anciso's hair was
               mostly covered in vomit and she had it on her legs and shoes.
               Anciso was not able to lift her head to talk. I asked for
               Medics to respond for a detox. Ofc. Westerman and I attempted
               to help Anciso walk, but she was non load bearing and wouldn't
               attempt to walk. We set her back down. Medics arrived on scene
               and transported Anciso to PRH for a detox. Nothing further. I

               Exhibiting 2. NARRATIVE: On 10/30/15 at approximately 0108
               hours I was driving westbound on Cougar Way near the Soccer
               Field when I noticed a male, later identified as Brayde Joseph
               Hunter 09/15/96, stumbling side to side as he walked eastbound
               on Cougar Way along the soccer field. As I passed Hunter, I
               noticed he appeared to be under the age of 21. I turned around
               to go contact Hunter. While driving behind Hunter, I watched as
               he stumbled into the metal fence that he was walking along and
               then stumble to the other edge of the sidewalk. Hunter was
               stumbling so severely that he was taking up the whole sidewalk
               width. I passed Hunter and parked in between the soccer field
               and Global Scholars Hall. As I started to walk up to Hunter, he
               stopped against the fence and began to unbutton his pants.
               Recognizing that Hunter was about to urinate in public I told
               Hunter not to do that. Hunter did up his pants and I asked
               Hunter if he had his ID with him. Hunter said yes and began
               feeling around his pockets. Hunter realized he did not have his
               license and then said, "I do not have my ID with me but I know
               I'm 21 years of age." Hunter provided his name and date of
               birth verbally. Hunter identified himself as 19 years old. I
               asked Hunter why he just told me that he was 21 years old and
               Hunter said that he was just trying to get home. I asked Hunter
               if I could look at his eyes and he said I could. I told Hunter
               to stand with his heels and toes together and to follow the tip
               of my pen with his eyes only. As soon as I moved my pen Hunter
               moved his head to follow the pen. During the test I observed
               equal tracking, lack of smooth pursuit, and distinct and
               sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes. Hunter
               was swaying in all directions during the test. I could smell
               the odor of intoxicants coming from Hunter's breath as he stood
               before me. I asked Hunter how much he had to drink and he said
               just one beer. I told Hunter that he was not being honest with
               me and Hunter stuck to his story of just one beer. I asked
               Hunter if he would be willing to provide a voluntary PBT sample
               and Hunter said he would. I found my PBT (Alco-Sensor FST
               #16805) in working condition. Hunter provided a PBT sample of
               .184. I told Hunter that he was under arrest for MIP Exhibiting
               and handcuffed (D/L) him. I advised Hunter that he was being
               audio and video recorded and walked him over to my patrol car.

               Hunter was searched incident to arrest and no weapons or
               illegal items were located. I told Hunter that I would be
               forwarding charges of MIP Exhibiting to the prosecutor and
               explained the process. While talking with Hunter more I learned
               that he is not a WSU student and visiting his friend, Cory Alan
               Salander 12/04/96, who lives in Global Scholars Hall. I was
               able to locate a phone number for Salander and called him. On
               the second try Salander answered and I explained the situation.
               Salander said he would be right over. Once Salander arrived I
               told Hunter that he needed to go with Salander and not come
               back outside tonight or he could be rearrested. Hunter said he
               understood and left. Charges of MIP Exhibiting will be
               forwarded to the prosecutor. END OF REPORT I certify and

               10/30/15 at approximately 0146 hours I was driving northbound
               on Library Road approaching Bryan Hall when I noticed three
               females near the entrance of Bryan Hall. One female, later
               identified as Courtney Lynn Boucher 03/26/97, was sitting on
               the ground with her legs out in front of her. Boucher's back
               was to me. As I neared the three, the other two female tried
               quickly pick up Boucher. When they picked up Boucher I noticed
               Boucher's black thong style underwear were around her knees and
               she quickly pulled them up. I pulled along side the three and
               noticed a large wet spot on the concrete where Boucher had been
               sitting. It was clear that Boucher had just intentionally
               urinated in public. I told Boucher I needed to talk to her.
               Boucher appeared to be well under the age of 21. I told Boucher
               to walk with me and we walked back towards the puddle. There
               were several wet footprint steps where Boucher had stepped in
               her urine. I asked Boucher what the puddle was from and Boucher
               said she did not know. I asked Boucher how old she was and she
               told me 18 years old. Boucher provided her name and date of
               birth verbally and Ofc. Whitman ran it thought dispatch. Up to
               this point one of Boucher's friends had been holding her up by
               her arm. I asked Boucher if she could stand on her own and
               Boucher friend let go of her. I asked if I could look at
               Boucher's eyes and she said I could. I told Boucher to stand
               with her heels and toes together while keeping her arms at her
               sides. As soon and Boucher put her feet together she lost her
               balance and stumbled backwards. Once settled I told Boucher to
               follow the tip of my pen with her eyes only while keeping her
               head still. During the test I observed, equal tracking, lack of
               smooth pursuit, and distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum
               deviation in both eyes. During the test Boucher was swaying in
               all directions. I could smell the odor of intoxicants coming
               from Boucher's breath as she stood before me. I asked Boucher
               if she was willing to provide a voluntary PBT sample. Boucher
               said she would. I found my PBT (Alco-Sensor FST #16805) in
               working condition. Boucher provided a PBT sample of .206. I
               told Boucher that she was under arrest for MIP Exhibiting and
               advised her she was being audio and video recorded. I began to
               read Boucher her Miranda Rights when Boucher began to vomit.

               Boucher vomited pure liquid and it was evident that she had not
               ate anything recently. I read Boucher her Miranda Rights and
               she stated she understood. Boucher told me she is living in
               Lewiston, ID and her friends were going to take her home. I
               confirmed with Boucher's friend that they were indeed going to
               drive her home. I filled out a sector citation for urinating in
               public and issued it to Boucher. I explained that I would be

               Cited/Released Fail to transfer 5Z1099084 title 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 10/30/15 at approximately 0208 hours I was traveling
               eastbound on Cougar Way near the Old Bookie when I noticed a
               red VW Passat heading westbound on Cougar Way towards me. The
               VW appeared to be traveling faster than the posted 20 MPH zone.
               I activated my in car radar (vehicle 4) and obtained a reading
               of 31 MPH. When the VW passed me I turned around to initiate a
               traffic stop. Once we reached a safe location I stopped the
               car. I contacted the driver, Isaac Gitau Kuria 12/21/96,
               identified myself, informed the driver I was recording, and
               explained the reason for the stop. I asked for Kuria's driver's
               license which he provided. I asked for Kuria's vehicle
               registration and insurance and Kuria said he had just bought
               the car in Tacoma, WA. I asked Kuria if he had any paperwork
               and Kuria handed me a registration that did not have his name
               on it. I returned to my patrol car and ran Kuria and the
               vehicle through my MDC. Kuria's driver's license was valid but
               the vehicle registration stated the car had been sold on
               08/30/15 which is 61 days without the car being registered. I
               filled out a sector citation for failure to register vehicle
               within 45 days and returned to Kuria. I asked Kuria why he had
               not registered his car and Kuria said he did not have the money
               to do so. I explained that Kuria was technically under arrest
               however I was not going to handcuff him or take him out of the
               car. I explained the citation to Kuria and provided him with
               his copy. I told Kuria that if he was found driving the car
               again without registering it he could be arrested again. Kuria
               stated he understood. END OF REPORT I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 30th day of

               talking on his cell phone while driving on Cougar Way in the

               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Jesse W. Layne/03-20-96 Cited and Released
               Minor DUI 10153 2. NARRATIVE: On 10-30-15 at approximately 0205
               hours I was on patrol in the area of Cougar Way. I was
               traveling westbound on Cougar Way in my patrol vehicle when a
               green, 2002 Kia Optima (WA Lic. 406ZEL) that was in front of me
               drove by Sgt. Kuhrt on a nearby traffic stop. Sgt. Kuhrt had a
               vehicle pulled over on Cougar Way near the Lower Soccer Field.
               Sgt. Kuhrt was out of his vehicle when the Kia drove by him. As
               soon as I got up to Sgt. Kuhrt he advised me the driver of the
               Kia was talking on his cell phone and holding it up to his ear.
               I observed the vehicle make a left hand turn into the Smith Gym
               parking lot, and then began to travel eastbound on Cougar Way.
               I got behind the Kia and activated my emergency lights, and the
               vehicle came to stop in the parking lot next to Northside
               Residence Hall just off of Cougar Way. I stopped the vehicle
               for the above mentioned traffic violation. I contacted the
               driver of the vehicle, who was later identified as Jesse W.
               Layne (DOB 03-20-96). I advised him I was audio and video
               recording. I told Layne the reason for the traffic stop was
               because when he drove by the other officer on the traffic stop
               he could see him holding his cell phone up to his ear. Layne
               only had his window rolled down a third of the way and he was
               chewing mint gum. However, I could still smell the strong odor
               of intoxicants coming from the vehicle. Layne did not say
               anything in his response. However, a male in the backseat spoke
               up and said they were lost and trying to locate one of their
               friend's and that is the reason Layne was speaking on his cell
               phone. I asked to see his driver's license, vehicle
               registration, and proof of insurance. As Layne began to hand me
               his driver's license he hit his hand into the window with it
               before eventually raising it higher to clear the window. I
               asked Layne where they were coming from, and he said Cheney.
               Layne was able to find valid proof of insurance, but he was
               unable to find his vehicle registration. He slowly flipped
               through multiple papers from his glove box, but he was unable
               to find the registration. Again I asked Layne where he said
               they were coming from, and he replied Cheney again. I told him
               I was wondering what they had been up to in Pullman. Layne told

               me they were hanging out with friends in one of the
               fraternities. Layne was wearing a blue wristband on his right
               wrist. I asked him where he got it at, and he told me at the
               fraternity they were at earlier. I asked Layne if he had
               anything to drink tonight, and he said no. I could smell the
               medium odor of intoxicants coming from his breath. Sgt. Kuhrt
               arrived on scene as backup officer. I asked Layne if I could
               check his eye's, and he said yes. I checked his eyes for lack
               of smooth pursuit and distinct and sustained nystagmus at
               maximum deviation. I saw both lack of smooth pursuit in his
               left and right eye. I also saw distinct and sustained nystagmus
               at maximum deviation in both of his eye's. After checking his
               eye's I told Layne I know he told me he had nothing to drink,
               but I asked him if he wanted to be a little more honest with
               me. Layne then told me he had something to drink earlier. I
               asked Layne to step out of the vehicle so I could try and
               separate the odor of intoxicants from the vehicle and him.
               Layne stepped out of his vehicle. I could still smell the
               medium odor of intoxicants coming from Layne's breath. I asked
               Layne how old he was, and he said 19. I reminded Layne I was
               audio and video recording. I asked Layne if he would be willing
               to take some voluntary field sobriety tests, and he replied
               "yes sir". I told Layne I would be evaluating him on how well
               he performed the tests and on how well he followed my
               instructions. I asked him if he understood, and he said yes.
               The first test I administered was the HGN. I told Layne to
               stand with his feet together and his arms at his sides. I asked
               him if he was sick or injured, and he said no. I asked him if
               he was under the care of a doctor, and he said no. I told Layne
               to follow the tip of my pen with his eyes only. I told him to
               keep his head still. I asked him if he understood, and he said
               yes. I held my pen approximately 12-15 inches in front of
               Layne's face and administered the test. I checked Layne's eyes
               and noticed they tracked equally and his pupils were equal in
               size. I did not see resting nystagmus in either eye. I saw a
               lack of smooth pursuit in both of his eye's. I did not see
               distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation in either
               eye. I did not see onset of nystagmus prior to 45 degrees in
               either eye. I did not see any vertical nystagmus in either eye.
               The next test I administered was the walk and turn. I told
               Layne I wanted him to pretend there was an imaginary straight
               line out in front of him. I told him to place his left foot on
               that imaginary straight line. I told Layne to put his right
               foot in front of his left foot, with the heel of his right foot
               touching the toes of his left foot. I told him to stay in that
               position while I explained the test, and he said he understood.
               I told Layne to take nine heel to toe steps down the line and
               to take nine heel to toe steps back. I demonstrated three heel
               to toe steps for Layne. I told him once he gets to his last
               step to keep his lead foot planted on the ground, and take a
               series of small steps with his other foot. I demonstrated the
               turn and three more heel to toe steps for Layne. I told Layne
               to watch his feet as he walked, count his steps out loud, keep
               his arms at his sides, and not to stop walking until he
               completes the test. I asked him if he had any questions, and he

               said no. He told me he understood the test. I told Layne to
               begin the test. Instruction Phase: I did not observe any clues.
               First Nine Steps: Layne missed heel to toe on his first step.
               Turn: I did not observe any clues. Second Nine Steps: I did not
               observe any clues. The next test I administered was the one leg
               stand. As I began to explain the test a vehicle was pulling
               into a nearby parking space. I had Layne move to another
               location to be out of the way of any moving vehicles. Once we
               got to a different spot in the parking lot I restarted the
               instructions for him. I told Layne when I tell him to begin, to
               raise either leg of his choice approximately 6 inches off the
               ground. I told him to point his toe to keep his foot parallel
               to the ground. I was demonstrating the test to Layne as I was
               explaining the instructions. I told him once I tell him to
               begin to keep his foot parallel to the ground. I told Layne to
               count out loud by 1000's until I tell him to stop. I told him
               to look at his raised foot, keep his arms by his side, and I
               reminded him to not stop counting until I tell him to stop. I
               asked him what leg he was going to raise, and he told me his
               left. I asked him if he was ready, and he said "yes sir". I
               told him he may begin. Layne got to a count of one thousand
               twenty-one after 30 seconds had elapsed. I did not observe any
               clues. I told Layne the next test was a voluntary preliminary
               breath test (PBT). I told Layne the PBT does not replace the
               evidentiary breath test. I checked the PBT (Alco Sensor FST
               #102460) and found it working properly. Layne provided me with
               a breath sample of .077 at 0219 hours. I told Layne he was
               under arrest for Minor Operating a Motor Vehicle After
               Consuming Alcohol. I handcuffed Layne (double locked) and
               searched him incident to arrest, finding no items of
               evidentiary value or weapons. I read him his Constitutional
               Rights from my department issued Miranda Warning card. I asked
               Layne if he understood his rights, and said "yes sir". I asked
               if he would be willing to speak with us now, and he said "if
               you have questions I will answer them". I placed him in the
               back of my patrol vehicle. Sgt. Kuhrt explained to Layne's
               passengers that he was being arrested. None of the passengers
               were sober so Sgt. Kuhrt received permission from Layne to park
               his vehicle for him. I began transporting Layne to Pullman
               Police Department for the breath test. I asked Layne how much
               he had to drink tonight and he said probably four beers. Layne
               told me he started drinking at 2230 hours, and he drank one
               right after the other. He told me he was drinking Keystone
               Light. At approximately 0240 hours I directed Layne to the
               interview room so he could speak with an attorney. I called
               John Snyder on the phone and advised him I arrested Layne for
               Minor Operating a Motor Vehicle after Consuming Alcohol. I left
               the interview room while Layne spoke with Snyder. I read Layne
               his Constitutional Rights at about 0248 hours. Layne said he
               understood his rights and signed both signature blocks. I
               checked Layne's mouth at 0252 hours, finding no foreign
               substance. I read Layne his Implied Consent Warning for Breath
               at 0251 hours. Layne signed that it was read to him. I asked
               Layne if he would submit to a breath test, and he said yes. He
               checked the yes box and initialed next to it. Layne provided a

               breath sample of .059 (IR) / .061 (EC) at 0315 hours and a
               sample of .055 (IR) / .056 (EC) at 0318 hours. The breath test
               was administered in accordance to the methods approved by the
               Washington State Toxicologist pursuant to the Washington
               Administrative Code. Layne was fingerprinted and photographed.
               I issued Layne criminal citation #10153 for Minor Operating a
               Motor Vehicle after Consuming Alcohol. I provided him with a
               copy of the driver's hearing request, and explained it to him.
               I provided him with his criminal citation. I explained all the
               forms to Layne, and returned all of his property to him. I
               later provided him with his notice of hearing/conditions of
               release and explained it to him. I provided Layne a courtesy
               transport back to the lot near Northside Residence Hall. I
               later downloaded the video footage from my Vievu camera to the
               permanent digital evidence folder. I later faxed the DUI report
               to the Washington Department of Licensing. Layne was polite and
               cooperative throughout our encounter. No further action at this
               time. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the
               laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 30th day of October, 2015, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer
