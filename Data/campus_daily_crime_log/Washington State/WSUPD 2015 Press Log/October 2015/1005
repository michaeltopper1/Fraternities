               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W4722 SYNOPSIS: A WSU employee reported

               Loaiza called dispatch stating someone spit on his vehicle on 2
               separate days while it was parked on the WSU campus. I
               contacted Loaiza and asked him to tell me about the incidents.
               He said he works on Dairy Road and has had to park his personal
               SUV (ID/iLC0243) on the roadway near the receiving and delivery
               roll up doors due to construction. He said he returned to his
               vehicle after work on 09-30-15 and realized someone had spit on
               his vehicle door. He said it was the front passenger door of
               the SUV. He thought someone must have made a mistake and just
               cleaned the door. On 10-02-15, he returned to his SUV after
               work to find someone had spit in the middle of his rear seat,
               passenger door. He now does not believe this is happening by
               mistake. Loaiza said he placed trail cameras on the dash of his
               SUV in hopes of catching the person who is spitting on his
               vehicle. I asked him to call me if he does catch an image of
               the person who is doing so. I gave Loaiza my name and phone
               number as well as his Police Case Number. Nothing further at
               this time. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 5th day of October, 2015, in Pullman,
