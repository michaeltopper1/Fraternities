    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC:MTK/336 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W4935 SYNOPSIS: Report of a car alarm
               sounding and a suspicious male nearby. Area checked, door found
               unsecured on a car. Door was secured and a male in the area was
               contacted. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 10/12/15 at approximately 2215 hours I was
               dispatched to a suspicious call in the blue lot off of Forest
               Way. The reporting party (anonymous) told Whitcom that a car
               alarm was sounding in the parking lot and when she drove by she
               saw a male subject hiding in the bushes. The subject was
               described as a male with a grey hoodie, shaggy hair, and a
               skateboard. WSUPD arrived in the area and I located a male
               subject in the middle of one of the tiers doing jumps on his
               skateboard. As I was nearing the subject, I heard a car alarm
               sound towards the top of the tiers. The male subject did not
               react to the sound and kept doing "ollies". Ofc. Boyd was at
               the car as the alarm was going off. I contacted the
               skateboarder and asked if he had been in the area a while. He
               said he had been around for about 20 minutes. I asked if he
               heard the alarm going off and he said that was the third time
               it went off. He said that alarm would sound every 7-10 minutes.
               I asked if he saw anyone suspicious in the area and he said no.
               The male was identified by WADL as Dax T. Buratto 05/17/97.
               Ofc. Boyd radioed that the door to the car appeared as if it
               hadn't completely latched. I asked him to secure the door and
               he closed it. Ofc. Boyd also noted that there was a club on the
               steering wheel. The vehicle or registered owner were not in
               locals to contact. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 13th day of
               October, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.
