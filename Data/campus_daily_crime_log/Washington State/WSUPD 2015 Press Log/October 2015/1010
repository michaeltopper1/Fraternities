    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Olmstead/339 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W4858 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched to a
               report of a parking problem. The WSU Cycling Club reported that
               a parked vehicle was in the way of a bicycling race course.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 10-10-
               2015 at about 0739 hrs I was dispatched to a report of a
               parking problem near the Outdoor Recreation Center, located at
               1110 NE North Fairway Road. I contacted the complainant, Lance
               D. Kidder (DOB 06-24-1993), on the telephone. Kidder is a
               member of the WSU Cycling Club. Kidder explained that the
               cycling club was hosting a mountain bike race today and a
               parked WSU vehicle was blocking a section of the race course. I
               learned that Officer Petlovany had also received a report of
               this situation yesterday. For more information see related case
               #15-W4844. I was not able to identify a WSU employee
               responsible for the vehicle. I told Kidder the vehicle would
               not be moved and suggested he reroute the event around the
               vehicle. No further action at this time. Olmstead/339 I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.

               WITNESS(ES): n/a NARRATIVE: On 10-10-2015 at about 1323 hrs I
               was dispatched to a non-injury vehicle collision in the "green"
               parking lot located on the south side of the Owen Science
               Library, 1255 NE College Avenue. I arrived on scene and
               contacted the following individuals: Milly Xun (DOB 07-18-1994)
               and Qiongqi Xiao (DOB 05-16-1987). Xun was the driver of a
               blue, 2009 Toyota Corolla (WA Lic. AHK9886). Xiao was the
               driver of a red, 2013 Toyota Corolla (WA Lic. ANY5539). There
               were no other passengers or witnesses. After speaking with Xun
               and Xiao, I determined the following: Xun and Xiao were both
               parked in the parking lot. Xun and Xiao both began backing out
               of their respective parking spaces at the same time. Xun and
               Xiao did not see each other and did not realize they were
               backing towards each other. They continued backing up, and the
               rear bumpers of both vehicles collided. Xun and Xiao did not
               complain of any injuries. The damage to the vehicles was
               consistent with the information provided by the drivers. The
               vehicles had been moved slightly before my arrival. I
               photographed the vehicles, and the photographs were downloaded
               into Spillman and attached to this case. I gave Xun and Xiao a
               verbal warning for unsafe backing. No further action at this
               time. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this __11__ day of

               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On October 10, 2015 at
               about 1522 hours Pullman Fire and WSU Police were dispatched to
               a suicidal female at Global Scholars 462. Pullman Fire was not
               able to respond as they had no available units/personnel.
               Whitman County District 12 responded as an agency assist. The
               complainant told Whitcom that she thinks her friend is trying
               to kill herself by overdosing on prescription medicine. The
               complainant has not had contact with the patient for a 20
               minutes. The patient has a history of suicide by taking pills.
               Officer Olmstead and I responded to Global Scholars 462. The
               door was open and only one (1) occupant in the room, Alexis M.
               Velasco-Coley (12/26/96). She was standing on the ladder to her
               bunk bed. Velasco-Coley did not seem surprised to see the
               police. She gave us permission to enter her room. As Velasco-
               Coley talked with me her speech sounded a little slurred. She
               admitted to taking an unknown quantity of propranolol, which is
               a beta blocker that is prescribed for heart and circulation
               issues. She said she took at least seven (7) pills. She lost
               count of how many she ingested. Velasco-Coley estimates that
               she took the pills at about 1515 hours. I asked her if she was
               trying to hurt herself. She began to cry, her head went down
               and she said "yes". Velasco-Coley told me she has anexiety,
               bipolar, depression and a myriad of other mental health related
               issues. She had about eight different prescriptions. Velasco-
               Coley claims that she only took the propranolol. Velasco-Coley
               told me she is having a difficult time adjusting to life at
               WSU. She said she has not felt this depressed since she was 14
               years old. She said she is seeing professionals at WSU
               Counseling Services as well as WSU Health & Wellness. Velasco-
               Coley has not told her family of her struggles since coming to
               school from Tacoma. Velasco-Coley was transported by Whitman
               County District 12 ambulance to Pullman Regional Hospital. I
               responded to the hospital where I turned Velasco-Coley over to
               hospital staff. I placed her into protective custody per RCW
               71.05.150 as I have reasonable cause to believe she is
               suffering from a mental disorder and presents an imminent
               likelihood of serious harm to herself. Doctor Lightfoot signed
               the form and I kept a copy for the file. I called the
               complainant, Jessie R. Koch (10/22/96) and spoke with her about
               the incident. No further investigation, case to be sent to WSU

               L. Clark (081493). NARRATIVE: On 101015 at approximately 1556
               hours I came on duty a little early as it seemed day shift was
               busy. Dispatch informed me that a hit and run had just occurred
               in the Olympia Ave Hall parking lot. The Ford (WA/ADM7301) had
               left the area with no known direction of travel. I responded to
               the lot and upon my arrival I found the suspect vehicle had
               returned. I contacted the driver, Madison L. Grimes (041297),
               who was visibly shaken. She admitted to hitting the vehicle and
               intentionally leaving as she had become so nervous and
               distraught. Her boyfriend, Patrick G. Schwartzkopf (093096),
               had convinced her to come back and leave a note. She had been
               backing out of a parking spot and struck a Subaru (WA/AHV3590).
               They had then left. She knew she had hit the vehicle. At this
               time the owner of the Subaru, Britteny L. Alspach (040489),
               arrived and confirmed that there was new and extensive damage
               to her vehicle. Both Alspach and Grimes provided me with the
               necessary information for me to create a Sector exchange of
               information. I spoke with Jordan D. Tootill (052394) who had
               witnessed the event. He was driving up to where the event
               occurred when he saw the Ford strike the Subaru. He was on the
               opposite side of the Ford from the unoccupied Subaru. I asked
               if the occupants of the Ford had gotten out of the vehicle and
               he said they had not. They appeared to wait to see what he was
               going to do and then the vehicle left. He was positive they
               were aware they had hit the vehicle. I took photos of both
               vehicles. I provided both parties with the Sector exchange of
               information and my business card. I informed Grimes I would be
               sending her to Student Conduct but not arresting her at the
               time though she had committed a Hit and Run. We all cleared.
               Nothing follows. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing

               Martin Stadium, but the two vehicles had been moved to the
               parking lot next to the Washington Building. Upon my arrival I
               contacted the drivers of the two vehicles a Julian Rodriguez
               and Dalton Davis. Both drivers said that Rodriguez had stopped
               at a crosswalk for pedestrians and Davis failed to stop in time
               and struck Rodriguez. There was a small amount of damage to
               both vehicles. Neither met the threshold requirements. Both had
               already exchanged information, but wanted to know what else to
               do. I told them I would take photos of the two vehicles , but
               other that calling their insurance agencies everything had been
               done. Both thanked me and left the area. I later downloaded the
               photos into spillman. I certify and declare under penalty of

               1. Mark E. Summers (091992) Cited/Conduct Obstruction 5Z0888932
               2. NARRATIVE: On 101015 at approximately 2302 hours I was at
               Dana Hall along Spokane St. putting a fence back up that had
               been blown down by the wind. This is the same area I commonly
               run radar on bike patrol. I heard a loud revving of an engine
               and saw a vehicle driving northbound toward me doing
               approximately 20 mph. I then saw a vehicle (WA/196YAM) approach
               from behind the lead vehcile. The second vehicle I saw was
               Ford. The Ford caught up to the vehicle in front of it as if it
               was standing still. The Ford appeared to be approaching 40 mph.
               The Ford came up so fast on the lead vehicle I thought it was
               going to pass it. Ofc. Tiengo was responding to help me with
               the fence so I asked him to stop the Ford. He did so at the
               Green Lot on Campus St. Once the fence was up I responded to
               Ofc. Tiengo's location. Ofc. Tiengo had stopped the vehicle at
               2302 hours and I arrived at 2307 hours. I spoke with the
               driver, Mark E. Summers (091992), and confirmed he had been
               told why he was stopped. I told him he was very close to be
               arrested for his driving. Once he began talking I could smell
               the odor of intoxicants coming from his breath, even in the
               substantial wind that was present. I noticed his eyes were
               glassy. I asked him if he would provide a breath sample for a
               PBT and he declined. He said he would just like to go home as
               he lived so close. I told him I believed he had been drinking
               and that his car should just be parked. He said he was going to
               drive. He then asked if he was free to go and I told him I was
               now conducting a DUI investigation. Summers then rolled up his
               window. I told him I could order him out of the vehicle and
               that if he did not he would be obstructing. I then said "sir
               step out of the vehicle and come talk to me". Summers said he
               was going to begin recording us, I informed him I already was.
               I then requested Sgt. Griffin to respond as it appeared we were
               going to have to extract Summers from the vehicle. Summers
               started stating he was just told he could leave. I did not say
               that nor did I hear Ofc. Tiengo say it. Summers began saying
               that since he had been at work at the Hilltop, where he cooks,
               that he could not have been drinking, and that I could check
               his schedule. I told him he was refusing a lawful order and he
               said it was not a lawful order. He asked if it was a lawful
               order because I was a Police Officer, I told him yes. I
               reiterate that he was detained for his driving, that I was

               telling him to get out of the vehicle, and that he was refusing
               to do that. He asked for proof of his bad driving. I asked what
               kind of proof he wanted and he stated again he wanted proof of
               his bad driving. I reminded him I had just asked what kind of
               proof he wanted. He said "any proof". I told him I felt he was
               driving poorly. I told him he could step out of the car and
               talk to me or he would end up in hotter water. He said he was
               not going to get out of the car and talk to me. I stated again
               that I was ordering him out of the vehicle. He asked under what
               grounds. I told him he was impeding the investigation and he
               asked what investigation. Summers was told the investigation
               was for DUI again. Summers commented that it "was a shame" he
               couldn't listen to music while he recorded us. Sgt. Griffin
               arrived and I told him what we had at that point, including
               that it appeared that Summers had locked his doors. Sgt.
               Griffin then spoke with Summers. Sgt. Griffin relayed that
               Summers was under arrest for Obstruction. Summers said he just
               did not want to get a ticket. I told him I was not planning on
               writing him a speeding ticket. He then started complaining that
               he had broken window and that his phone had a thumb print on
               it. Summers stated it was a shame it was so windy and that he
               could not record us. He told us it was for his safety and our
               safety, though he had been told several times we were
               recording. I then placed Summers under arrest for Obstruction,
               informed him we were being audio/visually recorded, and that he
               had the right to an attorney. He told me he did not plan on
               fighting out of his handcuffs. He was searched incident arrest
               by Intern Chase. I then read Summers his rights. He said he
               understood them. I then offered him a portable breath test and
               he declined. He was placed in the back of my patrol car while I
               completed Sector Citation #5Z0888932. I then explained the
               citation to him and I told him it would be sent to the address
               he had provided to me. He had to confirm with me what that
               address was that he had given me. He stated he hoped it did not
               have to miss class, it would be a shame. I told him he should
               not drive. He told us "thank you" and to have a "successful
               night". He told us he appreciates what we do. He then looked at
               his wallet and said he had had another id in it. He had
               forgotten that Ofc. Tiengo had given it back to him at his car
               and that is where he located it. We cleared. Nothing follows. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 11th day of October, 2015, in Pullman,

               NARRATIVE: On 10/10/15 at about 2332 hours I was dispatched to
               a drugs call at Gannon Hall room 225. The RED smelled the odor
               of marijuana coming from the room and there were 2 to 4 males
               inside of the room. I responded and talked to RED Joshua
               McPhatter who had called in the report. He said no one had left
               the room since he had called. I smelled around the door jam of
               room 225 and could smell the odor of marijuana. I knocked on
               the door and could hear someone inside opening and closing
               drawers. A male answered the door after a few moments. I asked
               both males in the room to step out into the hallway. Faisal M.
               Almadi and Abdulaziz K. Al-Dossary stepped out. I explained I
               was there because of a report of the odor of marijuana. I asked
               how old they were, they were both under 21. I asked if either
               had a medical marijuana card, they both stated they did not.
               Almadi stated that he was at a party and had smoke marijuana.
               He also said he had marijuana in the room. Al-Dossary stated he
               had just come by to wait for a ride and had not smoked any
               marijuana. Almadi also stated that Al-Dossary had not smoked.
               Almadi went back into his room and brought out a small baggy of
               marijuana. I escorted him to a trash can outside where he
               destroyed the marijuana and threw it in the trash. I explained
               to Almadi I was warning him and my report would be forwarded to
               student conduct. Nothing further. I certify and declare under

               but breathing normally. Ofc. Whitman and I arrived scene. We
               went to the bathroom between room 169 and 170. We could see a
               male passed out on the floor inside one of the stalls. However,
               the door to the stall was locked. Ofc. Whitman got on his back
               and slide underneath the stall to unlock the door. The male was
               unable to answer our questions, and was vomiting. The male
               eventually opened his eyes and began mumbling words. He was
               able to sit up with the support of Ofc. Whitman. There was a
               driver's license in his wallet that was next to him on the
               floor. He was identified as Marcus E. Neal (DOB 07-27-97).
               Pullman medics soon arrived on scene. They transported Neal to
               Pullman Regional Hospital for alcohol detox. We cleared the
               scene. No further action. I certify and declare under penalty

               on metal door hinge in Northside Residence Hall. Officers
               requested medics. Pullman medics arrived on scene and checked
               out patient. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 10-11-15 at approximately 0210 hours Ofc. Whitman
               and I were at Northside Residence Hall for a medical call,
               located at 1590 NE Cougar Way. We got on the elevator to clear
               the call. As soon as we got on the elevator there was a male
               with a white paper towel around his thumb, and blood on his
               pants. The male was later identified as Dray C. White (DOB 10-
               13-96). White said he saw the lights outside the window and
               thought we could help. We got down to the main lobby and had
               White sit down in a chair. White showed me his thumb and had a
               small laceration on it. He told me he was riding one of those
               electric scooters with no handles on the fourth floor hallway.
               White said he lost his balance and caught his thumb on a nearby
               metal door hinge when he began to fall. Pullman medics were
               already at Northside, so it just took them a couple minutes to
               respond. Pullman medics arrived and checked out White. Ofc.
               Whitman and I cleared the scene. No further action. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.
