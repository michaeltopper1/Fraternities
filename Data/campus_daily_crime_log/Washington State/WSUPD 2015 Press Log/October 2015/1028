               regarding statements written on a chalkboard. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 10-28-15 at about 0827
               hours I was dispatched to the report of a suspicious
               circumstance. Whitcom advised that Brian Rawlings was
               requesting phone contact regarding statements written on a
               chalkboard at Duncan Dunn. I was told that Rawlings has a
               daughter that is a student at WSU and she lives in Wilmer Davis
               Hall. I called Rawlings at the number provided and asked how I
               could help him. He told me the following; he said that his
               daughter lives in Wilmer Davis Hall and has friends that live
               in Duncan Dunn. He said that his daughter will go to Duncan
               Dunn to hang out with her friends, and while she was there she
               saw some "disturbing messages" written on the chalkboard
               attached to a resident's door. Rawlings went on to explain that
               this is the "same guy that was carrying a knife around the hall
               a few weeks ago". Rawlings said he does not know who lives in
               the room but is "sure" that we do. I explained to Rawlings that
               the subject seen carrying a knife around was actually never
               identified, and that there have been rumors that it is a
               particular resident but that was never confirmed. I asked him
               what the chalkboard said. He told me that there was Chinese
               symbols, the words "destruction of innocence" and "other stuff
               like that". Rawlings said he had a picture that his daughter
               sent him, which he later sent to me. Rawlings said he told his
               daughter to "stay the hell outta there". I explained to
               Rawlings that if his daughter ever feels unsafe she should call
               the police. I told him that at this point, the resident is
               expressing their freedom of speech and that there have not been
               any other complaints about what is on his door. Rawlings said
               he understood but wanted us to be aware because it seems like
               "the kid is walking a fine line". I again told Rawlings that if
               his daughter ever felt unsafe, scared, threatened or harassed
               that she should call the police. Rawlings said he understood. I
               ended my conversation with him. Rawlings did not identify his
               daughter or the friends she hangs out with in Duncan Dunn. I
               later received an email from Rawlings with the picture of the
               resident's door. I recognize the writing to be that of Justin
               Lam Po Tang. At this point there have not been any other
               complaints about the writing and I did not see anything that
               could be considered as threatening or inappropriate.
               Information documented. Nothing further. I certify and declare

               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: Wade
               Brantner reported about two weeks ago he noticed a small
               portion, about a two foot strip, of fence behind the University
               Stores building had been cut open. He was reporting it now
               because someone else had recently noticed it which reminded him
               it needed to be reported. Brantner had no idea how long it had
               been this way, but believed at least a couple of months.
               Brantner said they took an inventory of what is stored inside
               the fenced area, and as far as they could tell nothing was
               missing. Brantner and I walked a portion of the fence and did
               not find anything else that was not explainable. The area right
               around the cut portion appeared as if it had not been disturbed
               for quite some time. Pictures were taken. I asked Brantner to
               let me know if they find any additional damaged areas and/or
               items that are missing. No suspects, no leads, no further at
               this time. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under

               Services was requesting a welfare check on a child in a
               wheelchair that had been left unattended for the last fifteen
               minutes. Orcutt provided a license plate of F319WSU and said
               the vehicle was parked in a disable parking stall east of
               Lighty. I responded and Orcutt showed me to the van. I looked
               inside and saw an adult male sleeping in his wheelchair. I
               knocked on the door and he woke up. He opened the door for me.
               The male, only identified as Sean, said he was taking a nap
               during his lunch break and that everything was fine. I thanked

               sitting on the ground next to Engineering Teaching Resource
               Lab. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: The
               black backpack with wires and a beeping noise coming from it
               belonged to ELM Locate and Utilities Services. The backpack was
               being picked up as I arrived on scene. The individual, who was
               not identified, said he was doing a lot of mapping in the area.
               The vehicle he was driving had the company name on it's sides,
               and the License plate, ID/FL2552, came back to the same
               company. The backpack contained locating equipment which is
               connected to certain underground piping, and also grounded
               (explaining the wires coming out of the backpack), which aids
               in his mapping of underground utilities. So, it is
               understandable why this would look suspicious to someone, but
               actually isn't. No further at this time. I certify and declare

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: JAK/333 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5347 SYNOPSIS: A WSU student reported a
               suspicious male who was mumbling to himself about how he was
               going to get home to Colfax. The male was identified as a
               person with developmental delays, who is a dishwasher for WSU.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 10-28-
               15, at approximately 1415 hours, Katherine A.J. Lomeli (07-15-
               94) called Whitcom concerned about a suspicious male near the
               area of Wilmer/Davis Hall. She said the male was older, was
               wearing a black wind breaker over a gray shirt, pants, carrying
               a Dissmores grocery bag, and having a red lanyard around his
               neck. She said the male was walking around mumbling to himself.
               She said the male was mumbling something about having to get
               home to Colfax. Corporal Edwards and I responded to the area
               and located the male. Upon our arrival, I observed the male had
               the zipper to his pants unzipped. I asked him if he had any
               identification and he said he does not drive. I could see a
               "Cougar Card" in his lanyard so I asked if I could see it. It
               identified him as Paul Daniel McDonald (01-02-55). Whitcom
               stated he was in locals and had been contacted due to
               suspicious circumstances in Colfax a few times. McDonald told
               Edwards he was waiting for the bus to pick him up. He told her
               he washes dishes in the Northside Cafe and gets off from work
               at 1430 hours each day. He told her the bus then comes to pick
               him up. I asked Whitcom to contact "Dial-a-Ride" from Pullman
               Transit to see if they usually pick McDonald up. At this time
               "Dial-a-Ride" arrived on scene. We thanked McDonald for his
               cooperation as he got on the "Dial-a-Ride" bus and we cleared.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 28th day of October, 2015, in
               Pullman, Washington. _______________________________________

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5349 SYNOPSIS: Report of a vehicle
               prowl. No suspects or leads. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 10-28-15 at approximately 1600
               hours, I contacted Joel Ragazzo in the Blue 1 Lot near the
               lowest southeast corner. Joel advised me someone had broken
               into his vehicle and torn it apart. He began to show me the
               vehicle and I could clearly see the damage done. They had put
               the vehicle up on a jack and stolen the rear passenger tire.
               Joel stated it was the only tire which did not have a locking
               lug nut. They left the lug nuts. On the rear of the vehicle, I
               could see fresh marks from a pry tool. It appeared they had
               tried to pry the trunk open. Joel advised me the only way to
               open the trunk is by key. They had also broken the key lock and
               he was unable to open it. A backup camera which had been at the
               top of the rear license plate had been cut off and stolen. In
               the rear seat of the vehicle, they had stolen the upper portion
               of the driver's side rear seat which allowed them access to the
               trunk area. In the trunk was a subwoofer box which contained an
               amplifier. Joel stated he had the box built in a way it is only
               able to be removed through the open trunk and not through the
               vehicle's back seat. It appeared they had attempted to remove
               it, but had been unsuccessful. There were wires cut through out
               the vehicle. In the front passenger side they had torn apart
               the glove box and dashboard. It appeared they may have been
               looking for the ECU which is actually in the engine compartment
               and had not been taken. In the center of the dashboard, they
               stole the stereo, ripping apart the dash to take it and cutting
               all of the wires. They also stole the receiver for the backup
               camera. They ripped apart the area in the ceiling which had the
               reading lamps and where the rear view mirror had been attached.
               The mirror was found on the driver's side floorboard. On the
               driver's side, they had torn apart the dash around the steering
               wheel, and it appeared they may have been trying to hot wire
               the car. Joel stated he had installed a push start on the
               vehicle which had disabled the key start for the vehicle. The
               door tracks on the floorboard had also been ripped out and
               numerous wires had been cut. Joel stated he didn't have
               insurance on the vehicle. He stated he had not been able to
               afford driving the vehicle and was in the process of trying to
               sell the vehicle. I asked Joel if he had anyone in his life who
               was mad at him and he said no. I asked if he was involved in
               any sort of criminal issues like drugs. Joel stated he had a
               green card for medical marijuana. I asked how many people knew

               about this and he said two. He stated neither of them would
               have done anything like this. I took video of the damage to the
               vehicle which I downloaded to the S: drive. I provided him with
               my business card with the case number. I asked him to take a
               very detailed inventory of the vehicle and make a list for me
               of what was damaged and missing. I asked him to try and find
               serial numbers, make, and model of those items and he stated he
               would. The vehicle had items strewn throughout it and Joel
               stated it had been messy before, but nothing like it was now. I
               looked at the areas which appeared to have been touched by the
               suspect(s) to get fingerprints, and the dashboard area had a
               textured pattern which would not allow for me to dust for
               prints. The areas on the trunk were smooth and appeared very
               smeared. I explained this to Joel and he stated he understood.
               I asked Joel when he last saw his vehicle undamaged and he
               stated around 1000 hours on 10-26-15. He said he had just seen
               a grounds maintenance worker drive through who stopped and
               talked to him. The worker had stated he saw the vehicle on the
               jack on Tuesday. Joel did not have the name of the employee. I
               have sent an email to grounds supervisor to see if we can
               identify the employee. Waiting on email of all items taken and
               damaged from Joel. No leads, no suspects. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               28th day of October, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: mjp/327 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5350 SYNOPSIS: 2 $20 bills were used at
               the Bookie over more than a 24 hour period. No significant
               information at this time. I left a message with the Secret
               Service. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 102815 at approximately 1628 hours I was dispatched to the
               report of a Fraud at the Bookie in the CUB. I responded and met
               with Carolina N. Calvin (040794) the Finance Manager of the
               Bookie. She told me the following. On 102715 at an unknown time
               the Bookie accepted a $20 bill that they believe to have been
               counterfeit. They were not sure which employee had received the
               money but knew it came from the main registers on the 1st
               floor. On 102815 at before 1245 hours the Bookie accepted
               another $20 bill that they believed to be counterfeit. They had
               taken both bills to the Sun Trust Branch where employee Ben
               Gecas felt that they were counterfeit too. The bills would not
               create a distinctive marking with the pens. The second bill was
               received at register #14 at the main area on the 1st floor.
               This is the same location as the 1st bill. Register #14 is the
               second from the right as you look at them from the customer's
               perspective. The register was run by a Tanner E. Riles
               (091790). I located him in Spillman based on his phone number.
               The last 7 numbers matched. I got 509-961-5888 from the Bookie.
               Riles apparently had worked the some location the day before
               from 0900 to 1400 hours. Calvin had no reason to suspect Riles
               being involved. She has worked at the Bookie for approximately
               3 years and has not encountered this issue. I asked about video
               and specific transactions. She said they had already gone
               through all of their surveillance video and had screen shots of
               each person based off of cash transactions for purchases under
               $20 and $40. She agreed to email me that information along with
               the transaction information. In general nothing suspicious had
               been raised by any customer. Calvin said there had not been any
               issues with Riles and she did not suspect him of being part of
               the issue. I seized the bills and later placed them into
               evidence. Calvin was provided with my business card for her to
               email me the information I requested. I placed a call to the
               Secret Service in Spokane and left a message. Case pending
               further developments. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 28th day of October,

               (04/22/97), had been causing issues with some residents. She
               went on to tell me he has a history of causing trouble and had
               done some things earlier which she believed rose to the level
               of harassment and caused her some concern. At this point she
               told me she would let one of the two occupants of the room
               explain what had happened. At this point Marina E Pappas
               (03/26/97) began to explain what had happened and told me the
               following. Pappas began to explain things had started as a
               result of an instagram message from Townsend to a girl, whom
               she would not identify. She went on to tell me Townsend had
               used harsh language towards this girl and when asked what he
               had said she told me he had called the other girl "crazy."
               Pappas told me she took offense to this because the girl liked
               him and went to Townsend's room on the 12th floor. Once at his
               room Pappas was invited into the room along with another girl,
               who was not named. Pappas began to address Townsend and asked
               him why he would refer to the other girl as crazy, when she
               liked him anyway. She continued and told me sometime after this
               the argument continued and she eventually hit him in the arm at
               least twice with a roll of paper towels she had been holding.
               The argument continued to escalate at which point Townsend's
               friend, later identified as Jacob P Bertram (06/22/97),
               returned and pushed his way into the room. At this point the
               second female with Pappas stumbled into the closet while
               Bertram tried to push both females out of the room while
               telling everyone to calm down. At this point Marsh began to
               interject herself into the conversation and asked to move the
               conversation to a different location. I continued speaking to
               Pappas and began to explain to her Townsend's use of the word
               "Crazy" to describe someone was not a crime. I continued and

               went onto explain what she had done by striking Townsend with
               the paper roll could technically be considered an assault. At
               this point Marsh began to speak again and began to tell me
               about another incident where a female may have been assaulted
               by Townsend. This female did not want to speak with law
               enforcement and Pappas began to relate the events surrounding
               this incident. She went on to explain the female, whom she
               would not identify, had been concerned about Townsend. This
               female asked Pappas to hide in her closet while Townsend came
               to the room. Upon his arrival Townsend attempted to kiss the
               female and was told no at least twice before Pappas hit the
               wall with a shoe. She eventually exited the closet and after a
               short period of time Townsend left the area. I asked who the
               female was, and Pappas told me she didn't want to tell me,
               adding she didn't want to be involved. As I began to explain if
               this were true I would need to speak with her to obtain her
               side of the story, Marsh again interjected herself and asked to
               speak with me outside. Ofc Tiengo arrived around this point and
               I told Marsh that would be fine and asked Tiengo to speak with
               Pappas. After leaving the room Marsh and I moved to the 13th
               floor lounge where I explained what I was trying to obtain from
               Pappas and why. We continued to speak regarding this incident
               and she told me there was a history of issues with Townsend
               dating back to the beginning of the school year. When I asked
               if they had been documented and sent to student conduct I
               learned Tiengo had asked her the same question during a recent
               investigation. As we continued to speak Tiengo entered the room
               and later confirmed the incidents Marsh had raised were the
               same ones, with the exception of an incident which occurred on
               Monday during a pumpkin carving party. During this incident
               Townsend had showed up and was carving a pumpkin with a pick
               axe before later striking it in the direction of other
               students. Around this point the 12th floor Resident Advisor,
               later identified as Riley T Huot (02/04/96), arrived. We
               continued to speak for some time before Tiengo and I went to
               the 12th floor to speak with Townsend, whom was walking down
               the hallway as we approached. We asked if we could speak inside
               and were told that would be fine. Once inside of the room I saw
               Townsend pull his phone out of his pocket and noticed a
               notification from Pappas on his phone. After looking at his
               phone he placed it back in his pocket before continuing to
               speak with Tiengo. As we were continuing to speak Townsend
               mentioned his phone to Tiengo at which point I asked him if he
               would pull it out of his pocket. During the conversation with
               Pappas and Marsh, I was told Townsend at some point had allowed
               an unidentified female to get ahold of his phone which had some
               text messages from another female. This caused an argument
               between Townsend and this unidentified female. Once Townsend
               pulled the phone out I noticed the screen was not locked....

               Petlovany radioed me to see if I could respond to his location.
               I had heard Ofc. Petlovany call out on a traffic stop a few
               minutes ago on NE N. Fairway Rd. near Beasley Coliseum. My
               Vievu camera was left at the department because I was
               downloading videos. Ofc. Petlovany let me borrow his. I
               responded to his location. He had a silver, 2007 Nissan truck
               (CA Lic. 8M44679) pulled over. Ofc. Petlovany was talking with
               the driver, who was later identified as Robert M. Frisch (DOB
               03-01-96). Once Ofc. Petlovany finished speaking with Frisch,
               he walked back to me to tell me what was going on. He told me
               he stopped his vehicle because his headlights were not turned
               on. Ofc. Petlovany told me Frisch was not making any sense when
               he initially contacted him. He said "spanish" and then
               mentioned something about have California plates. Ofc.
               Petlovany told me he was under the age of 21 and there is the
               odor of alcohol coming from him. See Ofc. Petlovany's
               supplemental report for more details about the traffic stop. I
               walked up to the driver's side door of the vehicle and
               contacted Frisch. Frisch was wearing a referee type costume as
               if he were coming from a party. I asked Frisch if he would be
               willing to take some voluntary field sobriety tests. Frisch
               replied he would like to speak to his attorney before he did
               that. I could smell the strong odor of intoxicants coming from
               Frisch's breath. His eyes were very watery as well. Ofc.
               Petlovany told Frisch to step out of the vehicle. Again Frisch
               said that he wanted to speak to his attorney, who happens to be
               his father. Petlovany told him not right now. Ofc. Petlovany
               again asked Frisch he needed to step out of the vehicle, and
               Frisch said he would not do that. Frisch continued to argue
               with us, and he said "I know I do not voluntarily have to step
               out of the vehicle". Frisch asked if he was under arrest. I
               told Frisch he would be under arrest if he does not comply and
               step out of the vehicle, and he asked me if that was a threat.
               Ofc. Petlovany asked Frisch how much he had to drink, and he

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
               replied nothing. I told Frisch multiple times again that he
               needed to step out of the vehicle or be subject to arrest for
               obstruction. Frisch continued to argue and told me his father
               is a lawyer, and he does not need to get out of the vehicle
               when an officer instructs him to do so. Frisch had paperwork in
               his hand and he was slowly trying to put it back in his glove
               box. His movements were very slow and deliberate while he was
               doing this. Frisch had the paperwork all the way in the glove
               box, but he kept his arm there and was not moving it. The
               female passenger took the papers from him and she told Frisch
               she would take care of it. I kept telling Frisch to get out of
               the car. He again told me he is not legally required to get out
               of the car. Ofc. Petlovany told Frisch he is because of case
               law State v. Kennedy. Frisch began to argue what court the case
               law originated in. Frisch kept asking to call his lawyer, and I
               told him to do it, but to make it quick. Frisch began to mock
               the way I said "quick" and he repeated it multiple times. As
               soon as he began to dial his dad he started to complain it was
               like midnight, and he probably was not going to answer.
               Frisch's father picked up the phone. Frisch told his father we
               pulled him over today, and then he later corrected and said
               tonight. He told him we wanted to get him out of the car and he
               wanted to know what he should do. Throughout the encounter
               Frisch's speech was very repetitive. Frisch put the phone on
               speaker phone. His father said Frisch does not need to get out
               of the car, unless he is being advised he is being arrested. I
               again told Frisch to get out of the car. Frisch asked if he was
               being arrested, and I said no. I told him I would arrest him
               for obstruction if he did not get out of the car. Frisch's
               father said I could not arrest him for obstruction for not
               getting out of the vehicle and told me he has a right to say
               no. Cpl. Daniels arrived on scene. I told Frisch again to step
               out of the vehicle, and he asked if he was under arrest. I told
               Frisch he was under arrest. I opened the door to his vehicle,
               and he began to come out. I reminded Frisch he was being audio
               and video recorded. I advised him he was under arrest for MIP.
               I placed handcuffs on Frisch (double locked). I searched him
               incident to arrest, without further incident. I placed him in
               the back of my patrol vehicle. I told him I was going to read
               him his rights. I pulled out my department issued Miranda
               Warning Card, and he began to smile and said, "wait you have to
               pull out a card to read me my Miranda Rights?". I told him I
               do, and I asked him if he had a problem with that. He went on
               to tell me he knows Miranda v., he stuttered and finally said
               Arizona. I read him his Constitutional Rights from my
               department issued Miranda Warning Card. I asked him if he
               understood his rights, and he said it's a verbal agreement and
               I agree. I asked if he understood and that would be a yes or a
               no, and he replied "it's a verbal agreement sir". Again, I
               asked is that a yes or a no, he replied "yes sir". I asked if
               he would be willing to talk to us now, and he said no. Frisch
               had not been contacted in the past for an alcohol offense so I
               decided to forward charges on him. I took Frisch out of my
               patrol vehicle, and I removed the handcuffs. I explained to him
               I would be forwarding charges on him to the Whitman County

               Prosecuting Attorney's Office for Minor Exhibiting the Effects
               of Having Consumed Alcohol in a Public Place. I told him he
               would be sent to WSU Student Conduct as well. Frisch told me he
               would assume he has not gone through WSU Student Conduct in the
               past. I told him he would be the one to know if he has dealt
               with Student Conduct in the past. At this time Frisch began to
               bend over at the waist and almost grab his knees. He went on to
               say he gets really nervous around authority. It appeared to me
               as if Frisch had to use the restroom. I asked him if he had to
               use the restroom, and he said no. I told him I would not drive
               his vehicle like Cpl. Daniels advised him earlier. Frisch told
               us he was not going to take the risk of driving forward 5 feet
               and for us to arrest him again. Frisch mentioned that would be
               double jeopardy. I told him he was free to leave. Frisch shook
               my hand and thanked me. We cleared the scene. No further
               action. My Vievu camera was activated, and the video was later
               downloaded into the permanent digital evidence folder. I
