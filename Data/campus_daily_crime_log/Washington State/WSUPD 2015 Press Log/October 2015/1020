    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Edwards/330 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5159 SYNOPSIS: Report of a threatening
               email sent from a wsu.edu email address. Determined to be a
               student email that has been hacked. WSU IT services has been
               notified and it working to fix the problem. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 10-20-15 at about 1222
               hours I was dispatched to the report of a threatening. The RP,
               Brian Schmeltz, was requesting phone contact regarding a
               threatening email he received from the email address
               mail39@wsu.edu. I called Schmeltz and asked him to explain what
               was going on. He told me the following; he said that today at
               11:32am he received an email message from mail39@wsu.edu in his
               inbox at schmeltz@pacbell.net. Schmeltz said the email had the
               following message "Please get back as ASAP. We need to talk".
               He said it was signed "Jose Soto". Schmeltz said that he felt
               threatened by this email because he feels like it is directly
               related to a theft case he is involved in. He said that he was
               the victim of a theft of a motorcycle and believed the police
               were very close to making an arrest in the case. This theft
               case is out of California, which is also where Schmeltz lives.
               I asked Schmeltz if he has any ties to WSU. He said his father-
               in-law was a WSU graduate many years ago, but that is it.
               Schmeltz said he wanted this taken care of immediately and
               wanted the messages to stop. He said that he only got the one
               message and that he responded to it with "Well make my day.
               WTF? Just email me your point." Schmeltz forwarded the email
               correspondence to me. I told Schmeltz I would update him on the
               status of the case and provided him the case number. When I
               looked at the email correspondence I saw that the original
               message appeared to be sent from jose.soto@wsu.edu. I did not
               see the email mail39@wsu.edu anywhere on the email
               correspondence. I was able to find a current WSU student name
               Jose Soto with an email of jose.soto@wsu.edu. I saw that he
               lives in Rogers Hall room 1125. I went to Rogers Hall room 1125
               and saw a name placard with "Jose" written on it. I knocked on
               the door and a male answered. I asked if he was Jose and he
               said yes. I asked him if he had been sending emails this
               morning around 11:30. He looked confused and said no, that he
               had been sleeping. He went on to tell me that his WSU email
               account has not been working and he has not been able to
               receive any email since September 25th. Jose got his phone and
               opened his email app. I watched him select his
               jose.soto@wsu.edu email account. He showed me that the last
               correspondence was on 09-25-15. Jose then selected the option

               to look at just his "sent" mail. When he opened that he saw
               several emails sent from "mail39@wsu.edu". All of the messages
               were sent at 1132 hours. He said he has no idea what was going
               on. We were able to look through his email account and saw that
               301 emails were sent at 1132 hours from his wsu.edu email
               account. All of the message said the exact same thing "Please
               get back as ASAP. We need to talk." At this time I believe that
               Jose was the victim of a computer crime and that his email had
               been hacked. I asked Jose if he had time to come to WSUPD with
               me so we could contact an IT Specialist. He said he would. I
               provided Jose with a ride to WSUPD and escorted him into the
               interview room. I was able to contact IT Specialist Den Bowker.
               I explained the situation to him and he advised that Jose's
               email account had in fact been hacked. He instructed Jose to
               take screen shots of the email that was sent, which he did. The
               screen shots were later downloaded to the Spillman Files. I
               gave Jose my business card with the case number. I will contact
               him tomorrow and assist with getting his email account password
               changed. I called Schmeltz back and advised him of what I had
               found. He seemed pleased with the results of the investigation.
               At about 1500 hours IT Specialist Patrick Domreis came to WSUPD
               to talk with me about this case. I briefed him on the
               information I had. He explained that Jose likely clicked on a
               phishing email that was sent directing users to change their
               password. When Jose did this, the hackers stole his password
               information and took control of his email account. They created
               the name "mail39@wsu.edu" to appear instead of
               "jose.soto@wsu.edu". Domreis advised that the with Jose's
               password the hackers also had access to all of his WSU account
               information, to include financial aid, student status, social
               security number and other personal information. I will contact
               Jose on 10-21-15 and help him reset his account password and
               talk with him about the compromise to his personal information.
               I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws
               of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 20th day of October, 2015, in Pullman,

               hours I was dispatched to an "other's" call. Whitcom advised
               that Lacey K. Pollard was requesting phone contact reference a
               male she does not like being in Regents Hall. I called Pollard
               but she did not answer. I left a message for her to call me
               back. At about 1415 hours Pollard called back. I asked her what
               was going on and she explained that there is a 28 year old male
               that lives in an apartment that comes to Regents to visit an 18
               year old female resident. Pollard said she has had problems in
               the past with this male and she does not like him being at
               Regents Hall visiting an 18 year old. Pollard went on to say
               that it would be a lot easier for her if I would kick him out
               of the hall rather than her "spending all her money" for a
               protection order. I asked Pollard why she would need a
               protection order. She said that she has had problems in the
               past with the male and doesn't want him in the same building
               she lives. She said she was going to get a protection order
               after her last case with him but didn't want to go through the
               process and stated again it would just be easier for her if I
               "kicked him out". I explained to Pollard that I cannot just
               kick out the guest of another resident because she doesn't like
               him. Pollard could not articulate any reason for me to contact
               the male other than "he's a 28 year old hanging out with an 18
               year old". I explained to Pollard that if he was in the hall
               without an escort or was violating the "guest policies" then
               she would need to contact her RA. She stated she understood and
               asked again if I could kick him out because that is cheaper
               than her obtaining a protection order. While Pollard was
               talking I looked up her previous case that she had mentioned. I
               scanned Officer Gordon's report and noted that he did not find
               any criminal activity occurring between the two. I explained to
               Pollard again that I was not going to kick somebody out of the
               hall, who is a guest of another resident, just because she
               doesn't like them. She stated she understood and would ask her
               RA if she could move dorms. I ended the call with Pollard.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 20th day of October, 2015, in

               student. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 10-20-15 at approximately 1600 hours, I was given
               information about a welfare check on a student who resides at
               Rogers Hall 329. Sgt. Macy stated he had gone to the subjects
               room and the subject was not home. I attempted to call the
               number provided by his mother, who was concerned because her
               son is shy and had not contacted her for a couple of weeks, but
               the phone disconnects. I contacted the RED of the hall who
               stated he would do some checking with his staff. He later
               called and stated the RA had seen the student earlier in the
               day and he seemed fine. They stated when they next saw him,
               they would have him contact his mother. They also stated they
               would work on reaching out to the student to get him more
               involved in the hall. I called the number for the RP,
               Rhondalyn, but she did not answer. I left her a voicemail
               telling her what I had learned and advised her to call back if
               she still did not hear from her son. I certify and declare

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5163 SYNOPSIS: Report of damage being
               done to a name tag on a bulletin board. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 10/20/15 around 1708 hrs I was
               dispatched to a reported malicious Mischief which had occurred
               in the lobby area of Gannon/Goldsworthy Hall. Upon my arrival I
               was not able to locate the complainant, later identified as
               Brittany A Griffin (07/26/89), and spoke with another
               unidentified female. This female told me there had been an
               inappropriate word written on a paper name tag of a resident
               advisor. The board itself had not been damaged. I was shown the
               board and removed a piece of paper covering the word "Fag" next
               to the name and picture of Resident Advisor Kevin W Pool
               (09/07/95). I took a picture of the writing and told Hall Staff
               they could removed and replace the name placard. I later
               contacted the individual who had found the inappropriate word,
               identified as Sarah C Allen (12/25/93), who told me the
               following. Allen explained around 0915 hrs she had been walking
               through the lobby area of Gannon/Goldsworthy Hall and hadn't
               noticed anything of note. When she returned around 1700 hrs she
               noticed the word "Fag" written next to Kevin Pool's name. The
               inappropriate word was covered up and she notified the Hall
               Director, Griffin, who later contacted Whitcom to report the
               incident. I asked if she had any idea who may have written on
               the name tag and was told she had no idea. After speaking with
               Allen I contacted Pool regarding this incident. Pool told me he
               also had no idea who may have caused the damage. When asked
               about if anyone was currently having an issue with him I was
               told he could not think of anything. I told him if he thought
               of anything which might be related to contact me and was told
               he would. We concluded our call a short time later and I later
               downloaded the photo taken to this case. No suspects and no
               leads at this time. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 20th day of October,

               contacted the RED and intoxicated subject who was identified as
               Matthew A. Kemper by his WSU Cougar Card. Kemper stated he had
               been going to an extra credit class which he doesn't like, so
               he decided to drink before he went. Kemper admitted to drinking
               a 1/2 of a fifth of Smirnoff Vodka. I could smell a strong odor
               of intoxicants and could see based on my training and
               experience he was intoxicated. Kemper was able to answer
               questions, but did continue to vomit while I was there. His
               roommate arrived after a short period and stated he would
               escort him to his room and check on him periodically. Kemper
               was not transported by medics and they released him to his
               roommate. They advised I could clear and I did. I advised
               Kemper my report would be sent to Student Conduct, and he
               stated he understood. I certify and declare under penalty of

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5169 SYNOPSIS: Report of a fire alarm
               which had been intentionally disconnected. The alarm was
               reconnected and was not damaged. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 10/20/15 around 2051 hrs I was
               asked to contact Whitcom regarding a fire call at apartment F-1
               located at 2025 NE Terre View Dr. Upon contacting them I was
               told the following. Whitcom explained Pullman Fire had been
               dispatched to a reported fire alarm coming from apartment F-1
               of the Chief Joeseph Apartments. Once they had found out the
               alarm was a trouble alarm, and not an actual fire alarm they
               told Whitcom they were not going to respond. Whitcom later
               spoke with Facilities Operations and learned a housing trouble
               shooter, later identified as Matteo M Molieri (02/05/96), had
               already been dispatched to deal with the alarm. Molieri was
               told to wait for my arrival before entering and upon my arrival
               I could not locate him. Prior to contacting Facilities
               Operations I attempted to contact WSU Fire Marshall Rod Holmes,
               and Ofc Darren Jones, but was unable to reach either one. I
               contacted Facilities Operations a short time later and was told
               the same thing Whitcom had told me. I was also given a phone
               number for Molieri and after speaking with them contacted
               Molieri. Upon reaching Molieri I was told he had already
               contacted the occupants of apartment F-1 and fixed the smoke
               detector by plugging it back in. I asked him if anything had
               been damaged and was told the residents had simply disconnected
               the alarm, which had sent Facilities Operations a trouble
               alarm, but the alarm had not been damaged. After connecting the
               smoke detector Molieri confirmed the system was no longer in
               trouble with Facilities Operations before clearing. I thanked
               Molieri for his time and after concluding our conversation
               cleared the call. I later received a phone call from Holmes and
               explained what I had learned. After a brief conversation I told
               him I would send him this case on 10/21/15 and for him to get
               in touch with me if he had any questions. Holmes told me he
               would and we concluded our conversation a short time later.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 20th day of October, 2015, in

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5172 SYNOPSIS: Welfare check on a
               student. Student contacted and provided resources. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 10-20-15 at
               approximately 2244 hours, I responded to Duncan Dunn 339 to
               contact a student at the request of her mother. According to
               the RP, Lynn, Anna has been having homesickness and was having
               a hard day. She stated Anna had thought about suicide, but she
               did not think she was currently suicidal. I contacted Anna and
               asked her if I could come in her room and talk with her. She
               said yes and I entered her room. I explained to her why I was
               there and we talked for about twenty five minutes. During our
               conversation, Anna admitted she was feeling a little
               overwhelmed at school and stated she had a bad day today. When
               I asked her if she had thought about hurting herself she
               stated, "not really". I asked her several more questions
               regarding suicidal thoughts and she admitted she had thought
               about it in the past, but had never made a plan to hurt
               herself. I did not feel she was in immediate danger. She
               admitted to having some depression, but had never seen a
               counselor. I talked with Anna about resources available to her
               at WSU and we spoke at length about Counseling Services. I
               asked Anna if she wanted to speak with a counselor tonight and
               she said no. I provided Anna a card with resource phone numbers
               and advised her I would be talking with the RA and RED of her
               hall, and would be forwarding her information to Counseling
               Services. She stated she understood. I also advised her to call
               us if she needed anything further and she stated she would.
               After I cleared, I spoke to Anna's RA. She stated she would
               follow up with her in the morning and work on getting her more
               involved. I then contacted Lynn and spoke with her about my
               conversation with Anna. She thanked me for contacting her and
               stated she would call if she needed anything further. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.
               Dated this 21st day of October, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.
