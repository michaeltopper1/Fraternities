               Rylee N. (02/25/96)/WA NARRATIVE: On October 22, 2015 at about
               0914 hours I was traveling north on Stadium Way approaching the
               intersection of Stadium Way and Wilson Road. I was flagged down
               by two (2) pedestrians who told me a female had been struck by
               a truck and was lying in the roadway. I saw a white F350 truck
               on the southeast side of Wilson Road near the mailboxes. A
               female was lying in the middle of Wilson Road near the yellow
               center line. There were several people around her. I advised
               Whitcom of the incident as they were toning out for Pullman
               Fire personnel to respond. I made contact with the female
               patient who was identified as Victoria V. Deleon (12/03/94).
               Deleon was lying on her right side. She was conscious, oriented
               and alert. She complained her left arm and left hip/leg were
               hurting her. She was wearing a backpack. She claims to have not
               hit her head and didn't lose consciousness. Deleon told me she
               was crossing Wilson Road in the marked crosswalk from the south
               towards the north. Deleon was on the east side of Stadium Way
               near French Administration. She waited for the walk signal and
               crossed when it appeared. Deleon described the truck makng a
               left turn from Stadium Way onto Wilson Road. She said the front
               driver's side of the truck struck her. She was lying about six
               (6) feet or more to the east of the Wilson Road crosswalk.
               Pullman Fire personnel soon arrived and patient care was
               transferred to them. Deleon was transported by ambulance to
               Pullman Regional Hospital. Sgt. Macy and Whitman County Sheriff
               Deputy DeRosier responded to the scene and interviewed
               witnesses. Dahmen and Look both said the truck hit the
               pedestrian in the crosswalk. Dahmen said that he looked at the
               pedestrian signal when the incident happened and there was
               still time counting down before pedestrians had to clear the
               intersection. Stewart heard the accident but did not see it as
               he was operating a lawn tractor nearby. Sloot told me he was
               the driver of the white truck. The truck belongs to the USDA.
               Sloot is employed by the USDA as a temporary worker. He told me

               he started work this morning at about 0800 hours. He was told
               to take the truck out to a farm on Whelen Road and wash it. He
               was unable to wash the truck as the shop was locked. Sloot was
               on his way back to the greenhouses to pick up cleaning supplies
               when the accident happened. Sloot was traveling southbound on
               Stadium Way. He made a left turn from Stadium Way onto Wilson
               when the truck collided with the pedestrian. He said he didn't
               see the pedestrian in the crosswalk. The weather at the time of
               the collision was sunny and clear. The temperature according to
               the National Weather Service Pullman/Moscow Regional Airport at
               0853 hours was 43 degrees Fahrenheit. The blacktop surface was
               straight and level. The pedestrian signal works as follows. A
               person must press the signal button. The traffic lights will
               change. The street the person is crossing is red to vehicle
               traffic. The street the person is paralleling is green to
               vehicle traffic. The pedestrian signal will turn to a white in
               color "walk" symbol. This lasts for approximately 5 seconds.
               Then a red hand appears and a countdown clock begins starting
               at 13 seconds. When I returned to the WSU Police Department I
               reviewed the traffic camera at this intersection. The camera
               shows the white truck stopped on Stadium Way at Wilson Road due
               to a red traffic light. The traffic light turned green on
               Stadium Way. Sloot had to wait to make the left turn due to
               oncoming traffic. The white pedestrian walk symbol is visible
               and Deleon entered the crosswalk. She was about halfway across
               the street when Sloot turned left striking her. Deleon was
               thrown at least six (6) feet or more. The front driver's side
               of the truck hit Deleon's left side of her body. Several people
               came rushing to her assistance. The traffic video has been
               added to the case file. Digital photos were taken. I issued
               Sloot Sector Infraction #5Z0227638 for violation of RCW
               46.61.525 Negligent Driving 2nd Degree. A Sector PTCR has been
               completed. At 1350 hours I contacted Deleon by telephone and
               provided her with case information. No further investigation. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 22nd day of October, 2015 in Pullman,

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5207 SYNOPSIS: Suspicious phone calls
               received at Holland Library. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: Matt Kyllo, WSU Academic Media
               Services in Holland Library, reported receiving the same type
               of strange phone calls they received in August of this year
               (see case 15-W3712). The individual called twice on 10/21/15
               and once today, 10/22/15, and asked questions such as; Do you
               have a Security Officer and what time do they work. As in
               August when the person who received the call puts the caller on
               hold to get an supervisor the caller is no longer on the line
               when the supervisor gets on the phone. According to Kyllo no
               information has been given to individuals calling. Kyllo asked
               what they should do? I asked Kyllo if the caller has ever been
               asked not to call back. Kyllo said he didn't think so. I asked
               if the caller ever said anything threatening or rude, and Kyllo
               said not that he has been told. I told Kyllo he should instruct
               his people if they receive additional calls like this they
               should inform the caller not to call this number anymore and
               hang up. Then if the calls continue it could be considered
               harassment and further investigation could be justified. At
               this time no crime has been committed. Caller ID indicated the
               number from which the call came from was 425-341-4423. When the
               number was called a message was heard saying "You have reached
               AFS leave the name of your company and a phone number, and we
               will get back with you". This appears to be the same message
               received in the previous case. No further investigation at this
               time. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the
               laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this ____ day of _____________, 2015, in

               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On October 22, 2015 at
               about 1456 hours I was dispatched to a report of a stolen
               bicycle. I contacted the complainant, Tyler J. Harmon
               (11/25/96) by telephone as requested. Harmon said he had
               checked out a WSU Green Bike. He wanted to dock it at Northside
               Residence Hall but all the docking spaces were full. Harmon
               locked the bicycle to a nearby fence. He said he removed the
               key and still has it in his possession. Harmon last saw the
               bike locked to the fence on Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at
               about 1100 hours. When he returned to the bike that same day at
               about 1330 hours the bike was gone. Harmon contacted WSU Green
               Bike personnel who told him the bike has not been turned in.
               They gave him the number "DO2014" that is associated with the
               bike. Harmon was told to contact the police about the theft. It
               is unknown who took the bike. The bike is valued at $1200.
               There are no suspects, witnesses, or leads at this time. No
               further investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 22nd day of October,

               providing a location for smoking marijuana and another subject
               was warned for smoking marijuana. Refer to Student Conduct.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Anthony H. Tran
               (031597) Warned Marijuana 2. Krubale L. Mulugeta (072497)
               Warned Marijuana NARRATIVE: On 102215 at approximately 1639
               hours I was dispatched to the odor of marijuana at Rogers room
               223. I responded and met with the RP, RED McClure. He directed
               me to room 223 where he and his staff had detected the odor. I
               could smell a mild odor of marijuana coming form the room. I
               knocked on the door and eventually Krubale L. Mulugeta (072497)
               answered the door. When he saw it was me, the Police, he
               rapidly exited the room and closed his door. He was visibly
               nervous with a pulsating vein in his neck. He did not know why
               I was there when I confirmed he was under 21 and asked about a
               medicinal marijuana card. He said he had an image on his phone
               of his medicinal marijuana card. I explained to him he would
               need to contact the Access Center if he needed to use marijuana
               for medicinal purposes, but that he still could not have it on
               campus. He told me we needed to hurry up our discussion as he
               had to take a pledge test at 5pm. I looked at my watch at saw
               it was 4:54pm. I told him he wouldn't have been on time in the
               first place. He then explained that dinner was going to take
               place before the test. I explained to him that he was being
               deceptive. I stated he did not have anything in the room he
               should not have but alluded to someone having something in the
               room that was not allowed. RED McCLure, informed me that a
               guest was in the room. I had Mulugeta retrieve his guest.
               Mulugeta then stayed in his room and closed the door. The guest
               was Anthony H. Tran (031597) who I have dealt with previously
               regarding marijuana. Tran was polite and hesitantly
               cooperative. He admitted to "vaping" in Mulugeta's room with
               his knowledge. Tran retrieved his pipe. I explained to him he
               could not have paraphernalia in the residence halls and he
               later disposed of it. Mulugeta came back out of his room and
               provided me with identification. I returned it to him and
               warned him about furnishing a location for people to smoke
               marijuana. I told him he was free to go. I continued to speak
               with Tan and run both of them. A few minutes later Mulugeta
               asked if he could leave. I told him I had already told him he
               could. Mulugeta asked for a business card. He asked if my card
               would have my badge number on it. I told him I could write it
               on there but tried,to no avail, to explain to him that my card

               would contain more identifiable information about me than my
               badge number. Mulugeta was provided a business card with the
               case number and my badge number. Mulugeta asked if he was being
               detained. I told him no, he was free to go, again. He left and
               I spoke more with Tran. I told Tran, that not only would I be
               referring him to Student Conduct, but also Counseling Services,
               as I knew this to be at least his 3rd drug related incident in
               less than 3 months. Tran was remorseful and polite. RED McClure
               was present for this whole event. I cleared. Nothing follows. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 22nd day of October, 2015, in Pullman,

               On 10/23/15 at approximately 0009 hours I was in my patrol car
               between the soccer field and Global Scholars Hall when the fire
               alarm started sounding. I walked to the front of the building
               as the occupants began to evacuate. I found the source of the
               fire alarm in the ground floor kitchenette. Someone had been
               cooking bacon and had burnt the majority of it. The area was
               slightly hazy. There had been no flame just smoke. Once Pullman
               Fire Department arrived on scene, they reset the alarm and we
               all cleared. END OF REPORT I certify and declare under penalty

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5232 SYNOPSIS: Subject arrested, cited,
               and released for DUI. BAC .090(IR) .091(EC) and .084(IR)
               .084(EC). NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Jose M.
               Maldonado Rodriguez 08/01/97 Cited/Released DUI 5Z1099081 2.
               NARRATIVE: On October 23, 2015 at approximately 0047 hours I
               was driving westbound on Stadium Way near Lower Drive when I
               noticed a black BMW sedan traveling eastbound towards me. The
               BMW was in the inside lane of Stadium Way with its right turn
               signal on. The BMW turned left onto Lower Drive with its right
               blinker still on. The driver never turned on their left turn
               signal. I pulled in behind the BMW and activated my emergency
               lights. The BMW pulled into the Presbyterian Church parking
               lot. I contacted the driver, Jose M. Maldonado Rodriguez
               08/01/97, identified myself, informed the driver I was
               recording, and explained the reason for the stop. I asked for
               Rodriguez's driver's license, proof of insurance, and vehicle
               registration. As Rodriguez looked for his documents I could
               smell the odor of intoxicants coming from the car. Rodriguez
               was the only occupant of the car. I asked Rodriguez how much he
               had to drink tonight and Rodriguez paused for a second before
               saying, "I... not been drinking tonight." I told Rodriguez that
               usually when people hesitate before answering questions they
               are not being truthful. I told Rodriguez that I could smell the
               odor of intoxicants coming from the car and again I asked
               Rodriguez how much he really had to drink. Rodriguez said,
               "maybe a beer." I asked Rodriguez when his last drink was and
               Rodriguez said, "maybe 30 minutes ago, I'm sorry about that
               Officer." I asked Rodriguez if I could check his eyes and he
               stated yes. I preformed an HGN test on Rodriguez as he sat in
               the vehicle. I told Rodriguez to follow the tip of my finger
               with his eyes only and do not move his head. During the HGN
               test I observed equal pupil size, equal tracking, and lack of
               smooth pursuit in both eyes. Rodriguez's eyes were bloodshot. I
               asked Rodriguez if he could come talk to me outside of the car.
               Once Rodriguez exited I asked him if he was willing to do some
               voluntary standardized field sobriety tests. Rodriguez stated
               he would. About this time Ofc. Whitman arrived on scene. The
               tests were conducted on a level and paved sidewalk in the
               parking lot of the Presbyterian Church. Rodriguez was wearing a
               sweatshirt, jeans, and basketball shoes at the time of the
               tests. The parking lot was lit by street lights, patrol car
               spot light, and personal flashlight. I explained to Rodriguez
               that I would be evaluating him on how well he followed my

               instructions as well as how well he performed the tests. The
               first test I administered was the HGN test. I instructed
               Rodriguez to stand with his heels and toes together and keep
               his arms at his sides. I told Rodriguez to remain in that
               position while I administered the test. Rodriguez stated he
               understood. I told Rodriguez to follow the tip of my pen with
               his eyes only and not to move his head. I held my pen
               approximately 12-15 inches away from Rodriguez's head. During
               the test I observed, equal pupil size, equal tracking, lack of
               smooth pursuit, distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum
               deviation, and onset of nystagmus prior to 45 degrees in both
               eyes. During the test I had to tell Rodriguez to keep following
               the pen. Rodriguez was guessing where the pen was going to go
               instead of following it. As Rodriguez stood before me I could
               clearly smell the odor of intoxicants coming from his breath.
               The next test I administered was the walk and turn. I told
               Rodriguez to place his left foot on an imaginary line before
               him. I then instructed Rodriguez to place his right foot heel
               to toe in front of his left foot and keep his arms at his side.
               Rodriguez got into the starting position as instructed. I told
               Rodriguez to remain in that position as I gave further
               instructions. I told Rodriguez, when I tell you to begin, don't
               begin until I tell you, you will take a series of nine heel to
               toe steps down the line, with your arms at your side, looking
               down at your feet, and counting your steps out loud. Once you
               reach your ninth step leave your lead foot planted and with
               your rear foot take a series of small steps until you are
               facing where you came from and again take nine return heel to
               toe steps. I demonstrated the test for Rodriguez. I reminded
               Rodriguez to keep his arms at his side, count his steps out
               loud, look down at his feet, and do not stop the test until he
               had completed it. I asked Rodriguez if he understood and
               Rodriguez said he did. I asked Rodriguez if he would like me to
               demonstrate the test again and he said yes. I demonstrated the
               test for a second time and Rodriguez stated he understood.
               Instruction Phase: While demonstrating the test Rodriguez
               stepped out of the starting position. First Nine Steps:
               Rodriguez started the test with his feet in the wrong order.
               Rodriguez missed heel to toe on step 2. During his first 9
               steps, Rodriguez was looking a few feet in front of him instead
               of looking down at his feet as instructed. When Rodriguez
               reached his 9th step he turned the wrong way and used both feet
               to turn. Return Nine Steps: Rodriguez missed heel to toe and
               stepped off line on step 2 and 8. Again Rodriguez was not
               looking at his feet, rather looking a few feet in front of him.
               The next test I administered was the One Leg Stand. I
               instructed Rodriguez to stand with his heels and toes together
               and keep his arms at his side. I told Rodriguez to remain in
               that position while I gave him further instructions. I told
               Rodriguez, when I tell you to begin, don't begin until I tell
               you, you will raise either leg of your choice and raise it six
               inches off the ground. You must point your toe so the sole of
               your shoe is parallel with the ground. While pointing your toe,
               keep your arms at your side, leg straight, look down at your
               foot and count out loud, one thousand one, one thousand two,

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
               one thousand three, and so on until I tell you to stop. I
               demonstrated the test as I explained it. I asked Rodriguez if
               he understood and he stated yes. Two different times why
               demonstrating the test he raised his leg and began the test
               without being prompted. Once I instructed Rodriguez to begin he
               raised his right leg and began counting. During the test
               Rodriguez was looking a few feet ahead of him instead of
               looking at his feet as instructed. Rodriguez counted to 1026 in
               the 30 seconds. I told Rodriguez that the last test I had for
               him was the PBT. I explained what the PBT was, that it was
               voluntary, and it did not replace the evidentiary breath test.
               I found my PBT (Alco-Sensor FST #16805) in working condition.
               Rodriguez provided a PBT sample of .087. I told Rodriguez that
               he was under arrest for DUI and handcuffed (D/L) him. I advised
               Rodriguez that he was being audio and video recorded. Rodriguez
               was searched incident to arrest and nothing of evidentiary
               value was found. I placed Rodriguez in the back seat of my
               patrol car. I told Rodriguez that his vehicle was going to be
               towed and wanted to know if there was anything in the car he
               wanted out of it. Rodriguez asked for his cell phone. Ofc.
               Whitman stayed with the vehicle and I transported Rodriguez to
               Pullman Police Department for BAC. Upon arrival I checked the
               Draeger and found it working properly. At 0112 hours I checked
               Rodriguez's mouth finding no foreign substances. I read
               Rodriguez his Constitutional Rights and Rodriguez stated he
               understood his rights and signed he understood his rights.
               Rodriguez asked to speak to a lawyer and I called John Snyder.
               After speaking with Snyder for several minutes we continued
               with the packet. I re-checked Rodriguez's mouth at 0124 hours,
               finding no foreign substance. I read Rodriguez the Implied
               Consent Warning for Breath and Rodriguez signed that it had
               been read to him at 0123 hours. Rodriguez checked the yes box
               that he was willing to provide a breath sample. Rodriguez
               provided a breath sample of .090(IR) .091(EC) at 0145 hours and
               another sample of .084(IR) .084(EC) at 0148 hours. The breath
               test was administered in accordance to the methods approved by
               the Washington State Toxicologist pursuant to the Washington
               Administrative Code. I provided Rodriguez a copy of the
               following documents: Driver's Hearing Request, Notice of
               Hearing/Conditions of Release, tow and impound form, and the
               breath test document. Rodriguez was issued Sector Citation
               5Z1099081 for RCW 46.61.502 DUI. I explained the citation and
               provided him with his copy. Rodriguez was finger printed and
               photographed. Rodriguez's vehicle was impounded by Myers Towing
               for 12 hours. My VieVu camera footage was uploaded to the
               department's computer. END OF REPORT I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
