               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On October 23, 2015 at
               about 0856 hours WSU Police were dispatched to a dog running at
               large in the area of Spokane and Campus Streets. I responded to
               the area. Whitcom notified me the dog had been dropped off at
               the WSU Police Department. I responded back to the WSU Police
               Department. A college aged female said she found the dog near
               Murrow running at large. She caught the dog and carried it to
               the police department. The dog is a golden/yellow colored
               German Shepard and/or mix breed. The dog is a neutered male and
               was wearing a collar with no tags. The dog appeared to be in
               good health and was very friendly. I took custody of the dog. I
               gave the dog a tour of the department. The dog did a meet and
               greet session with employees at the Police Department. He was
               energetic and entertaining. The dog assisted me with an escort
               of the WSU Football Team. I eventually transferred custody of
               the dog to the Whitman County Humane Society shelter staff. The
               dog was checked for microchips, none were found. Nobody had
               called the shelter inquiring about the dog. It is unknown who
               owns the dog or what the dog's name is. No further
               investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury

               Charges Forwarded Possession of Marijuana 2. NARRATIVE: On 10-
               23-2015 at about 1403 hrs I was dispatched to a report of two
               individuals smoking marijuana on the forested hillside located
               on the north side of Olympia Hall, 1620 SE Olympia Avenue. I
               arrived on scene and contacted two individuals, who were
               identified as Alex R. Botten (DOB 10-18-1996) and Kevin L.
               Gordon (DOB 11-15-1997). Botten was 19 years old, and Gordon
               was 17 years old. As I approached Botten and Gordon, I
               introduced myself and said hello. I asked them if they had been
               smoking marijuana, and they said yes. Botten and Gordon were
               sitting on the ground next to each other on a bath towel, and I
               could smell the odor of fresh marijuana originating from the
               area. I observed a grinder on the ground between Gordon's legs.
               I asked them if they could open the grinder so I could look
               inside. Botten opened the grinder, and I saw that it contained
               a small amount of green vegetable material (GVM). The GVM
               looked like marijuana and smelled like fresh marijuana. I told
               Botten to dump the GVM from inside the grinder onto the ground,
               which he did. I observed a bag of tobacco on the ground between
               Botten and Gordon. Gordon said the tobacco belonged to him and
               opened the bag so I could look inside. The material inside the
               bag looked like tobacco. I observed a glass bong on the ground
               between Botten's legs. Botten said he was using the bong to
               smoke marijuana. Gordon said he was using the bong to smoke
               tobacco. Gordon said he does not smoke marijuana. Botten showed
               me the bowel for the bong, and I saw it was empty. Botten said
               the bong belonged to him. I observed a tupperware container on
               the ground near Botten's left side. The container was within
               the reach of Botten. The container was clear with a green lid.
               I could clearly see GVM inside the container. I saw that the
               GVM was packed in plastic bags and looked like fresh marijuana.
               Based on my training and experience as a police officer, it is
               common for people to package marijuana into individual plastic
               bags. Botten said the GVM inside the container was marijuana
               and belonged to him. I asked him if he would remove the
               marijuana from the container and give it to me. Botten said he
               would do this and removed the GVM packaged in the plastic bags
               from the container and handed them to me. I saw that the GVM

               was packaged into two (2) separate plastic bags. The GVM in the
               plastic bags looked like fresh marijuana and smelled like fresh
               marijuana. I seized the plastic bags with GVM and later logged
               them into property as evidence. The total weight for the GVM
               (including the 2 plastic bags) was 30.31 grams. Also in the
               area, I observed two backpacks and a box. Botten and Gordon
               said the backpacks belonged to them and granted me consent to
               search. Botten said the box belonged to him and was the
               original box the bong had been contained in when it was
               delivered to him in the mail. Botten granted me consent to
               search the box. I searched both backpacks and the box without
               incident. Botten said he was the only one smoking marijuana and
               said he would take full responsibly for the marijuana I had
               seized. Gordon and Botten are both WSU students and had been
               contacted previously for a marijuana related incident. For more
               information, see case 15-W5148. Gordon was a juvenile, and I
               told him I would be contacting his mother. I later contacted
               Gordon's mother, Mandy L. Gordon (DOB 08-05-1977), on the
               telephone and advised her of this incident. I told Botten that
               the case would be forwarded to the Whitman County Prosecuting
               Attorney's Office for review and possible criminal charges. I
               cleared the scene. My Vievu camera was activated during this

               accessed via a rental computer from Terrell Library. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On October 23,
               2015 at about 1710 hours I was contacted by Pullman Police
               Officer Umbright regarding a harassment call he was dispatched
               to. Officer Umbright contacted the complainant and found the
               incident happened on the WSU campus. The case was reassigned to
               me for further investigation. I called the complainant, Anna R.
               Hoover (02/10/94) at about 1810 hours. Hoover told me she is a
               WSU student. She rented a laptop from Terrell library today
               between 1400 and 1500 hours. Hoover accessed her Facebook
               account on the laptop. Hoover returned the laptop without
               logging out of her Facebook account. She said someone accessed
               her Facebook account and posted messages that looked like she
               wrote them. The person was able to do so because the computer
               was still logged into her Facebook account. Hoover said the
               messages stated "She needed a big black cock to ride" and
               "Black cock matters." Hoover said the person also commented on
               her friends calling them "Ho's." Hoover contacted library staff
               by telephone. They would not provide her the information on the
               person who had the laptop after her. Hoover said she has screen
               shots and photos of the messages. She told me she will email
               them to me. I have not yet received them. Hoover deleted the
               messages and has since changed her password. I provided Hoover
               contact information for Title IX & OEO. She is concerned that
               Veterinary professors may have seen the posts thus hurting her
               chances of acceptance into Veterinary school. The investigation
               continues. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true

    Narrative: RVWD:MTK/336 OFC: DBT/321 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5260 SYNOPSIS: Three subjects contacted
               on Nevada St. near Olympia Ave. and they were all intoxicated.
               All of them were under the age of 21. Charges were forwarded to
               the Whitman County Prosecuting Attorney's Office for minor
               exhibiting and they have been referred to WSU Student Conduct.

               01-97 Charges Forwarded Minor Exhibiting/Alcohol 2. Ashlin E.

               Cidney A. Abad/08-15-97 Charges Forwarded Minor
               Exhibiting/Alcohol NARRATIVE: On 10-24-15 at approximately 0045
               hours I was on patrol in the area of Nevada St. and Stadium
               way. I was heading southbound on Nevada St. and came to a stop
               at the intersection up ahead. I saw three females on the
               sidewalk getting ready to cross the intersection. All three
               females appeared to be under the age of 21. The female later
               identified as Emilee G. Williams (DOB 08-01-97) could barely
               keep her balance. She almost fell over when I was watching her,
               and the other two females had to grab onto her to keep her
               upright. As soon as the crosswalk walk sign turned on, none of
               the females began to cross the street, but just waited there. I
               drove straight through the intersection, and parked my patrol
               vehicle on Olympia Ave. near Nevada St. I exited my vehicle and
               walked down to the corner of Nevada St. and Olympia Ave, where
               I contacted Williams and the other two females. The other two
               were later identified as Ashlin E. Hansen (DOB 05-12-97) and
               Cidney A. Abad (DOB 08-15-97). As Abad walked closer to me she
               was unable to walk in a straight line. She was walking forward,
               but pretty much drifting off to the left. I told them I needed
               to speak with them. I asked them how old they are, and both
               Hansen and Abad said 18. Williams continued to walk as if she
               was going to continue past me. I told her she needed to stop as
               well so I could speak with her, and she did. I asked for their
               ID's and both Hansen and Abad told me they did not have it on
               them. I advised all of them I was audio and video recording. I
               asked them how much they had to drink tonight. Abad said "a
               little bit", and Hansen replied "just a little bit" as well. I
               could smell the strong odor of intoxicants coming off of each
               of them. Williams, Hansen, and Abad had bloodshot and watery
               eyes. I told them they are almost falling down so that's the
               reason I was contacting them. Williams told me "we're making it
               back to our rooms right now, to go to bed". I asked to see
               their Cougar Cards, and they all told me they did not have
               them. Williams had very slurred speech and told me she did not

               know where her's was, and she apologized. Again, Williams told
               me they were just headed to their rooms to go to sleep. I asked
               Williams what was in her hand because I could see her holding
               her Cougar Card. She lifted her hand and handed me her Cougar
               Card, and again she apologized. Williams speech continued to be
               very slurred and repetitive throughout our encounter. Sgt.
               Griffin arrived on scene as backup officer. I asked if they
               lived on campus, and Williams told me she lived in Rogers Hall.
               Hansen and Abad both said they lived in Gannon Hall. Williams
               was swaying in a circular motion, and I asked her if she wanted
               to have a seat so she did not fall down. She replied,
               "exactly", and continued to stand and told me she would be
               okay. As I was gathering Hansen and Abad's information,
               Williams began to cry. Hansen was swaying in a circular motion
               as she was standing there. Hansen also had slightly slurred
               speech, but it was very slow and deliberate speech as well. As
               I spoke with Abad her speech was very slurred as well. I asked
               if they had been contacted in the past for an alcohol offense,
               and they all told me no. Again I asked all three of them how
               much they had to drink tonight. Williams told me she had a
               couple shots, but did not know exactly how much. I asked her if
               this is her first time drinking, and she said no. I told
               Williams she seems like she had a lot more than just two shots,
               and she replied "thank you". I told Williams that was not a
               compliment. I asked Hansen how much she had to drink, and she
               told me more than two shots. I asked her to guess how much she
               had, and she replied 6-8 shots. I asked Abad as well, and she
               told me she had 4 or 5 shots. Abad went on to tell me she is
               more sober than Williams and Abad. I told Abad I watcher her
               almost fall down too. Williams went on to tell me she could not
               remember the exact number and she was trying to be honest with
               me, but just could not remember. I asked them if they were all
               drinking together, and Hansen told me yes. I asked her where
               they were drinking at, and she said Phi Kappa Tau. I asked all
               of them if they have ever taken a voluntary PBT before, and
               they all said no. They asked me what that means, and I told
               them it shows me what their blood alcohol content is at.
               Williams provided me a breath sample of .218. I asked Williams
               if she had a roommate that could keep an eye on her tonight,
               and she said yes. Sgt. Griffin administered the PBT on Hansen,
               and she provided a breath sample of .136. Williams tried
               calling her roommate, but was unable to get ahold of her. Abad
               provided a breath sample .169. Hansen and Abad said Williams
               could stay in their room because she was unable to reach her
               roommate. I explained to all of them I would be forwarding
               charges on them to the Whitman County Prosecuting Attorney's
               Office for Minors Exhibiting the Effects of having Consumed
               Alcohol in a Public Place. I also told them I would be
               referring them to WSU Student Conduct, and they seemed to
               understand. I told them to go inside and stay inside otherwise
               they would be arrested, they said they understood. They all
               shook my hand and thanked me. Abad gave me a hug. We cleared
               the scene. No further action. My Vievu camera was activated,
               and the video was later downloaded into the permanent digital
               evidence folder. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
