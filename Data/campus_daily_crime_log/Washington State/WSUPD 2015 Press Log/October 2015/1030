               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5402 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched
               to a report of malicious mischief at McEachern Hall. An
               exterior window was broken, no suspects or leads. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 10-30-2015 at
               about 1336 hrs I was dispatched to a report of malicious
               mischief at McEachern Hall, located at 1500 SE Olympia Avenue.
               I arrived on scene and contacted the complainant, Andrew J.
               Beck (DOB 06-22-1991). Beck is the hall director for Stimson
               Hall. Beck showed me the exterior window to unit South #101.
               The window was double pane, and was located to the left of the
               entrance door. I saw that the exterior pane was broken, but the
               interior pane was undamaged. It appeared that something had hit
               the lower portion of the window and caused it to break. I
               checked the area but did not observe anything that could have
               been used to break the window. The damage is estimated to be
               $300.00 and occurred sometime between 2145 hrs on 10-29-2015
               and 0300 hrs on 10-30-2015. WSU Housing Maintenance had been
               contacted and was on scene. I photographed the window, and the
               photographs were downloaded into Spillman and attached to this
               case. No suspects or leads were identified. No further action
               at this time. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this __30__ day of

               WSU Counseling Services to Pullman Regional Hospital. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On October 30,
               2015 at about 1440 hours I was dispatched to WSU Counseling
               Services for a transport to Pullman Regional Hospital. I
               responded to the Washington Building and contacted WSU
               Counseling Services personnel. I was told that the patient
               wanted to kill himself and had said he will deny saying that to
               hospital staff. The patient has a history of depression. The
               patient was going to the hospital voluntarily. I transported
               the patient to Pullman Regional Hospital without incident.
               While at the hospital the patient told me he had served in the
               US Army for five (5) years. He spent a year in the middle east
               in combat. He was discharged in 2012. The patient went on to
               tell me he had been held in the Veterans Affairs Hospital in
               Spokane for a week due to suicidal thoughts. He was released
               this past Wednesday, October 28, 2015. He said his suicidal
               thoughts have not improved and he can't go on with his life. I
               briefed the doctor at Pullman Regional on the patient and his
               statements. Per RCW 71.05.150 I have reasonable cause to
               believe this individual is suffering from a mental disorder and
               presents an imminent likelihood of serious harm to himself. I
               took the patient into protective custody and released him to
               the care of Pullman Regional Hospital for the purposes of
               determining treatment needs. A copy of the protective custody
               sheet has been scanned into the case. No further investigation.
               I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws
               of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 30th day of October, 2015, in Pullman,

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5405 SYNOPSIS: Request to pass along
               information. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Root,
               Charles S (09/11/96) Contacted 2. NARRATIVE: On 10/30/15 around
               1600 hrs Sgt Griffin asked me to contact Chris Heatherly
               regarding information about a possible sexual assault. I
               contacted Heatherly a short time later and was told the
               following. Heatherly explained he is a member of the WSU ROTC
               Cadre and had two cadets, later identified as Steven M Herrera
               (10/08/96) and Karim Abdou (09/01/97), come to him with
               information about a possible sexual assault. He continued and
               explained he did not have much information at the time of my
               call but would be speaking with them around 1730 hrs and would
               contact me to arrange a time for me to speak with them. Around
               1745 hrs I received phone call from Heatherly. He told me both
               Herrera and Abdou were in his office and asked if I would like
               to speak with them. I told him I would and arrived a short time
               later. Upon my arrival I sat down with Abdou and Herrera and
               after being given an overview of how the information had come
               to Heatherly asked Abdou and Herrera to explain what they knew.
               Abdou and Herrera explained they had been at Pizza Pipeline
               ordering a pizza when they ran into a female, who wished to
               remain annonymous, who had recently been on a date with an
               individual they knew, later identified as Charles S Root
               (09/11/96). They had asked the female how her date went with
               Root and made a joke about it. The female responded in a way
               that left Abdou questioning the interaction. Abdou later spoke
               with the female again and was told Root and her had sex against
               her wishes. The female continued and explained both her and
               Root had gotten together in her room after both parties had
               been drinking alcohol and ended up having sex against her
               wishes. He continued and explained someone had later spoke with
               Root and told him his actions were out of line, after which he
               later spoke with Root. Root admitted to having sex with her and
               expressed confusion over the incident. Abdou went on to tell me
               during the conversation with Root he had admitted he had been
               drinking heavily prior to this incident as well. We continued
               to speak for some time, after which I gave both he and Herrera
               my business card and told them to give me a call if they wanted
               or needed to discuss anything else. They told me they would and
               I cleared a short time later, returning to the WSU Police
               Department. Upon my return I later contacted Root and asked him
               if he would be willing to come speak with me. He agreed and
               around 2210 hrs met me at the WSU Police Department. We sat

               down in the conference room at which point I thanked him for
               coming in and told him he was free to leave at any time. Root
               asked why I needed to speak with him and I told him I needed to
               cover a few things before we got into that. I read him his
               Miranda Warnings, which he signed and waived, and explained I
               had a few questions regarding some information I had regarding
               a date he had sometime back in late September or early October.
               Root sat silent and I asked him if any of this rang a bell with
               him. He told me it did and after some time I asked him what had
               happened. He explained he had gone out that night to a
               fraternity party in greek row. During the time he had been
               there he had consumed approximately 6-7 drinks in total. This
               total consisted of a jungle juice and beer. The jungle juice he
               had consumed consisted of 2-3 keg cups. After leaving the party
               he returned to his room in Streit Hall where at which point he
               told me he either called the female, or she called him. he
               couldn't recall, and couldn't recall whether he asked to come
               over or she asked him. He went on to tell me he had gone to her
               room in the Northside Residence Hall, explaining she has a
               single room and has been there previously. Once at the females
               room Root described the interaction as fooling around. I asked
               him what that meant and initially Root was embarrassed. I told
               him he was not going to offend me and he explained he and the
               female had each undressed, with him undressing himself and her
               undressing herself. Both of them laid down on her bed and began
               kissing, with him reaching up and grasping her breasts and
               sliding his hand in between her legs before inserting his
               fingers inside of her vagina. I asked Root what the female was
               doing during this time and he told me she was stroking his
               penis and kissing him on the chest. When asked what happened
               next he told me he began to rub the head of his penis against
               her clit after which he inserted it into her vagina. He
               continued and told me they continued to have sex with him on
               top of her for some time before he pulled out of her and she
               rolled over and up onto her knees at which point he inserted
               his penis again into her vagina from behind her. I asked him
               what her response was and he seemed confused and was shaking
               his head. He told me he thought everything was fine and
               explained how she had been telling him how great he was and how
               good it felt. After he pulled out of her again he told me he
               rolled over onto her back and asked her to get on top on him.
               At this point Root told me the female sat up and told him "We
               can't do this." Root said he was confused by this statement and
               immediately stopped. At hearing this I began to ask Root for
               clarification on what he had told me. I asked Root to explain
               the relationship between him and the female and if it was
               normal for them to get together and sleep with each other
               naked. He told me they have done this previously. He went on to
               describe their relationship at the time as what he described as
               working into dating. At this point Root asked me if we could
               get the two of them together and sort this out. I told him that
               wasn't going to happen and after explaining why that would not
               work continued with my questions. I went on to ask him about
               her statement about not wanting to have sex. He told me they
               had discussed that previously in the day, but as they were

               laying there and based on her actions he believed she did not
               have any issues. He again told me about the comments she had
               made and once she had said anything expressing a desire to stop
               or discontinue he stopped. I confirmed again she had not given
               him any verbal or physical indicators she wanted him to stop
               and was told she hadn't. Root continued and expressed confusion
               about this whole situation. He told me he and and the female
               have spoken several times since the night in question and they
               have hung out together several times, as recently as last
               weekend. When asked about the status of their relationship he
               told me they are friends, but they are not going to date. He
               went on to tell me they have discussed this night specifically.
               When asked about that conversation I was told she had told him
               she didn't want him to get in any trouble and expressed her
               desire to remain friends, which they are. We continued to speak
               for some time before Root asked me what was going to happen
               from here. I explained I don't know who the female is at this
               point, however if she decides to come forward and talk to us we
               might want to speak with him again. I continued and explained
               this case would be sent to OEO and Title IX for their review as
               well. We discussed this for some time after which I provided
               him with my business card and told him if he had any questions
               to contact me. He told me he would and after speaking for a
               while longer we concluded our conversation and he left. I later
               completed my report and cleared a short time later. I recommend
               this case be forwarded to Title IX and OEO until such time as
               the victim wishes to come forward. Nothing further at this
               time. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the
               laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 30th day of October, 2015, in Pullman,

               03/06/97. Johnson lives in room 314 and Herrera and Heinrich
               are not WSU students. I told Johnson if she was willing to turn
               over the marijuana and smoking devices, we would go to the
               dumpster and destroy it. I told Johnson that this case would
               only be referred to student conduct. Johnson agreed and grabbed
               a baby food jar that contained about one gram of marijuana.
               Johnson also had a ceramic pipe. All three females and I walked
               to the dumpster where the illegal items were destroyed. I
               explained the student conduct process to Johnson and cautioned
               all three to make smart choices this Halloween weekend. END OF

               at 1355 SE Olympia Ave. Dispatch advised the complainant could
               smell the odor coming from room #333, but thought the
               individuals may have left the room. I arrived on scene. I could
               not smell the odor coming from the room, but I knocked on the
               door. It did not sound like anybody was inside the room. A few

               told me he lived there. He opened the door, but I could not
               smell the odor of marijuana inside of the room. The
               complainants did not think those were the individuals they saw
               leave the room earlier. I cleared the scene. No further action.

               10-31-15 I was out at Ensminger Pavilion assisting Cpl. Edwards
               with crowd control when I saw a Jamare Davis yelling at Averi
               Moses. He was walking directly at her in a very aggressive
               manner. Due to the crowd noise I could not hear what he was
               saying, but she was backing up and he walked towards her. When
               he had almost got her to the side of the building I intervened.
               I grabbed Davis by the left arm and placed him in a gooseneck.
               He tried to pull away, but then realized who I was. I told him
               to stop resisting and that I was detaining him for
               investigation of a possible assault. He began to struggle and
               try to get away from me but I applied more pressure on the hold
               and he stopped resisting. At that time Officer Tiengo saw what
               I was doing and came to assist. I placed Davis in handcuffs
               d/l. I asked Tiengo to interview Moses and find out what
               happen. We escorted the two to my patrol car about 50 feet
               away. I searched Davis and had him sit in the rear of my patrol
               car. I went to where Tiengo was. He said Moses and he were just
               joking around and that was they way they expressed themselves.
               I told her I thought she was saying that to protect Davis. She
               said that Davis never touched her and that she was done talking
               to us. I had Tiengo give her a DV packet and told her to
               contact the police department if she wanted to talk more. I
               went to my patrol car and spoke to Davis. He said he was pissed
               at Moses but had no intention of striking her. I told him that
               what he had concerned me I was afraid he was going to strike
               Moses and that was why he was detained. He said he understood.
               I had his step out of my car and took off his hand cuffs. I
               warned him about any more aggressive behavior could result in
               him being arrested. He said he understood and he was allowed to
               leave the area. Nothing further.................. I certify and

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5429 SYNOPSIS: Case created to document
               the United Greek Council Halloween Dance at Ensminger Pavilion.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 10-30-
               15 at about 1830 hours I arrived at Ensminger Pavilion to
               provide extra patrol for the United Greek Council Halloween
               Dance. Upon my arrival I noticed the building was locked up and
               nobody was around. I was able to speak with Kayla F. Titialii
               who is one of the dance organizers. Kayla advised that the
               dance did not start until 11pm. I left the area and was
               available for patrol until 2230 hours when I went back to
               Ensminger. At 2230 hours I was at Ensminger with Inter Hammer
               and Intern Chase. Dance goers began to arrive shortly before
               11pm. I spoke with Kayla about how entry into the dance was
               going to work and she explained that they sold tickets prior to
               the dance but will also be allowing admission at the door.
               Kayla said that they will provide stamps for re-entry, but
               people who left were to go back through the security (pat down)
               line. She said that there will be five StaffPro employees who
               will provide security as well as pat people down before coming
               into the dance. Kayla said they were expecting around 400
               people at the dance. At about 2247 hours Officer Whitman
               arrived on scene to provide an extra patrol with me at this
               event. At around 2345 hours more people began to arrive for the
               dance. I could see that it was raining outside. Because
               StaffPro had instructions to pat down each person coming into
               the dance, entry into the event was taking a bit more time.
               Just before midnight I saw that the StaffPro employee that was
               working at the front doors (doing pat downs), closed the doors
               to Ensminger. I did not know what type of situation he had
               outside so I went out to see what was going on. He told me that
               people were pushing and shoving him back into the building and
               until they could back up and not push through, he was not going
               to open the doors. He told me that it was not safe for him to
               be in the position and he did not want to get hurt. The dance
               goers were becoming very impatient with the situation and
               started to get very loud and rowdy. They were pushing, shoving
               and shouting at StaffPro, the Police and each other. I advised
               all WSU units of the situation and asked for more officers.
               Sgt. Griffin, Sgt. Kuhrt (with Intern York) and Officer Tiengo
               arrived on scene. I briefed the arriving officers on the
               situation and could see the crowd was becoming angry. We all
               attempted to move the crowd back away from the doors so they
               could be opened again. Very few people were actually listening

               to us or obeying our commands to move back. As time went on and
               more people were arriving for the dance and the crowd continued
               to yell and push. Some turned their anger towards us and I
               heard people yelling "fucking pigs" and "fucking racist pigs".
               As we attempted to gain control of the crowd several people
               asked me to stop what I was doing so they could "snapchat" a
               picture of me. It was clear that most of the people at the
               dance had no respect for the dance organizers, security
               personnel and each other. We tried several times to move the
               crowd back, without success. Inside the Pavilion the lights had
               been turned on and music off in an attempt to get the crowd
               inside calmed down. It did not work. It was chaotic. People
               were running around, shouting, and several people were in the
               bathrooms smoking. After trying for about 30 minutes to re-open
               the doors I went back inside where I spoke to Benjamin A.
               Smith, the StaffPro supervisor at the event. He said the event
               was shutting down. I advised all WSU units over the radio that
               the dance had been shut down. I went back outside to help clear
               the crowd. I was announcing the party was over and asked people
               to leave. While trying to clear the crowd out, I walked past a
               group of males. I was saying excuse me and letting people know
               the dance was over. As I walked past the group of males, one of
               them assaulted me by intentionally throwing his left elbow into
               the center of my back. On my VieVu video, you can hear my
               reaction to being hit at about 19 minutes. At the time I did
               not feel like it was safe to go back into the crowd to detain
               the male. I was by myself and was not injured. I continued to
               monitor the crowd. At about the 23 minute mark of my video I
               heard somebody say "fight inside" over the radio. I ran into
               the Pavilion and was told the fight was in the women's
               restroom. Officer Westerman had arrived on scene and separated
               the parties involved. They were not injured and not identified.
               All of the officers on scene continued to try and get people to
               clear out. Sgt. Kuhrt, Officer Whitman, Officer Westerman and I
               formed a skirmish line inside the building and we were able to
               clear out the crowd. At about 0130 hours the building was
               finally clear and the crowd outside had dispersed. I then spoke
               with Kayla and Benjamin about what had occurred. Kayla was
               initially upset about the dance being shut down by Benjamin.
               Benjamin explained to her that it was unsafe for the StaffPro
               employees to continue getting pushed around and shoved into the
               building. He told her that to effectively provide security for
               an event with 400 people he needed at least 10 employees. Kayla
               said they did not have the money for 10 security guards and
               said she was hoping to make it work with 5. Benjamin said he
               had no idea the expected turnout was 400 people or he would not
               have agreed to work with only 5 guys to begin with. I told
               Kayla that it was not safe for anybody to let the dance
               continue. We spoke about safety issues and she seemed to
               understand and said that it was actually best that it was shut
               down because of the chaos. Throughout the night there were a
               few people who thanked the police for being there but most of
               the crowd was very disrespectful to us and StaffPro. I was
               specifically called a "fucking racist pig" and a "stupid
               fucking bitch". I also had "fuck you" yelled at me several

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5430 SYNOPSIS: Subject processed, cited
               and released for DUI. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               Jeric J. Guinto 05/21/96 Cited DUI C09968 2. NARRATIVE: On
               10/31/15 at approximately 0205 hours I was leaving the Gray
               Parking lot between the SRC and Beasley. The defendant's
               vehicle was traveling north on NE N. Fairway passing my
               location. It appeared the defendant was going well over the
               posted 20 MPH speed limit. I turned onto N. Fairway and
               activated my radar (Veh 17) and it displayed a speed reading of
               31 MPH. As I was catching up to the defendant I noticed I was
               traveling 54 MPH. I was not gaining quickly on the defendant. I
               got behind the defendant and paced the car at 40 MPH. I
               activated my emergency lights and stopped the vehicle near Nez
               Perce Apts. I contacted the driver and notified him the stop
               was being recorded and the reason for the stop. I asked for his
               license, registration, and proof of insurance. While the driver
               was retrieving his license I noticed he was having trouble and
               then almost dropped the license while handing it to me. The
               driver was identified by Nevada License as Jeric J. Guinto
               05/21/96. While standing at the car I could smell the odor of
               intoxicants emitting from the vehicle. Guinto provided me with
               the registration and insurance. I asked Guinto how much he had
               to drink and he said 2 beers about 2-3 hours prior. I asked
               Guinto if I could check his eyes and he said I could. I
               administered an HGN test with Guinto seated in the vehicle. I
               saw a lack of smooth pursuit and a distinct and sustained
               nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes. I returned to my
               patrol car and ran Guinto through Whitcom and he returned clear
               and current. I turned off my front facing emergency lights and
               returned to Guinto's vehicle. I asked if he could meet me on
               the sidewalk and he did so. I asked Guinto again how much he
               had to drink and he said 2 beers about an hour prior. I asked
               Guinto if he felt ok to drive and he said he did. I asked
               Guinto if he would provide a breath sample. I told him it was
               voluntary and did not replace the evidentiary breath test.
               Guinto said he would. I checked the PBT (FST # 62324) and found
               it in proper working condition. Guinto provided a breath sample
               of .128 at 0208 hours. I then asked Guinto how much he really
               had to drink then he said he had 2 orange juice drinks. I asked
               Guinto if he would perform some field sobriety tests to see if
               he is impaired by the alcohol he consumed. Guinto said he
               would. Ofc. Westerman arrived on scene around this time. I
               instructed Guinto that I would be evaluating him on how well he

               performed the tests and how well he followed my instructions. I
               administered the field sobriety tests on the paved and level
               sidewalk on the east side of the roadway. The weather was rainy
               with an approximate temperature of 50 degrees. Guinto was
               wearing a t-shirt, jeans, and black leather shoes during the
               tests. Lighting was provided by overhead lights and my
               flashlight. The first test I administered was the HGN. I told
               Guinto to stand with his feet together and his arms at his
               sides. I told Guinto to follow the tip of my pen with his eyes
               only with out moving his head. I held my pen approximately 12-
               15 inches in front of Guinto's face and administered the test.
               I checked Guinto's eyes and saw they tracked equally and that
               his pupils were equal in size. I did not see resting nystagmus
               in Guinto's eyes. I saw a lack of smooth pursuit and a distinct
               and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes. I
               saw an onset of nystagmus at approximately 40 degrees in both
               eyes. Guinto's eyes were blood shot and watery. The next test I
               administered was the walk and turn. I told Guinto to find an
               imaginary straight line and put his left foot on the line. I
               told Guinto to put his right foot in front of his left foot
               touching heel to toe and leave his arms down at his sides. I
               told Guinto to stay in that position while I explained the
               test. I told Guinto that when I tell him to begin, to take nine
               steps touching heel to toe, watching his feet as he walked and
               count each step out loud. I told Guinto that when he gets to
               step nine, to leave his lead foot in place and using his rear
               foot, take small steps around until facing the way he came. I
               told Guinto to take nine steps back touching heel to toe and
               counting each step out loud. I told Guinto that once he
               started, do not stop. I reminded Guinto to count each step out
               loud, keep his arms at his sides, and watch his feet as he
               walked. I demonstrated the test and asked Guinto if he
               understood and he said yes. I told Guinto to begin at any time.
               First Nine Steps: Guinto began the test and stepped off the
               line to the left on steps 1, 5, 7, and 9. Guinto performed an
               improper turn by spinning on his feet. Return Nine Steps:
               Guinto began the return steps and stepped off line to the right
               on step 1 and 5 and off the line to the left on steps 2 and 4.
               The next test I administered was the one leg stand. I told
               Guinto to stand with his feet together and his arms at his
               sides. I told Guinto that when I tell him to begin to raise the
               foot of his choice approximately 6 inches off the ground. I
               told Guinto to point his toe forward, look at his foot, and
               count out loud by 1000's until I tell him to stop. I asked
               Guinto if he understood, and he said yes. I told Guinto to
               begin at any time. Guinto raised his right foot off the ground
               approximately 2 inches and began the test. I reminded Guinto to
               raise his foot 6 inches, which he then did. Guinto did not
               point his toe as instructed. Guinto leaned to his left during
               the test and raised his left arm for balance on his counts of
               1017 and 1019. Guinto counted 1014 twice. Thirty seconds
               elapsed on Guinto's count of 1020. At this time it was my
               opinion that Guinto's ability to drive was impaired by alcohol.
               I told Guinto he was under arrest for DUI. I handcuffed (D/L)
               Guinto and advised him of his right to counsel. I reminded

               Guinto that he was being audio and video recorded. I searched
               Guinto incident to arrest, finding no weapons or items of
               evidence. I placed Guinto in the back seat of my patrol car.
               Ofc. Westerman facilitated the tow/impound with Autobody Super
               Center. I transported Guinto to Pullman PD for the BAC. Upon
               arrival I checked the Draeger and found it in proper working
               order with the mouth tube warm to the touch. I read Guinto his
               Constitutional Rights at 0236 hours. Guinto said he understood
               his rights and signed both signature blocks. I checked Guinto's
               mouth at 0237 hours, fining no foreign substance. I read Guinto
               his Implied Consent Warning for Breath at 0239 hours. Guinto
               signed that it was read to him and he said that he understood
               the warnings. I asked Guinto if he would submit to a breath
               test. Guinto checked the "yes" box and initialed next to it.
               Guinto provided a breath sample of .116 IR / .115 EC at 0257
               hours and a sample of .116 IR / .115 EC at 0300 hours. The
               breath test was administered in accordance to the methods
               approved by the Washington State Toxicologist pursuant to the
               Washington Administrative Code. I provided Guinto with a copy
               of the following documents: Driver's Hearing Request, Notice to
               Appear/Conditions of Release, the Tow/Impound Form, and the
               Breath Test Document. I issued Guinto a citation for DUI. I
               explained the citation to him and provided him a copy. I
               released Guinto from custody. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               1st day of November, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               was not saying anything just banging on the door. Officers
               arrived on scene and individual was no longer there. Individual
               was at the wrong room. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               2. NARRATIVE: On 10-31-15 at approximately 0238 hours I was
               dispatched to the report of a disorderly conduct at Gannon Hall
               room #205, located at 1459 SE Stadium Way. Dispatch advised the
               subject was outside banging on the complainant's door.
               Complainant advised he does not know who is outside, and they
               were not saying anything. Ofc. Whitman and I arrived on scene.
               As we arrived Dispatch advised the banging had stopped, and one
               of the Resident Advisors was speaking with the individual who
               was responsible for it. We went to room #205 and did not
               observe anyone suspicious in the area. I contacted the
               complainant, Dylan J. Rankin (DOB 11-11-96), in his room.
               Rankin told me a Resident Advisor had spoken with the
               individual about the banging on his door. I told Rankin he did
               the right thing by staying in his room and calling for help.
               Ofc. Whitman spoke with the Resident Advisor who dealt with the
               individual. The Resident Advisor identified himself as Salman
               M. Ibrahim (DOB 03-07-95). Ibrahim told Ofc. Whitman the
               subject lived on the next floor up, and he thought he was
               outside of his room. Ibrahim said he made sure the subject made
               it back to his room. We cleared the scene. No further action.
               My Vievu camera was activated, and the video was later
               downloaded into the permanent digital evidence folder. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 31st day of October, 2015, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer
