               about 0839 hours I was dispatched to a report of a female who
               was found in a bed at Chief Joe F5. The complainant, Hunter R.
               Weissenbach (07/06/94) just wanted to document the incident to
               protect himself. Weissenbach said he stayed at his girlfriends
               place last night and was not home. Weissenbach left the front
               door to the apartment unlocked. He said his roommate was home
               but in his room asleep through the night. When Weissenbach
               returned home to Chief Joe F5 this morning, he found a female
               sleeping in his bed. The female was clothed. He recognized her
               as his next door neighbor's girlfriend. He said her name is
               "Sam." He described her as a white female, 5 foot 8 inches
               tall, 130 pounds, with long brown hair. Weissenbach woke Sam
               up. She told him she had been partying last night and didn't
               know how she ended up in his bed and apartment. She left his
               apartment without incident. Weissenbach said nothing was
               missing or destroyed. There was no damage to the apartment or
               his belongings. Weissenbach just wanted this incident
               documented. He did not want me to contact Sam or any further
               investigation. No further investigation, the incident has been
               documented. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 8th day of October, 2015, in

               about text messages she is receiving. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: Jamie Waters was concerned about
               text messages she had received on two separate occasions. About
               two weeks ago while traveling back from Portland Waters
               received four or five text messages questioning the
               relationship she has with a male individual at WSU. The
               messages were along the lines of why are you leading this
               person on when you have a boyfriend back home, You should leave
               him alone before you hurt him. There was nothing threatening in
               the messages. Waters has no idea who the text messages were
               from. She said she checked the number, (208)450-3112, comes
               back to a residence in Hayden, ID. Waters believes it is a
               computer generated number through a special Ap that allows
               callers to be unidentified. There were no other messages until
               today when she received one additional text message, from the
               same number, where it mentioned something she didn't believe
               anyone else knew about, and this is what has her worried. There
               was nothing threatening in this message either, they just
               mentioned something that Waters doesn't know how they would
               know about it. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing

               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 10/08/15 around 1829
               hrs I was dispatched to a report of a disabled vehicle on
               Cougar Wy near the Northside Residence Hall. Upon my arrival I
               contacted the reporting, later identified as Pamela K Brooks
               (04/13/96), and was told the following. Brooks explained she
               had been driving her vehicle (Wa. AQP6657) Westbound on Cougar
               Wy when the indicator lights came one and the vehicle lost all
               power. Brooks was able to remove the vehicle from the roadway
               and park the vehicle before contacting the police for help. I
               looked at the vehicle and could see the emergency lights as
               well as the lights on the dash were functioning. I asked if the
               vehicle was all electric or if it had a gas motor and was told
               it had a gas motor. As we continued to speak she told me she
               could not even turn off the power or lock the doors because of
               the issues. I asked her if had a key fob and push button
               starter and was told she did. I asked her for her key fob and
               walked approximately 40 ft away and had her get into the
               vehicle and try to shut everything down. Brooks turned off the
               remaining systems in the vehicle I returned the key fob to her.
               Around this point we discussed several options and she told me
               she had contacted several companies, but they were closed. I
               obtained a phone number for the next non preference tow and
               gave it to Brooks. I told her the vehicle would be fine parked
               where it was until she had a chance to speak with her family
               regarding what they wanted to do about the vehicle. Brooks was
               also told if she had any questions or issues to contact me and
               I provided her with my business card for reference before
               clearing. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 8th day of October,

               10/08/15 around 1825 hrs I was dispatched to a report of an
               individual who had lost her keys in the area of Holland
               Library. I contacted the reporting party, later identified as
               Emma V Kurtenbach (05/11/95), and was told the following.
               Kurtenbach explained she was a resident advisor in Rogers Hall.
               She went on to tell me around 1522 hrs she had been in the area
               of the Compton Union Building and Holland Library when she
               realized she had lost her keys. She continued and explained one
               of the keys was to the lock box in Rogers Hall which provided
               access to the master key for the building and she was concerned
               about recovering it. I explained to her nothing had been turned
               into the WSU Police Department since I had been her at 1600 hrs
               and asked if she had checked the lost and found in both the
               locations she had told me about. Kurtenbach told me she had
               checked and had been told to check back later. I told her she
               should probably wait a couple of hours and check back to see if
               they had been turned in. In addition I asked her if she had
               contacted her supervisor to report the missing keys. She told
               me she had notified them of the the keys missing and was
               instructed to contact the WSU Police about it. I provided her
               with the case number and told her if she located the keys to
               let me know and was told she would. Around 2034 hrs I spoke
               with Kurtenbach regarding her keys again. She told me she was
               just about to contact me and had just been contacted about them
               being located. She thanked me for my help and we concluded our
               call a short time later. Nothing further at this time. I

               damage to the passenger side front quarter panel. Pictures were
               taken. Dispatch tried locating the victim vehicle but we did
               not have any success. I also checked AIMS. I later sent an
               email to Lt. Larsen to see if he could have WSU Announcements
               post a notice regarding the vehicle. I informed Rehman I would
               be doing this. He provided me with his insurance information
               and I gave him my business card with his case number. I
               cleared. Case closed pending further developments. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W4828 SYNOPSIS: Subject processed and
               released for DUI. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               Miguel E. Mendoza 07/30/96 Cite/Release DUI C09964 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 10/09/15 at approximately 0438 hours I was
               traveling north on SE Bishop Blvd approaching Main St. I
               noticed the light was red. As I rounded the corner I could see
               the defendant's vehicle stopped for the red light. The back of
               the defendant's vehicle was passed the stop line and his
               vehicle was completely blocking the crosswalk. I activated my
               emergency lights and VieVu camera, stopping the defendant on E
               Main near Stadium Way. I exited my patrol car and contacted the
               driver. As I approached the driver's window I noticed it was
               rolled down about 3-4 inches. As I neared the vehicle the
               driver completely rolled up the window and then looked
               confused, and then rolled the window down. I told the driver
               the reason for the stop and that the stop was being recorded. I
               asked the driver for his license, registration, and proof of
               insurance. The driver produced his WADL, which identified him
               as Miguel E. Mendoza 07/30/96. While standing at the vehicle I
               could smell a slight odor of intoxicants emitting from it.
               Mendoza was the only occupant. I asked Mendoza how much he had
               to drink and he said 1 beer approximately 2 hours prior. I
               asked Mendoza if I could check his eyes and he said I could. I
               administered an HGN test with Mendoza seated in the vehicle. I
               saw a lack of smooth pursuit and a distinct and sustained
               nystagmus at maximum deviation. Mendoza was chewing gum, which
               I requested he removed, which he did. I returned to my patrol
               car and ran Mendoza's information through Whitcom. Mendoza
               returned clear and current. I asked Mendoza to exit his vehicle
               and contact me on the sidewalk, which he did. I asked Mendoza
               if he would perform some field sobriety tests to see if he was
               impaired by the alcohol he consumed and he said he would. I
               told Mendoza the first test I would like him to do is the PBT.
               I told Mendoza the PBT was voluntary and did not replace the
               evidentiary breath test. Mendoza agreed to take the test. I
               checked the PBT (FST # 62324) and found it in proper working
               condition. Mendoza provided a sample of .076 at 0443 hours. I
               explained to Mendoza that I did not feel he was impaired so I
               did not feel the other tests were necessary. I told Mendoza
               that he was under arrest for Minor Operating a Motor Vehicle
               After Consuming Alcohol. I handcuffed (D/L) Mendoza and advised
               him of his right to counsel. I reminded Mendoza he was being
               audio and video recorded. I searched Mendoza incident to

               arrest, finding no weapons or items of evidence. I placed
               Mendoza in the back seat of my patrol car. Ofc. Westerman
               arrived on scene and parked Mendoza's vehicle in the Sella's
               parking lot per his request. I transported Mendoza to Pullman
               PD for the BAC. Upon arrival I checked the Draeger and found it
               working properly with the mouth tube warm to the touch. I read
               Mendoza his Constitutional Rights at 0458 hours, which he said
               he understood and signed both signature blocks. I checked
               Mendoza's mouth at 0458 hours, finding no foreign substance. I
               read Mendoza the Implied Consent Warnings at 0502 hours.
               Mendoza signed that they were read to him. Mendoza said he
               understood the warnings. I asked Mendoza if he would submit to
               a breath test. Mendoza checked the "yes' box and initialed next
               to it. Mendoza provided a breath sample of .083 (IR) / .084
               (EC) at 0517 hours and a sample of .081 (IR) / .081 (EC) at
               0521 hours. The breath test was administered in accordance to
               the methods approved by the Washington State Toxicologist
               pursuant to the Washington Administrative Code. Mendoza asked
               me if he could provided an additional sample since it was so
               close to the .08 limit. I told Mendoza that was well within his
               right as stated in the Implied Consent, but I suggested he seek
               legal advise first. Mendoza said he would like to talk with an
               attorney. I called John Snyder and Mendoza spoke with him.
               After speaking with Snyder, Mendoza said he did not want to
               provide a further breath sample. I issued Mendoza a criminal
               citation for DUI. I explained the citation to him and provided
               him a copy. I provided Mendoza with a copy of the Driver's
               Hearing Request, Notice to appear, and the breath test
               document. I released Mendoza from custody. Mendoza was
               extremely polite and cooperative during my contact with him.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 9th day of October, 2015, in
               Pullman, Washington. _______________________________________
