               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 10-18-15 at about 0741 hours I
               heard Pullman Fire units being dispatched "delta response" to
               the Vet Teaching Hospital ICU for a sick person. Whitcom
               advised that the subject was breathing but not responsive. I
               arrived on scene and contacted an unidentified female sitting
               on the ground in the ICU. She told me she was not feeling well
               so she sat down. Her co-workers told me that when the female
               sat down she became unresponsive and her eyes were dilated. I
               spoke with the female until medics arrived. Once they were on
               scene I cleared. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 18th day of
               October, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               Martin Stadium. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 10-17-15, during the WSU vs OSU football game at
               Martin Stadium, a Washington State Driver's license was turned
               into me in the processing room. The WADL belongs to Aimee N.
               Schell. I attempted to locate a local address or phone number
               for Schell but was unable to find any contact information. In
               addition, I found a red backpack in the processing room sitting
               in the corner behind the desk. I do not know when this backpack
               was turned in or who found it. There was nothing in the bag to
               identify the owner. I did find several small unmarked baggies
               containing pills. I used an online pill identifier to determine
               that the pills were ibuprofen and allergy/antihistamine
               medicine, both available over the counter. I completed a "Found
               Property Check-In Sheet" and placed the property into an
               evidence locker. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 18th day of

               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5105 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched
               to a report of a theft. The complainant reported that his
               camera was stolen from his recreational vehicle. No suspects or
               leads. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               10-18-2015 at about 1020 hrs I was dispatched to a report of a
               theft in the parking lot located on the south side of Beasley
               Coliseum, 925 NE North Fairway Road. I contacted the
               complainant, Paul D. Twibell (DOB 08-22-1967), on the
               telephone. Twibell reported that someone had stolen his camera
               from inside his recreational vehicle. Twibell said his white,
               2000 Ford E45 (WA Lic. WSU889A) was parked in the parking lot
               and numerous people had been in and out of his vehicle all
               night long during tailgate partying. Twibell speculated that
               some "drunk idiot" probably took his camera. Twibell said his
               camera was on a shelf in the closet of the recreational
               vehicle. Twibell said the camera was taken sometime between
               1930 hrs on 10-17-2015 and 0200 hrs on 10-18-2015. Twibell said
               an additional zoom lense and the camera case were on the shelf
               next to the camera but were not taken. Twibell said he found a
               broken plastic piece from the camera flash on the closet shelf
               and believed the flash on the missing camera had been broken by
               someone. Twibell described the camera as: Make: Nikon Model:
               D7000 Description: black in color, 18-100mm zoom lense, SP910
               flash Value: $1,100.00 No suspects or leads were identified. No
               further action at this time. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare

               driving on NE Campus St. near Community Duncan Dunn. I could
               hear an alarm sounding from the building. I looked up to the
               3rd floor and saw a subject flapping a towel madly in his room
               as if trying to get smoke out. I went up to the room (Room 369)
               and knocked on the door. The door was opened by a male subject,
               identified as Jacob Park, and asked why his alarm was going
               off. Park said he tried to smoke his e-cigarette and it set the
               alarm off. I told him he could not smoke inside. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
