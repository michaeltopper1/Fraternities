               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5063 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched
               to Honors Hall for a report of harassment. The complainant
               reported that an offensive note was found in the custodian's
               office. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 10-17-2015 at about 0830 hrs I was dispatched to a report of
               harassment at Honors Hall, located at 600 NE Spokane Street. I
               arrived on scene and contacted Maria V. Dickson (DOB 12-18-
               1958) and Susanna D. Opsal (DOB 05-21-1996). Dickson and Opsal
               are WSU custodians assigned to Honors Hall. Dickson and Opsal
               stated that someone had slipped an offensive note under the
               door of the custodian's office, Honors Hall #24. Dickson and
               Opsal found the note on the floor when they arrived at work.
               They showed me a photocopy of the note, which had been
               handwritten on a piece of ripped paper. The note stated, "I
               live in this dorm + would love to fuck the young janitor
               Sussie". Dickson and Opsal also found a similar statement
               written on the chalkboard near the breakroom. The notes were
               written sometime between 1530 hrs on 10-16-2015 and 0600 hrs on
               10-17-2015 and are believed to be referring to Opsal. I scanned
               the photocopy of the handwritten note and was later provided
               with a photograph of the chalkboard statement. Both were
               downloaded into Spillman and attached to this case. I discussed
               with Dickson and Opsal several ways to ensure their safety at
               work. I told them to contact me if the harassment continued. No
               suspects or leads were identified. No further investigation at
               this time. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this __17__ day of

               Exhibiting 2. NARRATIVE: On 10/17/15 at about 1254 hrs I was
               working at Martin Stadium for the WSU vs UO football game. I
               was monitoring foot traffic in the student plaza between
               Hollingberry Field House and Bohler Gym when I noticed Staff
               Pro security was speaking with a clearly intoxicated male. The
               male appeared to be under 21 and was stumbling as he walked. It
               was clear the male was questioning why Staff Pro stopped him to
               speak with him. I stepped over and was told the Staff Pro staff
               member thought the male, later identified as Connor P. Thompson
               (012297), was too intoxicated to go into the game. I asked
               Thompson how much he had to drink and he said not too much. I
               noticed Thompson spoke with slightly slurred speech and had a
               strong odor of intoxicants on his breath. I asked Thompson if I
               could check his eyes and he agreed. Thompson swayed side to
               side during the test and I observed he had bloodshot and watery
               eyes, a lack of smooth pursuit, and a distinct and an immediate
               onset of nystagmus. Thompson provided me with his WA driver's
               license that confirmed he was under 21. I advised Thompson I
               would be forwarding charges to the Whitman County Prosecutor's
               office provided he had never been arrested before. Dispatch
               confirmed he had no prior offenses on his criminal history. I
               advised Thompson he was also being trespassed from Martin
               Stadium for the day and he was released. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 17 day of October, 2015, in Pullman,

               W. K. Huston (08/20/97). C. Huston had been sleeping with
               earplugs in. I woke him up by knocking on his door. C. Huston
               looked at his phone and saw he missed several calls and text
               messages from his father. He said he will call him immediately.
               I asked C. Huston if he was having any problems or difficulties
               at WSU. I talked with him about resources available and gave
               him my business card that has several resources listed on the
               back. We talked for a few minutes and he appeared to be ok. No
               further investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of

               manner. She was still stumbling side to side as she walked. I
               contacted Emge as she entered gate I. I asked how much she had
               to drink and she said just a little bit. As she spoke I noticed
               she spoke with slurred speech and had a strong odor of
               intoxicants on her breath. I asked if I could check her eyes
               and she agreed. I administered a horizontal gaze nystagmus test
               on her and observed she had bloodshot and watery eyes, a lack
               of smooth pursuit, and a distinct and sustained nystagmus at
               maximum deviation in both eyes. She moved her head side to side
               during the test and swayed as she stood. I asked Emge if she
               had any ID with her and she provided me with her cougar card
               and date of birth. She admitted to being 20 years old and the
               information she provided confirmed that. I advised Emge she was
               under arrest for MIP exhibiting. I escorted her to the
               processing room and explained to her I would be doing some
               paperwork and forwarding charges to the prosecutors office. I
               advised her she was being recorded and read her her rights from
               a pre-printed card. I read Emge an ejection notice. I asked if
               she would be willing to provide a voluntary breath sample on a
               pbt and she agreed. She provided a sample of .179 on alco
               sensor FST #5493. Emge was escorted from the stadium. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 17 day of October, 2015, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer

               approximately 1335 hours I was working the WSU v OSU football
               game at Martin Stadium. I was standing in the concourse near
               section 29/30 monitoring foot traffic. I noticed a male subject
               walking with two females near the family restroom. The male
               caught my attention because he was walking very unsteady on his
               feet and was being helped by the females. As he walked he was
               very wobbly and looked similar to a marionette. I watched as
               the group went into the family restroom together. After
               approximately 10 minutes the three came back out and started
               walking east. As the male walked he was still unsteady and
               would bump into the wall. I followed behind them and as they
               stopped in line at the concessions stand I told the male I
               needed to talk with him. I walked the male away from the
               concession stands and near the wall. I asked him how much he
               had to drink and he said about 3 or 4 shots. As he spoke with
               me his words were slurred and I could smell the odor of
               intoxicants on his breath. I asked for his ID, which he
               provided, identifying him as Malivai R. Shankar 10/12/96. I
               explained that I would be ejecting him from the game and that I
               was going to escort him to the processing room. I told the
               female he was walking with what was going on so she could
               escort him home. Once in the processing room I asked Shankar if
               he would provide a PBT sample, which he agreed to with a result
               of .191. I told Shankar I would be sending the case to student
               conduct and read him the ejection warning. I escorted Shankar
               outside gate A and turned him over to his friend. Nothing

               approximately 1352 hours I was ejected a person from Martin
               Stadium at Gate A when I saw a male subject stumbling around
               hunched over. He was picking items up that he dropped on the
               ground, but would continue to drop other items. As I was
               walking to him, he continued stumbling forward and almost fell
               over. I walked up to the subject and asked him what was going
               on. The subject continued to stumble sideways and I had him sit
               on the back of the ambulance parked nearby. I asked for his ID,
               which he provided, identifying him as Tanner J. Sellman
               05/25/93. I asked Sellman where he was going and he said to A
               St. I asked Sellman where he was and he said "at the game". I
               asked Sellman if there was someone who could come walk him
               home. Sellman said he was fine. I asked Sellman to provide a
               breath sample, which he eventually did, with a result of .301.
               Although Sellman was able to carry on a conversation with me
               and answer my questions, he was not in any state to walk home.
               Ofc. Jones arrived on scene and provided a courtesy transport.
               Sellman gave me his game ticket and left an unopened beer. I
               threw both of them in the trash at Gate A with Deputy DeRosier
               witnessing it. Nothing further. I certify and declare under

               The dog was brought out of the vehicle and appeared to be fine.

               NARRATIVE: On 10/17/15 at about 1425 hours I was working at the
               WSU vs. OSU football game. I was dispatched to Section 30 for
               someone who was arguing with Staff Pro and refusing to leave
               the stadium. I responded and contacted a male, later identified
               as Tanner R. Trombley. He was still arguing but beginning to
               leave. Trombley said he wanted to talk to me. I told him to
               leave the seating area so I could hear him. We walked on to the
               concourse as Trombley continued to argue. Once on the concourse
               I explained to Trombley he was being ejected from the stadium
               and we needed to go to processing. He said he was not going

               on Trombley other side. Trombley attempted to pull away from
               Corporal Kuhrt as well. I used a straight wrist twist lock to
               control Trombley and escorted him to processing. In processing
               I asked to see Trombley's identification, he refused. I asked
               for his name and date of birth and he refused. Trombley stated
               he wanted to talk to his lawyer and attempted to call his
               attorney. Trombley continued to refuse to give his information.
               I read Trombley the trespass warning. Trombley's sister arrived
               at processing and gave us his name and date of birth. Trombley
               was escorted from the stadium. Nothing further. I certify and

               fighting at Martin Stadium. No suspects located. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 10/17/15 at
               approximately 1445 hours I was standing on the concourse on the
               west end of the stadium working the WSU v OSU football game. A
               subject watching the game came over to me and pointed out a
               fight in the top of section 30. I could see a large commotion
               involving about 10 people, but I could not see anyone actually
               fighting. I could just see bodies moving around and it appeared
               people were trying to break up the fight. I responded and when
               I got to the area there was no longer a tussle, but there were
               several people apologizing to each other. I contacted one
               subject who claimed he was punched. I identified him as Trevor
               K. Creek 06/06/94. Creek said he was punched out of no where
               and could not tell who did it. Creek said he was punched in the
               nose, but declined medical attention. I could see Creek's nose
               was red. I asked several people in the area what happened and
               it appeared that someone from above them threw something
               further down. Someone from lower down came up and started a
               fight. No one could identify who the subject's were. While
               talking with Creek I could see a male subject a few rows down
               with scratches on his neck and he was wiping his face with his
               shirt. I asked a nearby female if that subject was the one she
               saw fighting and she saw him in the area. I went to the male,
               identified as Joel Carrillo 02/02/94. I asked Carrillo what
               happened and he said that a male further up was trying to talk
               to a female and another male got into a fight with him.
               Carrillo said he went to break it up and got punched. I asked
               Carrillo if he could identify anyone and he said no. Later in
               the game I saw a group of males I recognized from sitting in
               the area of the fight. I asked them if they were able to find
               anyone involved in the fight and they said no. At this time I
               do not have any information on a specific suspect or suspects.

               and they told me they saw two males walking on Ferdinands Ln.
               The males started arguing and one punched the other. They
               yelled at each other some more before going separate
               directions. The male that was assaulted walked toward the RV
               lot behind the air supported structure. They did not have a
               physical description for this subject. The assaulter was
               described as a white male with long hair wearing a #12 cougar
               jersey. He was last seen walking toward Stadium Way on
               Ferdinand's Ln. I checked Ferdinands Ln and Stadium Way from
               Grimes to Cougar Way. I was unable to locate anyone matching

               behind the air supported structure but was unable to locate
               someone who appeared to have been punched. With the information
               provided the incident did not have any indication of actually
               being a domestic dispute and was more likely a citizen dispute.

               was driving northbound on Stadium Way near Wilson Rd when I
               noticed a vehicle, WA AOJ8000, which was driving southbound on
               Stadium Way. The vehicle caught my attention because it's
               driver's side headlight was not functioning. I turned around an
               initiated a traffic stop on the vehicle, turning on my overhead
               lights. The vehicle stopped on Stadium Way near the Fine Arts
               Building. I contacted the driver, Tiaira M. Thomas (021696),
               and told her the reason for the stop and the stop was being
               recorded. I asked for her drivers license, vehicle
               registration, and proof of insurance. She provided the
               requested information. I returned to my vehicle and ran Thomas'
               information through Dispatch. They advised her driving status
               was DWLS 3rd degree. I returned to Thomas' vehicle and had her
               step out to the sidewalk. I asked if she had any unpaid tickets
               and she told me she had paid that ticket but was not able to
               get the conformation number she needed from her ex-boyfriend
               because they were fighting. I told her that her license was
               still suspended in WA and until she got all of the issues
               straightened out she could not drive. I issued her criminal
               citation #5Z0985045 for DWLS 3rd degree. I explained the
               citation to her, she received her copy, and was released. Her
               passenger agreed to drive the vehicle for her. Nothing further.
               I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws

               approximately 2109 hours I was dispatched to the report of the
               odor of marijuana emitting from Orton Hall room #1130, located
               at 1475 SE Olympia Ave. Dispatch advised the individual was
               still in his room. I arrived on scene. I contacted the
               complainant, Edwin Serrano (DOB 09-28-91), who is the Hall
               Director on duty. He told me a couple Resident Advisors could
               smell the faint odor of marijuana emitting from room #1130 in
               Orton Hall. They told me nobody had left the room. I could
               smell the odor of marijuana emitting through the crack of room
               #1130. I knocked on the door, and male later identified as Khoa
               T. Nguyen (DOB 03-14-90) answered. As soon as the door opened I
               could smell the strong odor of fresh marijuana coming from the
               room. I asked Nguyen to come out of the room, and he did. He
               told me he was the only one in his room. I advised him I was
               audio and video recording. I asked Nguyen if he knew why I was
               there, and he said "yeah". I asked if he had a medical
               marijuana card, and he said no. I asked if he was 21 years of
               age or older, and he said yes. Nguyen provided me with his WA
               driver's license. I told Nguyen even though he is over the age
               of 21 he is not supposed to have marijuana in his dorm room. I
               asked him how much marijuana he had in his room, and he said
               under two grams. I asked if I may see it, and he said sure and
               asked if I wanted to take it. I told Nguyen if he wanted to
               give it to me I would take it. He handed me a small glass jar
               containing fresh marijuana and a small metal gold grinder,
               which also contained fresh marijuana. When he handed me the
               glass jar and grinder he said "it's all yours". Photographs
               were later taken of the grinder and marijuana and uploaded into
               Spillman. The grinder and marijuana were also logged into
               evidence for destruction. Nguyen told me he was smoking out of
               a vaporizer. I told Nguyen not to smoke in the dorms rooms or
               keep marijuana in his room. He told me he understood. I told
               Nguyen I would be referring him to WSU Student Conduct. He was
               polite and cooperative throughout my interaction with him. He
               shook my hand and thanked me. I cleared the scene. No further
               action. My Vievu camera was activated, and the video was later
               downloaded into the permanent digital evidence folder. I

               approximately 0024 hours I was dispatched to a cold drugs call
               at Gannon Hall. Dispatch stated Lorynda D. Guerrette 07/24/70
               was calling about her daughter, Dahlia N. Guerrette 03/03/97,
               who was having issues with her roommate regarding marijuana in
               the room. I called Lorynda who stated she wanted to know what
               she could do about her daughter's roommate who had marijuana in
               the dorm room. I asked Lorynda if Dahlia had talked to her
               roommate about the marijuana and Lorynda said Dahlia did,
               however the roommate did not think it was a big deal. I told
               Lorynda that her best option if Dahlia and her roommate could
               not come to a positive outcome would be to talk to her RA about
               the situation. I explained some of the options that the RA's
               could provide that I could not. After explaining this to
               Lorynda she told me I needed to talk to her daughter. I could
               hear Lorynda hand the phone to Dahlia who was expressing her
               disinterest in speaking with me. Dahlia eventually got on the
               phone after being pressured by her mother and I explained the
               same thing to Dahlia that I had told Lorynda. I asked Dahlia if
               there was anything else I could help with and Dahlia said no.
               This ended my phone call with Lorynda and Dahlia. END OF REPORT

    Narrative: RVWD: Boyd/335 OFC:MTK/336 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5098 SYNOPSIS: Report of the odor of
               marijuana coming from the 1st floor of Olympia Hall. Unable to
               locate/isolate. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 10/18/15 at approximately 0055 hours I was
               dispatched to Olympia Hall room 102 for the odor of marijuana.
               I responded and when I entered the floor at room 102, I could
               smell the odor of marijuana. I knocked on the door and the
               residents answered. I told them I was at the room for the odor
               of marijuana and asked if I could come in side, which they
               allowed. As I walked in, I noticed I could not smell any odor
               of marijuana. I saw a beer pong table set up and questioned
               them about it. They told me and showed me that it was just
               water. They opened all of their fridges and there was no beer.
               I did not identify them because there were no violations. I
               spoke with the reporting party, Edwin Serrano, and explained my
               findings. Once I exited the room I could no longer smell the
               odor of marijuana. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 18th day of
               October, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5099 SYNOPSIS: Subject reporting the
               odor of marijuana coming from a room in McEachern Hall.
               Officers contacted subjects who had marijuana, and they will be
               referred to WSU Student Conduct. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE

               Marijuana NARRATIVE: On 10-18-15 at approximately 0212 hours I
               was dispatched to the report of the odor of marijuana emitting
               from room E67 at McEachern Hall, located at 1500 SE Olympia
               Ave. Dispatch advised the Resident Advisor's had smelt
               marijuana when the occupants opened up their door. Sgt. Kuhrt
               and I arrived on scene. I contacted the Resident Advisor's on
               scene who told me they had went to room E67 to tell them to
               turn their loud music down. They said the occupants turned down
               the music, but they could smell the odor of marijuana when the
               door was open. I knocked on the door, and a male later
               identified as Jacob R. Maki (DOB 09-12-92) opened the door. I
               could smell the strong odor of marijuana emitting from the
               room. There was also smoke inside of their room. There was
               another male in the room later identified as James K.
               Greathouse (DOB 10-28-89). Both Maki and Greathouse live in
               room E67. I asked them if I knew why they were there, and they
               replied because of the odor of marijuana. Both Maki and
               Greathouse kept saying they smoked in a parked vehicle, but
               they had not been smoking in the room. Sgt. Kuhrt asked them
               how much marijuana was in the room, and Greathouse brought back
               a small baggie containing fresh marijuana. Greathouse said it
               belonged to them, and they had smoked the rest of it. After
               asking them several times what they used to smoke it with. Maki
               finally went over to his mini fridge and brought over a metal
               piece. I told both Maki and Greathouse even they are over the
               age of 21, they are not allowed to smoke or possess marijuana
               inside of the dorms. I told them I would be referring them both
               to WSU Student Conduct, and they seemed to understand.
               Greathouse went and destroyed the marijuana in front of Sgt.
               Kuhrt. We cleared the scene. No further action. My Vievu
               cameras was activated, and the video was later downloaded into
               the permanent digital evidence folder. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

    Narrative: RVWD:MTK/336 OFC: BRW/325 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5100 SYNOPSIS: Resident of Stevens Hall
               woke up to someone outside her window. Suspect ran off when
               confronted. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 10/18/15 at approximately 0223 hours I was
               dispatched to a possible burglary that had just occurred five
               minutes prior to the call. I met with Halie K. Gerde 01/26/97
               who lives in room 33 of Stevens Hall. Gerde said she was
               sleeping when she heard some noises by her window. Gerde lives
               on the basement floor and her window has an egress window well.
               Over the egress is a large heavy metal grate. Gerde said
               someone moved the grate and she could hear crunching of dry
               leaves in the window well. Gerde called out saying who's there
               and she then heard foot steps running away. Gerde said she only
               heard the noises and never saw anybody. Sgt. Kuhrt and Ofc.
               Tiengo had been mobile in the area and had not found any
               suspicious persons. I walked to the exterior of Gerde's window
               and found the metal grate sitting to the side. There were only
               dry leaves in the window well and no where nearby outside of
               the window well. Based on Gerde's statements and what I found,
               I believe someone had removed the metal grate and jumped into
               the window well before being scared off. I spoke with Gerde's
               RA who stated most of the windows on the basement and ground
               floors have security screens installed. Gerde's window does not
               have one. The RA stated she would put in a request with housing
               to have a security screen installed on Gerde's window. I told
               the RA I would also send over my case to housing. I asked Gerde
               if there was anything else I could do and she said no. I
               remained in the area on foot for several more minutes and found
               nobody in the area. END OF REPORT I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 18th day of
