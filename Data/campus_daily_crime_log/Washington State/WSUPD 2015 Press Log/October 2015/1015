    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: JAK/333 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W4988 SYNOPSIS: Whitcom received a report
               of an unknown "Middle aged, gray haired, white male who is
               approximately 5 feet, 10 inches tall" having entered lab 170A
               in Fulmer Hall on 10-13-15. This occurred between the hours of
               2000 and 2120 hours. This is a locked lab and the male should
               not have been there. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 10-15-15, I was asked to contact Trent B. Amonett
               (04-20-65) in Fulmer Hall, room 305. I responded to Fulmer Hall
               and asked Amonett what I could do for him. He said he received
               an e-mail from one of his Assistant Professors (Rock J. Mancini
               ) about an unidentified male being seen in a locked lab. The e-
               mail stated "A suspicious person (white male, middle aged, gray
               hair, ~5ft. 10in), accessed my lab last night (October 12,
               2015) between 8 pm and 9:20 pm using a key (Q851?) to go
               through my office before being confronted by one of my students
               in the lab. I returned to my office at 9:20 pm to find my
               lights switched off and things on my desk moved around. As far
               as I know, nothing is missing this time." Amonett said
               Mancini's office is located on the first floor of Fulmer Hall
               (170). He went on to say Mancini has labs in room 170A, 172,
               and 174. He went on to say these labs, as well as the office,
               are supposed to be locked as the lab in room 172 is a Bio
               Hazard Level 2 Lab. Amonett said the only people who are
               supposed to be issued keys to these labs are Faculty and Staff
               members. He said none of his Faculty or Staff members match the
               description of the unidentified white male. He is in the
               process of trying to get the department re-keyed. Amonett said
               it doesn't look like anything was stolen this time, but said he
               has reported several thefts of items over the last several
               months. Amonett requested security checks of rooms 170, 170A,
               172, and 174 be conducted during non-business hours if
               possible. I told him I would pass along his request. I gave him
               my business card and asked him to contact me if he determined
               anything was actually stolen. Nothing further at this time. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 15th day of October, 2015, in Pullman,

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W4992 SYNOPSIS: Request for a check on a
               student who is having a hard time at WSU. Case forwarded to day
               shift for follow up and extra patrol. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 10-15-15 at approximately 1600
               hours, I was advised of a professor wanting a welfare check on
               a student who has been having a hard time at WSU. I was able to
               contact the professor, Ulusola Adesope, at approximately 2110
               hours. Adesope stated he has known an International student who
               goes by the name Jefferson Ho. He stated Ho has been struggling
               with his academics at WSU and has been fairly withdrawn lately.
               Adesope stated he has been Facebook friends with Ho and Ho has
               confided in him that he also struggles with mental health
               issues. Adesope stated Ho has not been attending class
               regularly. Ho also, recently posted some photos on Facebook
               which were concerning. He stated the photos show Ho at a gun
               range holding and shooting a couple of firearms. A couple of
               people had commented on the photos saying, "what the heck?" Ho
               responded to them with, "You stupid human". Adesope stated in
               light of recent shootings at schools, he wanted to make sure
               the information was passed on to officials. I asked him to
               email me the photos and he stated he would. I later received
               them and attached the screen shot to Files. I advised Adesope I
               would make sure someone follows up with Ho and offers him
               assistance for academics and any other issues he made need help
               with. I asked him if he or the department had requested an
               officer presence at the class tomorrow and he stated the Dean
               was going to. He stated there is no direct threat, but there
               was a concern about him possibly having access to guns, based
               on the photos, and with his recent demeanor and troubles.
               Adesope stated the class was in Cleveland Hall 311 from 1000-
               1200 hours on Friday, October 16th. I advised him I would pass
               the request on to day shift. I advised him to call if he had
               any further information or concerns and he stated he would.
               Adesope preferred his name not be mentioned to Ho. I thanked
               him for the information and concluded the call. Extra patrol
               request and follow up will be transferred to day shift. Forward
               case to WSU Counseling Services and Dean of Students Office. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 15th day of October, 2015, in Pullman,

               2. NARRATIVE: On October 15, 2015 at about 1349 hours I was
               stopped at the traffic light on Stadium Way at Grimes Way. An
               unknown male crossing the street stopped at my vehicle and
               handed me a broken iPhone 6. He said he just found it in the
               street. He quickly walked away as the light turned. The glass
               on the iPhone is broken. The phone is white in color and has a
               black case. Because the glass/screen is broken I am unable to

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5014 SYNOPSIS: Dispatch advised of a
               welfare check at Streit Hall. The subject posted suicidal
               comments on his facebook page, and friends were concerned. I
               was able to determine the subject no longer goes to WSU.
               Dispatch advised Lynnwood PD, where the subject was, of the
               situation. Nothing further. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 10/15/15 at about 1946 hours
               Dispatch advised of a welfare check at Streit Hall. The
               subject, Joel Sierra, posted suicidal comments on his facebook
               page, and friends were concerned. I responded to the most
               recent local address we had for Sierra, Streit Hall room 639.
               The male who answered the door was not Sierra and it was a
               single room. I then checked myWSU and it showed a room number
               for Sierra of 633. I went to 633 Streit Hall and no one
               answered the door. I then contacted the RA for the sixth floor
               of Streit Hall and he said there was no one by that name on the
               sixth floor. I called the reporting party, Leiann M. Peterson,
               and asked her what specifically Sierra had posted and if she
               knew where Sierra was living currently. Peterson said Sierra
               posted that he had "lost the will to live" and "Bye everyone".
               She was not aware of where Sierra was living. I asked Peterson
               to take a screen shot of the post and send it to me, she did. I
               called the on call RED for the north side dorms, and asked if
               they had a current address for Sierra. They were unable to
               locate a current address for Sierra. I called dispatch and
               asked them to contact the phone company and ping the phone to
               see if they could get a location. I saw Sierra had one prior
               contact in Spillman. I looked for other names involved with
               that incident. I found a male, Brandon J. Pfeiffer, associated
               with Sierra. I called and talked to Pfeiffer, he had seen the
               post too and was concerned, he told me Sierra was living back
               in his home town of Lynnwood, WA. Dispatch called back and
               advised they were able to ping the phone and it was in the
               Lynnwood area. Dispatch relayed the information to Lynnwood
               Police Department. On 10/16/15 at about 0030 hours dispatch
               informed me that Lynnwood PD had entered a missing person file
               into NCIC and WACIC for Sierra. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Michael V. Solomon 09/12/87 Indecent Exposure
               2. NARRATIVE: On 10/15/15 at approximately 2330 hours I was
               called to Regents Hall where Katelynn M. Piazza 04/07/94, who
               is an RA, was reporting a sex offense for a resident. Upon
               arrival I meet with Jennifer O. Crawford 02/03/93 and Piazza in
               the RED's office. I asked Crawford what happened and she
               provided the following story. Crawford hangs out in the
               Veteran's Affairs Office regularly. The Veteran's Affairs (VA)
               Office is located in room 120BA in Terrell Library. Crawford
               said she has gotten to know serval people over the semester in
               the VA Office. Once person is Michael V. Solomon 09/12/87.
               Solomon and Crawford have had several conversations and both
               regularly hang out in the VA Office. Crawford stated that since
               the beginning of the semester Solomon has said, "you should
               overt your eyes, I need to adjust myself." Crawford said that
               Solomon has said this between 2 to 5 times over the semester.
               Crawford said she brushed Solomon's comments off. Crawford said
               that on Tuesday (10/13/15) or Wednesday (10/14/15) she was in
               the VA office and had fallen asleep on one of the couches. When
               she woke up she noticed Solomon was in the room. Crawford and
               Solomon began to talk. During their conversation Solomon again
               said that he needed to adjust himself. Solomon also made a
               comment about how he does not wear underwear. Solomon then said
               something to the effect of, "sometimes you just get a boner."
               Crawford glanced over to Solomon who had the tip of his penis
               poking out the top of his waistband and was pointing to his
               erect penis. Crawford stated Solomon's penis was sticking above
               his waistband by about two inches. Crawford said Solomon was
               wearing jeans and a tee shirt. Crawford stated Solomon's tee
               shirt was behind his penis and Solomon had not attempted to
               cover himself. Crawford became uncomfortable but attempted to
               ignore the situation as not to make it more awkward. Crawford
               stated she could not remember how much longer she stayed in the
               room before leaving and could not tell me if it was as short as
               a minute or as long as several hours. Crawford stated she is a
               poor judge of time. Crawford also was unable to remember if
               this occurred on Tuesday or Wednesday or narrow the time frame
               down from 1000 to 1300 hours. Crawford said there was one other
               person in the room when Solomon exposed himself. Crawford did
               not know the name of the male but described him as white male
               with olive skin, 5'9" to 5'10", dark hair with the front bangs

               stylized upwards. Crawford said the male was wearing a blue
               shirt that day. Crawford stated she did not know if the male
               had seen what Solomon did but the male looked concerned when
               Solomon made the comment about his "boner." Crawford said
               Solomon works in the VA Office and is the treasurer of ASWSU
               Student Veterans Committee. Crawford also stated Solomon's wife
               is an English Professor at WSU. I asked Crawford if she would
               like further contact from Solomon. Crawford said no she does
               not want any contact with Solomon from now on. I told Crawford
               that I would try and tell Solomon that however she should look
               into a no contact order through the court. Crawford was later
               provided with an ATVP resource packet that detailed how to
               obtain a no contact order. I told Crawford that I would contact
               Solomon and interview him about the incident. Crawford was
               given her case number and my business card. I asked Crawford to
               email me if she remembered any other details over the next few
               days. I went to the VA Office in Terrell Library. The VA Office
               is an unlocked room that anybody can enter as long as the
               library is open. There is one large couch and two oversized
               chairs in the room for people to watch TV. There is no cameras
               in the room. Also in the room is a reception desk for Blaine
               Golden's office. Golden will be contacted to see if he can
               identify the witness. I will speak to a dayshift Officer about
               interviewing Solomon. END OF NARRATIVE I certify and declare

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5024 SYNOPSIS: Subject was stopped for
               speeding on Stadium Way near Orchard Dr. He was arrested for
               DUI, cited and released. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR#
               1. Earl B. Gaines/05-29-93 Cited and Released DUI 10152 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 10-16-15 at approximately 0212 hours I was on
               patrol on Stadium Way near Martin Stadium when I observed a
               white, 2012 Chevrolet Colorado (WA Lic. B89123Z) traveling
               northbound on Stadium Way. The Chevrolet appeared to be
               traveling above the posted 20 mph speed limit. I activated
               vehicle 41 radar in the moving mode and it emitted a lound and
               increasing high pitched audio tone and displayed the
               Chevrolet's speed as 29 mph in a 20 mph zone. My vehicle speed
               matched with the radar. I operated MPH Python III Directional
               Radar Serial #846003941, tuning fork number 283191 and 282809.
               Both tuning forks are certified. I checked the calibration of
               the SMD before my shift and it is in proper working order. I
               later checked the calibration of the SMD after my shift and it
               was still in proper working order. I turned around to catch up
               to the vehicle. When I turned my patrol vehicle all the way I
               around I observed the Chevrolet cross over the center line for
               a few seconds before correcting and getting back into the
               inside lane. I caught up to the vehicle and I activated my
               emergency lights. The vehicle pulled over on Stadium Way near
               the Presbyterian Church. As the vehicle was pulling over the
               driver of the Chevrolet hit the curb hard with his front right
               tire. As I was calling out the stop on my radio I asked for
               another unit to respond to my location. I contacted the driver
               of the vehicle, who was later identified as Earl B. Gaines (DOB
               05-29-93). I advised him I was audio and video recording. I
               told Gaines the reason for the traffic stop was because he was
               speeding. He immediately said "sorry sir", and explained that
               he must have been because of the decline he was driving on. I
               asked to see his driver's license, vehicle registration, and
               proof of insurance. As he was gathering those I asked him how
               much he had to drink tonight, and he said he did not drink
               anything. He handed me his driver's license, but forgot to look
               for his registration and proof of insurance so I had to remind
               him. He handed me a piece of paper that was not his
               registration or proof of insurance so I handed it back. I
               noticed Gaines had a paper bracelet on his wrist like the ones
               you get at bars. I asked him where he got the bracelet from and
               he said they had an event tonight. I asked him where it was,
               and he said it was at Mike's earlier today. Gaines finally

               handed me his vehicle registration. Again I had to ask for his
               proof of insurance. Gaines then handed me a vehicle
               registration for the state of Idaho. Eventually Gaines was able
               to provide me with expired proof of insurance. I could smell
               the strong odor of intoxicants coming from the vehicle. I asked
               Gaines if he would be willing to take some voluntary field
               sobriety tests, and he replied "yes sir". I asked him to please
               exit the vehicle and he did. Ofc. Westerman was on scene as
               backup officer. I administered the field sobriety tests in the
               parking lot of the Presbyterian Church on Stadium Way. The
               parking lot was level and paved. The weather was clear and
               cold. Gaines was wearing a sweatshirt, jeans, and athletic
               shoes. Lighting was provided by my flashlight. The first test I
               administered was the HGN. I told Gaines to stand with his feet
               together and his arms at his sides. I reminded him I was still
               audio and video recording. I asked him if he was under the care
               of a doctor, and he said no. I asked if he had any injuries,
               and he told me had a contusion in his right thigh from flag
               football. I told Gaines to follow the tip of my pen with his
               eyes only. I told him to keep his head still. I asked him if he
               understood, and he said yes. I held my pen approximately 12-15
               inches in front of Gaines face and administered the test. As
               soon as I began checking his eyes he immediately moved his
               head, and I had to remind him to keep his head still. I checked
               Gaines' eyes and noticed they tracked equally and his pupils
               were equal in size. I did not see resting nystagmus in either
               eye. I saw a lack of smooth pursuit and a distinct and
               sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes. I saw
               onset of nystagmus at about 40 degrees in both of his eyes. I
               did not see any vertical nystagmus in either eye. The next test
               I administered was the walk and turn. I told Gaines I wanted
               him to pretend there was an imaginary straight line out in
               front of him. I told him to place his left foot on that
               imaginary straight line. I told Gaines to put his right foot in
               front of his left foot, with the heel of his right foot
               touching the toes of his left foot. I told him to stay in that
               position while I explained the test, and he seemed to
               understand. I told Gaines to take nine heel to toe steps down
               the line and to take nine heel to toe steps back. As I began to
               demonstrate the heel to toe steps to Gaines he got out of the
               starting position. I asked him to get back into the starting
               position, and he did. I demonstrated three heel to toe steps
               for Gaines. I told him once he gets to his last step to keep
               his lead foot planted on the ground, and take a series of small
               steps with his other foot. I demonstrated the turn and three
               more heel to toes steps for Gaines. I told Gaines to watch his
               feet as he walked, count his steps out loud, keep his arms at
               his sides, and not to stop walking until he completes the test.
               I asked him if he had any more questions, and he said no. I
               told Gaines to begin the test. Instruction Phase: Gaines got
               out of the starting position once. First Nine Steps: I did not
               observe any clues. Turn: I did not observe any clues. Second
               Nine Steps: I did not observe any clues. The next test I
               administered was the one leg stand. As I began to tell Gaines
               the instructions he lifted his leg off the ground and I had to

               tell him to stop and get into the starting position until I
               told him to begin. I told Gaines to stand with his feet
               together and his arms at his sides. I told him to maintain this
               position until I told him to do otherwise, and he said he
               understood. I told Gaines when I tell him to begin, to raise
               either leg of his choice approximately 6 inches off the ground.
               I told him to point his toe to keep his foot parallel to the
               ground. I was demonstrating the test to Gaines as I was
               explaining the instructions. I told him once I tell him to
               begin to keep his foot parallel to the ground. I told Gaines to
               count out loud by 1000's until I tell him to stop. I told him
               to look at his raised foot, keep his arms by his side, and I
               reminded him to not stop counting until I tell him to stop.
               Gaines got out of the starting position and I asked him to get
               back into the starting position. I asked him what leg he was
               going to raise, and he told me his right. I asked him if he was
               ready, and he said "yes sir". I told him he may begin. At the
               count of one thousand and six I had to remind Gaines to point
               his toe to make it parallel with the ground. Gaines got to a
               count of one thousand twenty-three after 30 seconds had
               elapsed. I asked Gaines if he would submit to a voluntary
               preliminary breath test (PBT). I told Gaines the PBT does not
               replace the evidentiary breath test. I checked the PBT (Alco
               Sensor FST #102460) and found it working properly. I told
               Gaines it should show zero since he has not had anything to
               drink. Gaines asked if brushing his teeth would detect some
               alcohol on the PBT, and I told him no unless maybe he drank a
               whole bottle of Listerine. He replied he did use some Listerine
               as well. He then said he did have some drinks earlier in the
               day. Gaines provided me with a breath sample of .157 at 0212
               hours. At this time it was my opinion that Gaines' ability to
               drive was impaired by alcohol. I told Gaines he was under
               arrest for DUI. I handcuffed Gaines (double locked) and
               searched him incident to arrest, finding no items of
               evidentiary value or weapons. I read him his Constitutional
               Rights from my department issued Miranda Warning card. I asked
               Gaines if he understood his rights, and he said "yes sir". I
               asked if he would be willing to speak to me now, and he said
               "no sir". I placed him in the back of my patrol vehicle. Ofc.
               Westerman explained to the passenger in Gaines' vehicle that it
               was going to be towed. I explained to Gaines the mandatory tow
               in Washington State, and he seemed to understand. I transported
               him to Pullman PD for the BAC. Ofc. Westerman facilitated the
               tow/impound with Myers Autobody. On the way to Pullman PD
               Gaines asked me multiple times about his passenger and what was
               going to happen to his truck. I found the Draeger in working
               condition, and the mouth tube was warm to the touch. At
               approximately 0212 hours I directed Gaines to the interview
               room so he could speak with an attorney. I called John Hart on
               the phone and advised him I arrested Gaines for DUI, and he
               requested to speak with an attorney. I left the interview room
               while Gaines spoke with Hart. I read Gaines his Constitutional
               Rights at 0250 hours. Gaines said he understood his rights and
               signed both signature blocks. I checked Gaines' mouth at 0258
               hours, finding no foreign substance. I read Gaines his Implied

               Consent Warning for Breath at 0256 hours. Gaines signed that it
               was read to him. I asked Gaines if he would submit to a breath
               test, and he said yes. He checked the yes box and initialed
               next to it. Gaines provided a breath sample of .145 (IR) / .146
               (EC) at 0319 hours and a sample of .145 (IR) / .144 (EC) at
               0322 hours. The breath test was administered in accordance to
               the methods approved by the Washington State Toxicologist
               pursuant to the Washington Administrative Code. Gaines was
               fingerprinted and photgraphed. I issued Gaines criminal
               citation #10152 for DUI. I provided him with a copy of the
               driver's hearing request, and explained it to him. I provided
               him with his notice of hearing/conditions of release,
               tow/impound form, and the criminal citation. I explained all
               the forms to Gaines, and returned all of his property to him. I
               provided Gaines with a courtesy transport to his residence. I
               later downloaded the video footage from my Vievu camer to the
               permanent digital evidence folder. I later faxed the DUI report
               to the Washington Department of Licensing. No further action at
               this time. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 16th day of October, 2015, in Pullman,

               a welfare check outside Northside Residence Hall. I responded
               and contacted the subject, Jarek L. Rasmussen. He said he
               called because he had a panic attack earlier in the day and he
               felt like he was having another one. Rasmussen said he had gone
               to student health and wellness earlier in the day because he
               was not feeling well. They told him he had a panic attack. I
               asked if he wanted to be seen by medics or if he wanted to
               contact a friend that could take him to the hospital. Rasmussen
               requested to speak with medics. I asked dispatch to have
               Pullman Ambulance respond to my location. Pullman Ambulance
               arrived, evaluated the subject, and transported him to PRH.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 16th day of October, 2015, in
