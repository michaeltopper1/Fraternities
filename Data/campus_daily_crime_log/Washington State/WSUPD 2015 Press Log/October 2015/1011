               was dispatched to a harassment call in Goldsworthy Hall. The
               R/P a Alenna Winfield wanted officer contact concerning some
               texts she had received from an ex-boyfriend. I responded to the
               Goldworthy Hall Directors office and contacted Winfield and RED
               Griffin. I asked what was going on and Winfield showed me a
               string of texts she had received from he ex-boyfriend Sonny
               Sowels. They had been broke up for about a month and all of a
               sudden she received a text inquiring what she was doing. She
               told him studying and he asked if she would come over and take
               care of him sexually. She told him no and that she had made it
               clear that she was no longer interested in him. Sowels became
               angry and told her to stop being a bitch. She told him she was
               not coming over and quit sending texts. I told Winfield that
               even though the texts were in poor taste there was no criminal
               law broken. I advised her to text him and make it clear she
               wanted no further contact from him in anyway. I told her if she
               wanted me to I would personally speak to Sowels. She stated
               that would be fine. Since the two had a dating relationship I
               gave her a Domestic Violence Packet and explain the ATVP
               services. She said she would call them if it came to that and
               we ended our conversation. At approximately 2130 hours I
               contacted Sowel in his Goldworthy Hall room. I informed him why
               I was there and he stated he had received a text from Winfield
               requesting no more contact. I told him he has not committed any
               crime, but if he contacted Winfield again it could he
               considered harassment. He said he understood and told me he
               would not contact her again. Nothing further at this
               time...................... I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the

               check on a student. As we were looking for the student the
               father called back and advised he received a text from his son
               and was no longer concerned. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 10/11/15 at a bout 2300 hrs
               Dispatch advised of a third party request for a welfare check
               on a student. Hall staff at Global Scholars Hall was reporting
               they received a phone call from the father of a student who was
               concerned. The father was concerned because he received several
               text messages from his son, Patrik Cvetojevic (040297), saying
               things like "it's over". The father had not heard from his son
               in approximately an hour and a half. Corporal Kuhrt and I
               responed to Cvetojevic's room, 343 Global Scholars Hall. I
               knocked on the door several times and his suite mate, Hoang
               H.L. Nguyen (070597), answered the door. I asked if Cvetojevic
               was there and Nguyen said he did not believe so. He allowed me
               to enter so I could knock on Cvetojevic's door. I did so and
               received no answer. We keyed into the room and visually
               confirmed Cvetojevic was not in the room. I began speaking with
               Nguyen about the last time he saw Cvetojevic and how he was
               acting. As I was speaking with Nguyen Dispatch advised hall
               staff received an additional call from the father, who advised
               he had heard from his son and was no longer concerned about
               him. I spoke with the reporting party, who confirmed the father
               called back and was no longer concerned about his son. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 12 day of October, 2015, in Pullman,

               and police could not find him outside. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE

               hours I was dispatched to a trespassing at McCrosky Hall. The
               reporting party told Whitcom that a subject that didn't live
               there had "barricaded" himself in the lounge, but left when
               asked by hall staff. The subject identified himself to hall
               staff as David Bishop. The reporting party said there was a 5
               minute time delay before calling dispatch. Officers searched
               the area, but could not locate a subject matching the
               description. Ofc. Boyd went and spoke with the reporting party,
               Valerie Haugen. Haugen told Ofc. Boyd that the subject had been
               sleeping in the lounge and had only barricaded himself in so he
               wouldn't be disturbed. He was compliant with hall staff when
               they escorted him out. I could not find a David Bishop in the
               WSU directory and the only David Bishop in locals lives in
               Clarkston. Unable to locate. I certify and declare under
