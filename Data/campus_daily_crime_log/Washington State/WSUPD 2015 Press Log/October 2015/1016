    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Olmstead/339 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5033 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched to a
               report of an assault. The complainant reported that she had
               been assaulted by her supervisor at the WSU Office of Student
               Involvement. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 10-16-2015 at about 1254 hrs I was dispatched to
               a report of an assault. Dispatch advised that the complainant
               was at the Pullman Police Department (PPD). I arrived on scene
               and contacted the complainant, Lauren R. Newbry (DOB 03-06-
               1987), and her husband, Phillip H. Newbry (DOB 02-29-1980), in
               the PPD interview room. Lauren explained that she was a
               graduate student in the WSU Department of Psychology and had
               received a graduate assistantship working for the WSU Office of
               Student Involvement. The Student Involvement office is located
               in the Compton Union Building (CUB) #320, 1500 NE Terrell Mall.
               Lauren stated she began working for Student Involvement
               sometime in June or July 2015. Lauren reported that during this
               time she endured ongoing sexual harassment committed by her
               supervisor and was also assaulted by her supervisor, who was
               identified as Humbler M. Cerrillo (DOB 09-16-1984). Cerrillo is
               the Assistant Director for Student Involvement. Lauren stated
               that she had already reported these allegations to the WSU
               Office for Equal Opportunity and their investigation is
               ongoing. Lauren and Phillip also mentioned that they have
               consulted with a private attorney. Lauren told me she is no
               longer working at the Student Involvement office and explained
               that sometime around the beginning of October she resigned from
               her assistantship position and withdrew from the graduate
               program. Lauren said she has met with her academic advisor and
               is planning on returning as a graduate student at WSU for the
               Spring 2016 semester. Lauren indicated that she needed the time
               off to recover from the harassment she endured at the Student
               Involvement office. Lauren reported that there are
               approximately 15 separate incidents of sexual harassment
               involving Cerrillo. Lauren stated she told Cerrillo she was not
               a "touchy feely" person and did not want to be touched. Lauren
               said the first incident occurred on 08-22-2015 during an Up All
               Night event at the CUB between 2100 hrs and 0100 hrs. Lauren
               said Cerrillo tried to get her to have sex with him, smoke
               marijuana, and drink. Lauren said she was up on the third floor
               of the CUB in the Student Involvement office with Cerrillo, and
               they were alone. Lauren said Cerrillo was instructing her on
               how to use the safe. Lauren said this did not make sense,
               because she already knew how to access the safe. Lauren said

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
               Cerrillo "very forcibly" pushed her against the wall with his
               hands. Lauren described this as not a violent push but more
               similar to what a person would do when "coming on" to someone.
               Lauren said Cerrillo brushed his mouth over her nose and then
               she hit him in the throat and kneed him in the stomach. Lauren
               said Cerrillo was hunched over, and she ran away. Lauren could
               not remember how Cerrillo was holding her against the wall and
               told me she just remembered being "held". Lauren said Cerrillo
               never said anything to her, other than the instructions for the
               safe. Lauren never explained to me what she meant when she told
               me Cerrillo tried to get her to have sex, smoke marijuana, and
               drink. At this point in the interview, Lauren's demeanor
               changed dramatically. Throughout the beginning of the
               interview, Lauren appeared to be angry and somewhat
               confrontational but now she began to cry uncontrollably. Lauren
               said she never hit anyone before, but she didn't feel bad
               because she didn't feel like Cerrillo was "human". Lauren
               described the harassment as a "constant thing". She said
               Cerrillo always arranged for them to be alone together, would
               touch her shoulder (such as when a supervisor would talk to an
               employee and tell them they are doing a good job), and would
               touch her near the middle of her back (such as when someone
               would escort another person through a narrow doorway). Lauren
               said she told Cerrillo she didn't want to be touched and
               referred to him as a "fucking asshole". Lauren described an
               incident when she was expecting to give Cerrillo a handshake,
               but Cerrillo gave her a hug that she described as being "so
               disgusting". Lauren said she was so upset she left the office,
               vomited, and cut her arms because she felt so guilty. Lauren
               was wailing and sobbing during the interview and said she has
               been seeing a therapist at River Place Counseling. Lauren
               described herself as being "so messing up" and began crying
               uncontrollably. Lauren was sobbing and crying hysterically and
               was apparently talking about various random events involving
               Cerrillo, work functions, and other Student Involvement
               employees. It became increasingly difficult for me to
               understand what she was talking about. Lauren mentioned
               something about a conference and not wanting to stay in a cabin
               with Cerrillo and some other ASWSU student. Lauren said
               something about someone knocking on her door, and she knew the
               person's "intentions". She talked about someone "women bashing"
               and talking about who they "tapped". Lauren described secret
               meetings and scheduling inconsistencies that created a "gap in
               time" so they could be alone. Lauren told me the employees in
               the office have an allegiance and cover things up. Lauren
               mentioned someone being drunk in public and making sandwiches
               for employees. Lauren repeatedly stated that she didn't
               understand the office and didn't "get it". Lauren began to
               regain her composure during the interview, and I asked her
               about the hug she had mentioned earlier. Lauren said the
               incident occurred sometime in September in Cerrillo's office.
               Lauren said Cerrillo hugged her inappropriately and similar to
               how a husband and wife would hug each other if they were crazy
               and passionate about each other. I asked Lauren to describe
               where Cerrillo's hand were during the hug. Phillip answered and

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
               told me that Cerrillo's hands were massaging Lauren's
               shoulders. Lauren described it as similar to a massage
               therapist. During the interview, Phillip mentioned an incident
               where Cerrillo chased Lauren into the stairs and tried to give
               her a hug, but Lauren slapped his hands away. Lauren was not
               able to clearly remember this incident. Lauren told me there
               were secret meetings, and she was being singled out because she
               did not participate and socialize with others in the office. I
               asked Lauren what the secret meetings where about. Lauren said
               they were taking her programmers, planning events without her,
               and making changes to events without consulting with her.
               Lauren said she was frustrated and didn't know what to do.
               Lauren stated she packed up and left the office about two weeks
               ago. Lauren said her WSU advisor told her she needed to
               withdraw because of where she was "cognitively". I asked Lauren
               about her therapist at River Place Counseling and if she wanted
               to hurt herself right now. I inquired about Lauren cutting her
               arms, and she said she has not cut herself for two weeks.
               Lauren said she did not want to hurt herself and described
               herself as being "numb". Lauren said at first she felt like she
               wanted to die, but she now realizes she wants to live and
               hopefully become a therapist some day. Lauren declined my offer
               to assist her with seeing a counselor and told me she can see
               her own therapist if needed at any time. I reviewed the
               information Lauren had provided to me during the interview. I
               determined that the majority of the incidents she described
               could be categorized as unwanted and inappropriate touching at
               the workplace. Lauren said she was not compliant, so she was
               "fucked". Lauren said she was not willing to "whore herself
               out". Lauren said she learned later that other graduate
               assistants never last more than a year in her position and
               attributed this to Cerrillo's behavior. After considering all
               the information Lauren had provided, I explained to her that I
               had identified three incidents which could be considered
               criminal in nature. The first was the incident when Cerrillo
               had pushed Lauren up against the wall when showing her how to
               use the safe. The second was the incident when Cerrillo gave
               her a hug and massaged her shoulders. The third was when
               Cerrillo chased her into the stairs and tried to give her a
               hug. I explained to Lauren that I would conduct a criminal
               investigation focussing on those three events. I explained to
               Lauren that the other events she described to me did not appear
               to be criminal acts and would more appropriately be defined as
               workplace sexual harassment. I reminded Lauren that she had
               already reported this to the Office for Equal Opportunity, and
               they would investigate the allegations of sexual harassment. I
               explained to Lauren that depending on the outcome of the
               criminal investigation, the case would be forwarded to the
               Whitman County Prosecuting Attorney's Office for review. I
               concluded the interview, and Phillip and Lauren left the police
               department. My Vievu camera was activated during this incident.
               For more details, see the video, which was downloaded into the
               permanent digital evidence file. Investigation continues.

               NARRATIVE: On October 16, 2015 at about 1315 hours I was
               dispatched to a citizen assist at the CUB. CUB staff was
               requesting assistance with recovering an employee's Cougar Card
               that accidentally got kicked under a locked door. I responded
               to the CUB and made contact with staff. An employee dropped his
               Cougar Card after using it to clock out. The card was then
               accidentally kicked under a door located next to the time
               clock. The room is located behind the information desk and
               houses an ATM. I keyed into the the room, opened the door and
               located the card on the floor. I recovered the card and secured

               10/16/15 around 1630 hrs I was dispatched to a report of a
               driver of a vehicle talking on his cell phone and speeding. The
               driver also reportedly nearly hit pedestrians in the crosswalk.
               After looking at the information I asked Whitcom to run and
               attach the plate they had been given (Or. 670ES2). This was not
               a valid plate and the similar plate attached did not match the
               vehicle type described. Due to the delay in responding to this
               call the vehicle was unable to be located and I recommend this
               case be closed. Nothing further. I certify and declare under

               the report of a theft. The RP, Janelle M. Lugo, was requesting
               phone contact. I called Lugo and asked her what was going on.
               She said that sometime today, between 9am and 5pm, the front
               license plate to her car was stolen. She provided a license
               plate of WA/WSU298A. She described the license plate as a
               crimson colored cougar plate. I asked Lugo if she thought that
               maybe the license plate fell off of her vehicle and she said
               she did not think so. Lugo told me that the rear license plate
               was still attached to her car. I told Lugo that she would need
               to contact DOL for a new license plate and I gave her the case
               number. I completed the NCIC teletype for stolen property and
               placed it in the records box. No suspects or leads. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.

               On 10-16-15 at about 1734 hours I heard Pullman Fire being

               advised that the subject twisted their ankle and was feeling
               dizzy. I responded to the scene and contacted an unidentified
               female that was sitting on the ground. She said her foot was
               asleep and when she tried to walk her ankle gave out, causing
               her to fall to the ground. She told me she initially felt dizzy
               but was much better now. She did not appear to be in any pain.
               We made small talk until medics arrived. Once they were on

    Narrative: RVWD:MTK/336 OFC: DBT/321 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5050 SYNOPSIS: Fire alarm was set off in
               Stephenson East. Pullman Fire arrived on scene and determined
               it was going off because someone had moved the fire
               extinguisher. Officer responded, no suspects or leads at this
               time. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               10-16-15 at approximately 2123 hours Pullman Fire responded to
               a fire alarm at Stephenson East 13th floor, located at 1265 SE
               Stadium Way. Dispatch was advised that someone had moved the
               fire extinguisher and there is now an alarm sounding from the
               panel. Pullman Fire arrived on scene and later requested and
               officer respond to the location. I arrived on scene. I went up
               to the 13th floor and met Pullman Fire along with the
               complainant, Madeline H. Marsh (DOB 04-16-95), who is the
               Resident Advisor on the 13th floor. My Vievu camera was
               activated, and the video was later downloaded into the
               permanent digital evidence folder. Marsh told me the cable on
               the fire extinguisher was pulled and that is what set off the
               alarm. She said if you push it back in the alarm shuts back
               off. She mentioned there is a male who lives on the 12th floor
               who likes to do a lot of pranks. She said she went to the
               ground floor to meet with the firefighters. When she got to the
               ground floor Nicholas R. Townsend (DOB 04-22-97) came up to her
               and said it "sucks someone pulled your fire extinguisher".
               Marsh told me she did not tell anyone else what happened so it
               was odd that he said this to her. Marsh said he specifically
               said the fire extinguisher was pulled, rather than it's weird
               the alarm went off or sprinkler. The two firefighters on scene
               cleared because there was a structure fire at Arby's that had
               been going on they were heading to. I went and spoke to Marsh
               in the study lounge to talk with Townsend. She went on to tell
               me that there is a long list of incident reports for Townsend
               and referred to him as being a prankster. I asked her if they
               have actually caught Townsend in the act of those incidents,
               and she said most the time they either catch him or he admits
               to doing it. I asked Marsh if anybody saw Townsend on their
               floor, and she told me no. I cleared the scene. The
               investigation continues. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 18th day of October,
               2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               the driver seat. He was later identified as Spencer H. Lowder
               (DOB 11-29-96). I asked Lowder if he needed assistance, and he
               said yes. He told me he was unsure what was wrong. I told him I
               had to return to the police department to get the jumper
               cables, but I would be back. I returned shortly and was able to
               jump start Lowder's vehicle. He thanked me, and I cleared the

               10/17/15 at approximately 0100 hours I was driving on Library
               Rd approaching Kimbrough Hall. I shined my spotlight onto the
               roof and saw subjects standing on the roof on the north end of
               the building. There is a large sign with the words "No
               Trepassing on the Roof" located at the south end of the
               building where people access the roof. I parked at Kimbrough
               and Ofc. Westerman arrived on scene. We went onto the roof and
               I found two subject laying on the roof between to walls in a
               feeble attempt to secret themselves from me. I contacted them
               and noticed they both had open Hamms beers and two unopened
               beers. I asked them for ID, which they provided, identifying
               them as Timothy P. Olson 08/21/86 & Jacob B. Logar 06/14/89. I
               escorted them off the roof through the building. As I was
               walking them to the door into the building Logar made the
               comment that we (meaning the police) took the stairs. This made
               it clear to me that they did not access the roof from inside
               the building. I escorted them to my patrol car and issued them
               criminal citations for Trespass II. I explained the citations
               to them, provided them a copy, and told them they were free to
               go. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of

               Samuel T. Marvin 03/28/97 Charges Forwarded MIP Exhibiting 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 10/17/15 at approximately 0122 hours I was
               driving eastbound on Cougar Way near the soccer field when I
               noticed a male, later identified as Samuel Thomas Marvin
               03/28/97, walking eastbound on the sidewalk of Cougar Way.
               Marvin grabbed my attention because as he walked he was
               stumbling side to side taking up the whole width of the
               sidewalk. Marvin was hanging his head in a hunched over fashion
               as he walked. Marvin's lack of balance was a stark contrast to
               the group of five other people he was walking with. As I pulled
               along side of Marvin I noticed he had a dazed look upon his
               face and he appeared to be out of it. Marvin appeared to be
               well under the age of 21. I drove past Marvin and parked on the
               side of the road. I exited my patrol car and walked up to
               Marvin who was now next to Global Scholars Hall. I asked Marvin
               if he had a second to talk and Marvin shook his head no. Marvin
               attempted to walk past me so I grabbed his shirt sleeve and
               told him he was not free to go. I asked Marvin if he had his ID
               with him and he said no. I asked where he was walking to and
               Marvin said Perham Hall. I asked Marvin how old he was and
               Marvin said 17 years old. I told Marvin what I had observed and
               asked him how much he had to drink tonight. Marvin replied,
               "not enough." I told Marvin that I thought he had too much to
               drink tonight. I asked Marvin how many beers he had and Marvin
               said three. I asked Marvin if I could look at his eyes and he
               said I could. I told Marvin to stand with his heels and toes
               together while keeping his hands at his sides. I told Marvin to
               follow the tip of my pen with his eyes only keeping his head
               still. As soon as I moved my pen Marvin moved his head to
               follow it. While attempting my passes, Marvin would not follow
               the pen completely. Instead Marvin was stopping at about my
               shoulder. I had to tell Marvin several times to keep following
               the pen. I stopped the test early because Marvin was no
               following the pen properly. During the test I observed, equal
               pupil size, equal tracking, lack of smooth pursuit, and
               distinct and sustained nysagmus at maximum deviation in both
               eyes. Martin's eyes were bloodshot. Marvin was swaying in all
               directions during the test. I could clearly smell the odor of
               intoxicants coming from his breath as he stood before me. I
               asked Marvin if he was willing to take a voluntary PBT test.

               Marvin said he would. I found my PBT (Alco-Sensor FST #16805)
               in working condition. Marvin provided a PBT sample of .192. I
               again asked Marvin if he had his ID with him and he said no. I
               asked Marvin to provide his name and date of birth verbally.
               Marvin provided his correct name however provided me with a
               date of birth of "06/28/97." I had Intern Roberts run his name
               through dispatch. Dispatch stated there was no return of
               Marvin. While talking to Marvin he pulled out his wallet and
               handed me his WADL. Marvin's ID identified him as 18 years old
               with a date of birth of 03/28/97. I do not believe that Marvin
               was trying to lie about his date of birth, rather he was so
               intoxicated that he could not get it right. I told Marvin that
               I would be forwarding charges of MIP Exhibiting to the
               prosecutor and explained the process. Marvin stated he
               understood. I told Marvin that he was free to go and I cleared.

               a male, later identified as Alex William Dworsky 07/29/96,
               walking northbound on Library Road near Kimbrough Hall.
               Dworsky's back was towards me and I could see that he had a
               large candle stick road cone over his left shoulder. Believing
               that the road cone did not belong to him I decided to stop him
               for investigation of a potential theft. I pulled beside Dworsky
               and he instantly set the road cone down. I exited the car and
               asked Dworsky what he was doing. Dworsky said he was
               "chilling." I asked Dworsky why he was chilling with the road
               cone and Dworsky said, "honestly I have no reason." I asked
               Dworsky for his ID and he provided me with his WADL. Dworsky
               was identified as 19 years old. I asked Dworsky where the cone
               came from and Dworsky said, "honestly I grabbed it from back
               there, there is no reason though." Dworsky had pointed towards
               Terrell Library when he was describing where the cone came
               from. I asked Dworsky what his plan for the cone was and
               Dworsky said, "I thought it would be funny, to bring it to my
               friends." As Dworsky spoke his words were slightly slurred and
               his speech pattern seemed unnatural. I asked Dworsky how much
               he had to drink tonight and Dworsky said, "I haven't." I asked
               Dworsky if I could look at his eyes and he said I could. I told
               Dworsky to stand with his heels and toes together while keeping
               his arms at his sides. I told Dworsky to follow the tip of my
               pen with his eyes only while keeping his head still. During the
               test I observed equal pupil size, equal tracking, lack of
               smooth pursuit, and distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum
               deviation in both eyes. I had Dworsky blow into my hand and I
               could clearly smell the odor of intoxicants coming from his
               breath. I asked Dworsky if he has been contacted by the Police
               before and he said yes. Dworsky had been arrested on 08/25/15
               for MIP Exhibiting and contacted for possession of marijuana on
               09/03/15. I told Dworsky that he was under arrest for theft and
               MIP exhibiting. I advised Dworsky that he was being audio and
               video recorded. Dworsky was searched incident to arrest and
               nothing of evidentiary value was found. Dworsky asked if there
               was a reason why I stopped him and I told Dworsky that I was
               going to read him his Miranda Rights first. I read Dworsky his

               Miranda Rights off my department issued card. When asked if
               Dworsky understood his rights he again asked why he was
               stopped. I asked several times if Dworsky understood his rights
               and he kept asking why he was stopped. I reread Dworsky his
               rights and this time he said he understood his rights. Dworsky
               again asked why he was stopped. I told him that he had just
               stolen the road cone. Dworsky said he did not steal it. I
               explained that the road cone was not his therefore he was not
               allowed to take it with him. I placed Dworsky in the back of my
               patrol car as I filled out a sector citation. Once the citation
               was complete I explained the citation and provided Dworsky with
               his copy. Dworsky was released from custody and told to go
               home. I returned the road cone to it's correct location and
               cleared. END OF REPORT I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 17th day of October,
               2015, in Pullman, Washington.

    Narrative: RVWD:MTK/336 OFC: DBT/321 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5059 SYNOPSIS: Subject reporting
               offensive language written on a door and all over a bulletin
               board in Gannon Hall. No suspects or leads at this time.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 10-17-
               15 at approximately 0224 hours I was dispatched to the report
               of malicious mischief on the fourth floor of Gannon Hall,
               located at 1459 SE Stadium Way. Dispatch advised someone wrote
               profanity on the wall that was directed towards a sorority or
               fraternity. I arrived on scene. I contacted Resident Advisors,
               Jordan A. Munson (DOB 05-04-95), and the Resident Advisor of
               the fourth floor, Alexander H. Svensson (DOB 07-16-96). Munson
               walked over to room 414 and he removed a piece of paper from
               the door. Beneath the piece of paper were the words: "Delts"
               and "Fag" written on the door with black pen. I estimated the
               value of the damage to be $50.00. Next to room 414 was a
               bulletin board with butcher paper covering it with lettering
               titled "What's On Your Bucket List?". There were multiple
               derogatory words and sentences written on the board with black
               pen. I estimated the value of the damage to the bulletin board
               to be $20.00. Svensson told me he put the board up on 10-07-15
               at about 2230 hours for his resident's to write things from
               their bucket list down. He told me he never saw anyone write
               anything on it during the day so he believes most of it
               happened at night. He told me all of the large writing and
               writing on the door happened sometime on 10-17-15 before 0224
               hours. However, he said all of the smaller witting occurred
               throughout the week right after he put it up. Svensson told me
               he did not realize pretty much all of the writing on the board
               was derogatory, until tonight when he read the large writing.
               Some of the things written included the following: "Get with an
               Aphi" "Gannon gets so fucked up though" "Fuck all the MILFS"
               "Put cocaine in her ass" See the photographs to see everything
               else that was written. I asked Munson and Svensson if they knew
               who may had done this, and they both said they had no idea. I
               asked Svensson if he had handwriting he could match up from his
               resident's with the writing on the wall, and he told me
               possibly. However, it appeared multiple people were writing the
               things on the wall. I took photographs, and they were later
               uploaded into Spillman. I cleared the scene. No suspects or
               leads at this time. My Vievu camera was activated, and the
               video was later downloaded into the permanent digital evidence
               folder. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
