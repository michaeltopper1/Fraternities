               Trespassing 2. NARRATIVE: On 10-26-15 at about 0947 hours I was
               dispatched to the report of vagrancy at Stephenson North 13th
               floor lounge. Whitcom advised that the janitor had called about
               a male she found sleeping in the lounge on the 13th floor. The
               13th floor is an all female floor. I responded with Officer
               Olmstead. We went to the 13th floor lounge and opened the door.
               I saw the room was in disarray, with empty food containers on
               the tables and floors, open chip bags, garbage all over the
               place and two laptop computers on the table. I went over to the
               male who was asleep in one of the chairs. I said "hello" and he
               woke up. I asked the male, later identified as Mario A. Gaspar-
               Ayala, what he was doing. He said "sleeping". I asked him
               several questions about where he was and he was able to answer
               them. I asked Gaspar-Ayala where he lives and he said Rogers
               327. Gaspar-Ayala said that he did not go home last night
               because he was studying with his friends who live on the 13th
               floor. I asked if he had ever been contacted by hall staff
               before for trespassing and he said one time he was warned for
               being in the common area of the Stephenson Complex without an
               escort. I warned Gaspar-Ayala about trespassing and asked him
               to clean up the garbage all over the lounge, which he did. I
               then asked Gaspar-Ayala whose computers were on the table. He
               said one was his, which he verified by logging on. He told me
               the other computer belonged to "Alyssa" who lives down the
               hallway. He tried to call her but she did not answer. He showed
               me her room and I knocked on the door, she did not answer. I
               slipped my business card under her door and told her that her
               computer would be at the police department for her to pick up.
               I then escorted Gaspar-Ayala out of the building. I took the
               laptop back to WSUPD and completed the found property report
               form. I was later notified by Evidence Tech Zehm that Alyssa
               had retrieved her computer. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5304 SYNOPSIS: A WSU student said he was
               struck by a car while riding his bicycle in Lot 1. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 10-26-15, at
               approximately 1103 hours, Tyler Joseph Herman (06-25-94) came
               to the WSU Police Department to report a cold, injury accident.
               Herman said he was riding his bicycle from his apartment
               (Chinook Village P-67) to the Stephenson Complex gym to work
               out with the WSU Barbell Club. He said he was riding along the
               right side of level 2 (from the bottom) of the WSU Blue Parking
               Lot #1, when a gray Scion TC stuck him. He said the car hit him
               and he believes he flew over the side of the hood of the car
               and landed on the ground. He was not wearing a helmet at the
               time of the crash, but said he did not hit his head, nor did he
               lose consciousness. I asked him what happened when he got off
               of the ground and he said the female driver of the Scion,
               Melissa Teller, got out of the car and frantically asked him if
               he was ok. He said he was ok. Teller offered to give him a ride
               to the Hospital and he said he did not need to go to the
               Hospital. Teller wrote her contact and Insurance information
               down for Herman and asked him to please keep her in touch.
               Herman said he got back on his bicycle and went to the
               Stephenson Complex gym where he worked out with the WSU Barbell
               Club. He said the club worked out from 0700 till 0800 hours. He
               said they warmed up and then did back squats. After his
               workout, Herman went back to his apartment where he ate
               breakfast. He said he then went to WSU Health and Wellness
               Services. He said his back was still sore and his neck and left
               shoulder were aching. I asked what clothes Herman was wearing
               when he got hit by the car and he said it was the same clothes
               he was currently wearing. He was wearing a black Columbia
               jacket with a lime green interior and red WSU sweat pants. His
               jacket was torn up on the left shoulder area so I took
               photographs of it. I asked him if there was any damage to his
               bicycle and he said he thought his rear wheel was out of true.
               He said he was going to take the bicycle to B&L Bicycles to
               have it looked at and would let me know if there are any
               repairs needed. I asked him if he had any visible injuries and
               he showed me some redness on the inside of his left hand and on
               his left shoulder area. He said he felt an immediate tightness
               in the left middle portion of his back when he got up from the
               ground. He his neck and left shoulder continued getting more
               and more sore as the day went on. I gave Herman my business
               card with his Police case number on it and told him I was going

               Melissa Teller at the phone number Herman gave me for her (951-

               subject locked out of a room in Beasley Coliseum where he
               accidentally left his cell phone. The room was alarmed and I

               rooms are alarmed and that he would need to contact Beasley

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W5311 SYNOPSIS: Report of a subject
               sending self harm photos to an ex-girlfriend. The subject was
               contacted and transported to PRH. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 10/26/15 at about 2100 hrs
               Dispatch advised of a report regarding a subject, Tyler D.
               Frederick, who was sending self harm photos to his ex-
               girlfriend. I responded to Frederick's room, Stephenson North
               921, while Corporal Daniels contacted the reporting party. I
               contacted Frederick at his room and he told me he had been
               arguing with his ex-girlfriend. He told me he had been thinking
               about killing himself earlier but was no longer thinking that.
               I could see he was visibly upset and had been crying. I could
               also see a series of scratches and small cuts on the bicep of
               his left arm. I asked him about the cuts and he told me he did
               them approximately 45 minutes earlier with his desk scissors.
               At about this time Corporal Daniels told me she saw the
               messages Frederick sent to his ex-girlfriend and there was more
               than enough information for protective custody. I asked
               Frederick if he would go to the hospital to speak with a mental
               health professional. He said he would and gathered some items.
               As I was walking out with Frederick Corporal Daniels arrived
               and showed me the screen shots of the messages. In the messages
               Frederick said he might kill himself because of her and that
               "these might be our final minutes together". I transported
               Frederick to PRH and completed an adult protective custody
               form. The protective custody form and messages have been added
               to the case file in Spillman. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               26 day of October, 2015, in Pullman, Washington.

               a lollipop when she began having issues. Pullman Medics arrived
