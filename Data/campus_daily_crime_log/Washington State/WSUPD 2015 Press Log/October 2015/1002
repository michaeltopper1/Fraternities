    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: 316 / Macy WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W4642 SYNOPSIS: Parking Services believed
               they located a stolen vehicle. Determined not to be stolen.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: When
               checking vehicles in the Yellow Lot next to the Beasley
               Coliseum Parking Services believed they located a stolen
               vehicle. In the information received by Parking Services from
               DOL the vehicle, WA/AUM3797, a blue 2003 Jeep Wrangler, showed
               in the "Plate/Vin Flags" section read Plate flags/Centennial
               plate and VIN flags/Stolen vehicle. Whitcom checked the vehicle
               by License and Vin, and the vehicle did not come back as
               stolen. The registered owner, Ryan J. Krastins, met me at the
               vehicle. Ryan showed me his vehicle registration indicating he
               was the owner. Ryan said bought the vehicle in November 2014 in
               Utah when he was in the military. He then moved to Washington,
               transferring his vehicle title to Washington in April 2015.
               Ryan was confused why if it was stolen it would not have shown
               up as stolen when the title was transferred, or when he
               registered it. Ryan had a picture of the Jeep with the previous
               owners license plate, UT/356BL, on the vehicle. Whitcom ran it
               through Utah and everything came up good. Ryan was concerned
               that even when Whitcom ran his vehicle everything was good one
               day he might get stopped, or his vehicle ran, and it might show
               stolen and he would be detained while it was investigated. I
               told Ryan I would try to find an answer for him, and if I did I
               would recontact him. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this ____ day of

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W4651 10/02/15 SYNOPSIS: Unconscious
               female in Stimson Hall room 438. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On October 2, 2015 at about 1403
               hours Pullman Fire and WSU Police were dispatched to an
               unconscious female in Stimson Hall room 438. I responded to the
               room. The male occupant, Austin R. Quane (07/05/97) was on the
               phone with 911 when I arrived. He was crying and visibly
               distraught. The female patient, later identified as Amica V.
               Smith (09/21/95) was lying on the bed. Smith would not respond
               to my verbal commands, She was not responsive. She was
               breathing and had a good steady pulse. Pullman Fire personnel
               soon arrived and evaluated Smith. Smith and Quane are in a
               dating relationship and have been for the past year and a half.
               Quane and I stepped out of the room. He told me that she will
               get upset and then pass out. They had been arguing today and
               she lost consciousness at about 1200 hours. He said it took her
               about an hour before she was responsive. Smith apparently
               mumbled incoherently to Quane and then lost consciousness
               again. Quane finally called 911 at about 1403 hours. He said
               she did not use any drugs or alcohol and is not on any
               medication that he knows of. Quane went on to tell me that last
               night at Smith' apartment they began to verbally fight about
               their relationship. Quane was or is trying to break up with
               Smith. Quane said Smith made comments about suicide and wanting
               to end it. I passed this information on to Pullman Fire
               personnel. Quane said he did not see Smith take anything last
               night or today. He spent the night at her apartment. They ate
               breakfast at the apartment at about 0900 hours. She then drove
               him to Stimson Hall where they remained for the rest of the
               day. Quane wanted Smith to go to the hospital. He did not want
               her left in his room. Smith did not want to go to the hospital
               so Pullman Fire called her roommates to come pick her up. She
               signed a Pullman Fire treatment refusal form. About an hour
               after the time of call Smith walked out of the room with her
               roommates. I gave Quane my business card with resources listed
               on the back of the card. I recommended he speak with WSU
               Counseling Services. WSU Residence Life staff was also on scene
               and documented the incident. The case shall be sent to WSU
               Counseling Services as both Smith and Quane may benefit from
               their services. No further investigation. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W4656 SYNOPSIS: Subject is concerned
               about legal implications involving an aggressive female.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 100215
               at approximately 1602 hours I was dispatched to a threatening
               and the RP was in the lobby. I met with Sulia Garcia (091695)
               in the interview room and told her she was free to leave. She
               started by telling me she was worried about being on probation
               for a domestic violence charge and that a juvenile female in
               the High School Equivalency Program (HEP) was antagonizing her.
               Garcia did not want to give me any names or descriptions. She
               said that another HEP student had recently gone home due to a
               medical complication and several girls blamed her for the
               event. As accusations were made a physical altercation took
               place and Garcia said she was thrown to the floor. She believes
               a video recording was made of the altercation. Garcia told me
               the girl who had assaulted her had been kicked out of the HEP
               program and she was not supposed to be in Orton Hall where the
               event took place. She said program administrators were aware of
               this. Garcia could not specify what it was that she wanted as
               an outcome. I offered to go have a hall discussion, look into
               alternate housing options, etc. She stated she wanted to have
               the person out of the program. Garcia gave me the contact
               information for a Carlos Olivares (112491) who she said works
               with the program. I told her I would follow up with him. I
               provided Garcia with a business card and the case number. We
               talked about avoiding confrontation. She left and I spoke with
               Olivares who turned out to be an RA and he referred me to Lori
               Manzanares (112974). I spoke with Manzanares who was aware of
               some of the situation involving Garcia. She identified the girl
               she believed to be having issues with Garcia as Elsa Arias
               (021098). She said Arias had been kicked out of the HEP program
               and was believed to be residing with some other girls in the
               program at HEP. Regarding the case involving Garcia and Arias,
               that is closed based on the fact that Arias is out of the
               program which was Garcia's only request. I started a related
               case regarding Arias (see case 15-W4657). I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 100215 I was investigating a
               threatening case (see involvements) when I learned that Elsa
               Arias (021098), a juvenile, had been expelled from the High
               School Equivalency Program (HEP) at WSU but she had not been
               returned to her home in Othello. I spoke with the HEP Director,
               Lori Manzanares (112974), who confirmed that Arias had been
               kicked out of the program but believed that Arias was staying
               with friends in other rooms. She said that HEP was leasing
               rooms in Orton from Housing and they had not written a contract
               that prohibited HEP students from having overnight guests. I
               asked about Arias' parents but Manzanares said they had not
               made positive contact with them. Manzanares was not in town but
               was going to have one of her employees, Monica Martinez,
               contact me with more detailed information to track down Arias's
               family. I got a call from RA Carlos Olivera who did not have
               the information I was looking for. I called Martinez and left a
               message. I have not heard back. I then called Othello PD who
               directed me to Adams County Sheriff's office. I requested they
               go to the listed address that both they and I had for Arias. At
               2311 hours I called back to Adams County and learned a deputy
               had attempted contact and would try again the following day.

               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 10-02-15 I was
               dispatched to a hit and run that occurred in the Beasley Lot.
               Dispatch advised that the vehicle had been moved to the R/P's
               residence at Columbia Apartments. I responded to the R/P's
               residence and me her in the parking lot. She stated that at
               1500 hours she parked her vehicle and when she returned to her
               vehicle at 1815 hours the damage was there. The damage was to
               the passenger side front door, rear door and rear quarter
               panel. There was red paint transfer and amount of damage
               appeared to be approximately $1500. I photographed the damage
               and later downloaded them into Spillman. I asked The R/P if she
               saw any red vehicles where she parked at. She said there was
               but didn't see any damage to them. I told her I would go
               through the parking lot and check again. I told her that there
               was no cameras in the area and therefore there was no way to
               find the suspect vehicle. She said she understood. I gave her
               the case number and told her if she had any questions to give
               me a call. She said she would and I left the area. I drove to
               the Beasley lot. I checked all the red vehicles in the area,
               but none of them had matching damage. There are no leads or
               suspects at this time................ I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of

               2. NARRATIVE: On 10-02-15 at approximately 2315 hours I was
               dispatched to the report of a suspicious person at the Fine
               Arts Building, located at 1615 NE Wilson Rd. Dispatch advised
               the complainant, Paula H. Dewolf (DOB 06-14-56), who is a
               custodian in the building said she saw a male enter the
               building. She advised he entered through the fourth floor doors
               by the loading dock. She advised he should not be in the
               building. Dispatch advised the complainant described the
               individual as a tall white, male wearing dark pants and a grey
               hooded sweatshirt with the hood covering his head. She also
               said the male was wearing a backpack. Sgt. Kuhrt, Ofc.
               Westerman, and I arrived on scene. We had a couple Cougar
               Security Units on perimeter outside. Sgt. Kuhrt waited near the
               stairwells in the Fine Arts Parking Garage. Ofc. Westerman and
               I searched the Fine Arts Building. We eventually found a male
               asleep on a bench on the fifth floor. He was later identified
               as Krystopher G. Beiro (DOB 04-17-76). Eventually Beiro woke
               up, and we were able to speak with him. I asked him what he was
               doing in the building, and he said he was waiting for his ride.
               I asked him where his ride was at, and he said they are at The
               Bookie. I again asked him what he was doing in the building
               because the building is closed. I asked Beiro how he got in the
               building, and he told me he went through the front door that
               was unlocked. Beiro asked me what the problem was, and I told
               him he was trespassing and not supposed to be in the building
               right now. I asked Beiro when he entered the building, and he
               said probably 2200 hours or 2300 hours. Beiro is homeless and
               said he is in Pullman because his 13 year old daughter lives
               here. Sgt. Kuhrt asked if Beiro is a WSU student, and he said
               no. He then asked him if he works on campus, and he said no.
               Beiro said he use to work in Hillside though on campus. Sgt.
               Kuhrt asked him if his purpose for coming into the building was
               to sleep, and he said no. Beiro again said he was in the
               building to wait for his ride. He explained to him that did not
               make any sense because he would not know when his ride arrived

               if the building was locked. Sgt. Kuhrt asked Beiro what time he
               got here, and he replied 2100 hours or 2200 hours. Earlier
               Beiro said he got there at 2200 hours or 2300 hours. Sgt. Kuhrt
               told Beiro he was under arrest for criminal trespass. I
               handcuffed Beiro (double locked). Sgt. Kuhrt advised Beiro he
               was being audio and video recorded, and about his right to
               counsel. I searched Beiro incident to arrest. Sgt. Kuhrt read
               Beiro his Constitutional Rights from his department issued
               Miranda Warning card. Beiro said he understood his rights, and
               he would be willing to talk with us. I asked Beiro how much he
               had to drink because I could smell the strong odor of
               intoxicants coming from his breath as I was searching him.
               Beiro replied he had nothing to drink. Sgt. Kuhrt saw a Cougar
               Card Maxx that I took off of Beiro belonging to a "Daniel
               Joseph Kuhta". He asked Beiro about it and he told him he found
               the Cougar Card Maxx by the Old Bookie on campus. He also had a
               high school identification card belonging to a "Yamonee
               Rhodes", that he also said he found by the Old Bookie. I placed
               Beiro in the back of my patrol vehicle. I transported him to
               Pullman Police Department where he was fingerprinted,
               photographed, cited, and released. The investigation continues.
               My Vievu camera was activated, and the video was later
               downloaded into the permanent digital evidence folder. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 5th day of October, 2015, in Pullman,

               occurred on the 3rd floor of Streit Hall. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Taylor A. Hogue 02/25/96 Suspect 2.
               Samuel Radcliffe (unknown further) Possible victim NARRATIVE:
               On 10/03/15 at approximately 0015 I responded to Perham Hall
               for an unconscious subject due to an alcohol overdose. While
               dealing with the patient, Taylor A. Hogue, I learned that he
               was in a fight approximately 2 hours earlier in Streit Hall on
               the 3rd floor. One of the RA's on duty, Julie A. Johnson, told
               me that she was called to the 3rd floor of Streit by the RA of
               that floor, Anisha D. Sheth, for an unruly guest (Hogue). I
               asked Johnson to get in touch with Sheth and we could meet in
               the lobby, which we did. I asked Sheth what happened. Sheth
               said she heard a commotion in the hallway and went to check on
               it. Sheth said that Hogue was out in the hallway banging on
               doors and slamming the lounge door. Sheth said Hogue was
               visiting from out of town with his friends Samuel Radcliffe and
               Brett Bustad. Sheth said Hogue was staying in room 322 which
               belongs to Selena Tyler and Paige Cook. Sheth said that while
               Hogue was in the hallway Radcliffe came out and attempted to
               calm Hogue down and get him out of the building. Hogue
               continued to yell and at this point Sheth called Johnson to
               notify her of the situation. Sheth said that Hogue and
               Radcliffe exited to the area near the elevator. Sheth said at
               this point she did not go out with them and Johnson showed up.
               I asked Johnson what she saw. Johnson said when she came into
               the elevator area she saw Hogue on the ground. Johnson said
               Hogue was yelling at Radcliffe and she said that Radcliffe
               looked "confused". Johnson said Radcliffe was telling Hogue to
               stand up, which he did and then they went into the stairwell
               where Hogue continued to yell at Radcliffe. Johnson said Hogue
               got into Radcliffe's face and then "started go after him".
               Johnson said Radcliffe got pinned up against the wall and got
               Hogue into a "choke hold". Johnson said another resident, later
               identified as Stephen Hopkins, was in the stairwell and was
               trying to pull Hogue off of Radcliffe. At this point everyone
               left. I asked Johnson if Hogue had a banged up head when she
               saw him and she said that he did. I asked Sheth if she noticed
               Hogue's head banged up and she said he didn't look "beaten up".
               I went to room 236 of Streit knocked on the door. A male
               subject (Hopkins) answered the door and I spoke with him in the
               lounge area. I asked Hopkins to tell me what happened. Hopkins
               said he was coming home and walking up the stairwell when he

               heard yelling coming from the 3rd floor. Hopkins said that when
               he got to the area of the 3rd floor he heard a male say "get
               the fuck out of my face" and heard another male say "you won't
               hit me". Hopkins then saw two males, Hogue and Radcliffe, go
               into the elevator area and "start fighting". Hopkins said he
               grabbed a hold of Hogue and tried to pull him off of Radcliffe.
               Hopkins said he was able to get Hogue off of Radcliffe and then
               walked him outside to calm him down and to get him out of the
               building. Hopkins said Hogue said he needed to get his friend
               from the building so he walked him back up to the 3rd floor and
               then realized it wasn't a good idea to let him back in so when
               he walked in, he let the door close behind him, locking Hogue
               out of the floor. Hopkins said another male walked out at this
               time and walked Hogue out. I asked if Hogue and Radcliffe
               exchanged blows and he said no. Hopkins said it was more of a
               wrestling match. I asked Hopkins if he was hit and injured and
               he said no. Hopkins then said he was elbowed in the nose, but
               wasn't injured. I asked Hopkins if the name Brett or Samuel
               sounded familiar. Hopkins said he heard Hogue saying the name
               Brett, but other than that he did not know the other names. I
               went to room 322, but no one was home. Investigation continues.
               I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws
               of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 4th day of October, 2015, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer

               approximately 0040 hours I saw a group of minors I knew to be
               intoxicated after seeing them inside Perham Hall. They were
               near sitting on a bench outside Einsein's Bagels. I parked
               closer to Bohler Gym and walked back to where they had been
               sitting. When I got there they were gone. Behind me, near the
               east entrance to the bagel shop, I heard a loud crashing sound
               and saw Zachary R. Nelson (050995) had fallen down amongst
               several chairs. He was being assisted up and into a chair by a
               bystander. Nelson appeared to be under the age of 21. He sat at
               a nearby table and eagerly ate his pizza. I walked over and
               could smell the odor of intoxicants coming from Nelson's breath
               as he breathed heavily. He had water eyes that had a pink hue
               to them. He confirmed he had been drinking R&R Whiskey and that
               he had 3/4 of a bottle in his backpack. I had him stand and I
               checked his eyes. I observed a lack of smooth pursuit and
               distinct and sustained nystagmus in both eyes. Nelson had
               dropped a knife when he fell and I slid it aside with my foot.
               I asked him to take the whiskey out of his backpack. He took
               his backpack off and placed it on the ground, deciding not to
               get the alcohol out. I offered him a PBT and he declined.
               Nelson had slurred speech. I placed him under arrest for MIP,
               advised him of his right to an attorney, and notified him that
               he was being audio and visually recorded. I later learned my
               Vievue had not been activated and notified Sgt. Griffin who had
               arrived as backup. Once I noticed this I activated the camera.
               He was placed in handcuffs and taken to my patrol car where he
               was searched incident to arrest. Nelson was placed in the back
               of my patrol car while I completed Sector Citation #5Z1038279.
               He was also read Miranda had this time. Nelson was issued his
               citation and released. His alcohol was not seized. We cleared.
               Nothing follows. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 3rd day of September, 2015, in

               hours I was dispatched to a drugs call at Wilmer Davis Hall
               room 315. Upon arrival I met with Timothy Martin who was the
               RED on duty. Martin stated there was a couple of people in room
               315 and it smelled of marijuana. As I was walking towards the
               room two females exited. The females were later identified as
               Isabella R. Montoya 01/13/97 and Sarah E. Crane 08/11/97.
               Montoya was holding a small black trash bag in her hand. I told
               the two why I had been called to their room and I asked for
               their ID's. Montoya stated she lived in room 315. Crane said
               she was visiting for the weekend and she goes to Montana State
               University. I told the two, as long as they were willing to
               turn over all their marijuana, smoking devices, and other
               illegal items, we would go destroy them, and they would only be
               referred to student conduct. Both agreed to my proposal.
               Montoya said the stuff was inside the trash bag that she was
               going to get rid of anyway. Montoya said she was not the one
               who had been smoking but rather it was people who were staying
               with her for the weekend. I told Montoya that she was still
               responsible for what was in her room. We walked to the dumpster
               outside where she threw away several empty bottles of hard
               alcohol and a marijuana pipe. I explained the student conduct

               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 10/03/15 at
               approximately 0209 hours Cougar Security units notified me that
               they fresh graffiti in the Zen Room Stairwell. I responded and
               found numerous taggings from the 1st-5th floors. I also located
               the word "no" on the wall of the 1st floor of the parking
               garage outside of the Zen room door. All doors to the stairwell
               were secured. I found shoe prints coming from the 7th floor
               entrance from inside the facility. The shoe prints were
               consistent with those I've seen from Vans or similar skater
               type shoes. I took photos of some of the graffiti and video of
               the rest since there was so much. I saved the photos and video
               to the case. The graffiti occurred after 2300 hours on
               10/02/15. WSUPD was at the Fine Arts building for a trespassing
               call and I was at the Zen Room and the graffiti was not there
               at that time. In order for the suspect to have entered the Zen
               Room they would have had to trespass in the Fine Arts building
               after hours to access the stairwell. No suspects or leads. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 3rd day of October, 2015, in Pullman,

               theft at Rogers Hall, located at 1355 SE Olympia Ave. Dispatch
               advised the complainant, Justeen A. Montelongo (DOB 11-09-91),
               said a couple of Resident Advisors would meet me in the lobby
               of Rogers Hall for contact. I arrived on scene. I contacted a
               couple of the Resident Advisors in the lobby. They told me the
               damage to the bulletin board occurred on the second floor. We
               took the elevator up to the second floor. The bulletin board in
               front of the elevators when you exit had multiple papers torn
               from it and laying on the floor. We made a right and there was
               another bulletin board with a few papers that were torn from
               it. They said it occurred sometime between 0000 hours on 10-03-
               15 and 0210 hours on 10-03-15. I estimated the damage to the
               bulletin boards to be $20.00. The men's restroom on the second
               floor also had it's garbage can lid stolen. It was cream in
               color and I estimated it to be $20.00. They walked me to the
               north entrance of Rogers Hall. There were a couple of empty
               milkshake cups that had been thrown against the nearby window.
               There was milkshake on the window and some on the floor. One
               cup had the name "Chase" written on it, and the other cup said
               "Michael". The Resident Advisors said those milkshake cups had
               been sitting near the bottom of the stairs for the last couple
               of days. I took photographs of all the damage, and they were
               later uploaded into Spillman. I cleared the scene. No suspects
               or leads at this time. My Vievu camera was activated, and the
               video was later downloaded into the permanent digital evidence
               folder. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under

               approximately 0233 hours I was driving northbound on Library
               Mall when I spotlighted the roof of Kimbrough Hall. I could see
               what appeared to be someone sitting near the top edge of the
               roof. Sgt. Kuhrt and I went up to the roof where I found Thais
               Pires 06/25/92 and Konstantin A. Andrushenko 11/07/93 having
               sex. I identified myself as a Police Officer and told them to
               put their clothes on. Once Andrushenko and Pires were dressed I
               walked closer. I told the two to gather their belongings and we
               would leave the roof together. While walking to the roof exit I
               asked the two if they had seen the large "NO TRESPASSING" sign
               on the wall they climbed to gain access to the roof. Both said
               no. Once we were in the building I told the two that they were
               under arrest for criminal trespass and handcuffed (D/L) them.
               Both were advised they were being audio and video recorded. I
               read both their Miranda Rights off my department issued card.
               Both stated they understood their rights and having them in
               mind still wished to speak to me. Sgt. Kuhrt and I walked the
               two out to my patrol car where I issued them Sector citations
               for RCW 9A.52.080 Criminal Trespassing 2nd Degree. I explained
               the citation to both and provided them with their copies. I
               answered questions for the two for several minutes and cleared.
