               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W2640 SYNOPSIS: Assisted Pullman PD with
               a juvenile riding his bicycle on SR 270 near Bishop Blvd. Case
               handled by Officer Emerson. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 05-26-16 at about 1055 hours I
               had just cleared physical therapy and was approaching SR 270 on
               Bishop Blvd when I saw an elementary school aged male riding a
               bicycle eastbound on the shoulder of 270. It looked like he had
               just turned off of Bishop onto 270. I stopped at the red
               traffic light and looked to the east and did not see the
               juvenile. I thought he had ridden back down to the Chipman
               Trail. I turned westbound onto Main/270 and looked in my
               rearview mirror and saw a white compact car pulled to the
               shoulder and a male walking eastbound after the bicyclist. I
               then saw a red compact pull up and a female get out and walk
               towards both the male and the bicyclist. I turned around and
               pulled up behind both vehicles. The male in the while vehicle
               was a Pullman Reserve, Lambert I believe and the female was
               counselor. As I began to talk to them Whitcom dispatched a
               welfare check call to the same area involving the juvenile on
               the bike. I told Whitcom I was on scene and would wait for PPD
               to arrive. Officer Emerson arrived a short time later and the
               scene was turned over to him. I cleared. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 26th____ day of __May___________, 2016, in

               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #:16-W2649 SYNOPSIS: Athena C. Ogden
               called and requested a welfare check on Michael Alfredson. I
               contacted Alfredson by phone and found he was in Tacoma.
               Computer Report. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 05-27-16 at about 0010 hours, while on duty for
               the WSU Police Department, Whitcom advised of a welfare check
               at Nez Perce Apartments #Q69, located at 1445 NE North Fairway
               Rd. The complainant, Athena C. Ogden, was calling from
               Bremerton WA and requesting a welfare check for her friend,
               Michael Alfredson. Ogden reported that Alfredson called her and
               said he was outside his girlfriend's house in Pullman and he
               wasn't making any sense. Ogden reported that Alfredson told her
               everyone is a cop, and they are keeping him from his
               girlfriend. Ogden said Alfredson's girlfriend is Jessica D.
               Taylor, but she doesn't know Taylor's address. Whitcom checked
               Jessica D. Taylor in Spillman and found Taylor's last known
               address was Nez Perce Apartment Q69. I was familiar with
               Michael Alfredson from our patrol briefing at the beginning of
               my graveyard shift. Officer Whitman advised that Alfredson's
               relatives had called and said Michael was not taking his
               medication and WSU Counseling Services should be notified of
               any contacts with Michael. Upon arriving at the Nez Perce
               Apartments, Whitcom advised that Alfredson told Ogden that he
               was sitting in his vehicle, a black sports car, in the parking
               lot of Taylor's house. I had Whitcom check for a vehicle
               associated with Alfredson and they advised he owns a black 2003
               Toyota Celica, WA license plate AAB5355. I checked the parking
               lot of Nez Perce Apartments and did not locate the vehicle. I
               approached apartment Q69 and saw there were no lights on at the
               apartment. I stood by the front door and could not hear any
               noise coming from the apartment. I knocked on the door to
               apartment Q69 several times and did not get an answer. I
               checked the rest of the Nez Perce parking lot, but did not
               locate Alfredson or his vehicle. I had Officer Petlovany and
               Sgt Kuhrt check the parking lots of the Marriott hotel on N
               Fairway Rd and the Chief Joe Apartment complex. They did not
               locate Alfredson or his vehicle. I returned to my patrol
               vehicle and attempted to contact the complainant, Athena C.
               Ogden by phone, but it went straight to voicemail. I cleared
               from the Nez Perce apartments and drove to the Palouse Ridge
               Golf Course parking lot, but did not locate Alfredson or his
               vehicle. Whitcom provided me with Jessica D. Taylor's phone
               number, but when I called it went straight to voicemail. I

               called the complainant, Athena C. Ogden again and she answered.
               Ogden told me the following: She lives in Bremerton, WA and she
               called her friend, Michael Alfredson, who told her that
               "Everyone is a cop and they are not allowing him to see his
               girlfriend". She told me this behavior is not normal for
               Alfredson and she saw him about a week ago and he told her he
               was turning his life around and was doing good. I asked what
               Alfredson was referring to when he said he was turning his life
               around and Ogden said he has battled with depression in the
               past. Ogden told me she is just concerned about Alfredson and
               this behavior is not normal for him. She said Alfredson is not
               answering her phone calls now. I asked if she had Alfredson's
               girlfriends number and she said she did not. She then provided
               me with Alfredson's phone number. I told Ogden that if
               Alfredson contacts her she needs to find out where he is and
               call me back and let me know. Ogden told me she would contact
               me if she spoke with Alfredson. I attempted to contact Jessica
               D. Taylor, by phone, but she did not answer. I contacted
               Michael Alfredson by phone and he told me the following: He was
               sitting in the parking lot of his girlfriend's house because
               they just broke up and he wanted to get some closure, but he is
               unable to make contact with her. I told him that people were
               concerned about him and I wanted to contact him in person to
               check on him. I asked Alfredson to tell me exactly where he was
               and he told me I know where he is. I told Alfredson I did not
               know where he was and he said "I am next to the brown bear". I
               told him I did not know where the Brown Bear was and he said it
               is by his girlfriend's house. Alfredson then continued to
               explain that he had driven 6 hours to try and talk to Taylor
               because he wanted some closure about their relationship. I
               asked him what city he was in and he said Tacoma. I asked him
               if he was at the Nez Perce apartments and he said no. He told
               me Taylor kicked him out of the apartment even though he pays
               Taylor's bills and rent for the apartment. I asked Alfredson if
               he was ok and what his plans were for the night. He told me he
               was ok, but wants to speak with Taylor about their
               relationship. He told me didn't know what he was going to do
               tonight, but would probably have to sleep in his car. I asked
               what car he was driving and he told me a black Hyundai tiburon.
               I asked if there was anything I could do for him tonight and he
               said to have Taylor talk to him. I told him I would try and
               speak with Taylor. I thanked Alfredson for his time and told
               him to have a goodnight. Alfredson told me I had ruined his
               night. I had Whitcom run Jessica D. Taylor's name which showed
               her residence was in Tacoma. I called Whitcom and asked them to
               call Tacoma Police Dispatch and notify them of Alfredson's
               location and have them contact him. I called the complainant,
               Athena C. Ogden, and left her a voicemail explaining I had
               spoken with Alfredson and he told me he was in Tacoma. I let
               her know Tacoma Police were going to try and locate him. I
               forwarded this report to WSU Counseling services. Computer
               Report. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
