        Complainant: WHITFIELD, KOURTNIE R
                     880 NE PROVIDENCE CT; R303, PULLMAN, WA  99163

    Narrative: RVWD: AE/330 OFC:MTK/336 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #:16-W0257 SYNOPSIS: 4 vehicles damaged along
               Spokane St. No suspects or leads. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 01/17/16 at approximately 0945
               hours Whitcom dispatched me to a malicious mischief on SE
               Spokane St. at Dana Hall. I responded and met with the
               reporting party, Kourtnie Whitfield. Whitfield pointed out her
               vehicle (WA AKD4944) had been damaged. I found the two
               passenger side windows broken out as well as a hole in the
               front windshield. There were two other dents on the windshield
               as well. The molding above the back passenger door was bent up
               from the car. I photographed the damage to the car. I asked
               Whitfield when she parked her car there and she said around
               2230 hours the night before. Whitfield said there was nothing
               missing from her vehicle. I provided Whitfield with my business
               card and case number and she drove her vehicle from the scene.
               The vehicle (WA 642ZWN) parked behind Whitfield's vehicle was
               also damaged. I noticed the front windshield was dented as well
               as the front passenger window and the window on the passenger
               side sliding door were broken out. The front cover of the
               driver's mirror was broken off and the mirror was pushed
               forward (although it was still intact). I noticed damage to the
               front bumper by the license plate and saw what I thought was a
               metal rod sticking out of the bumper. I pulled on the rod which
               came out and was leaking red fluid (presumably transmission
               fluid). As I was photographing the vehicle, the local operator,
               Paloma Betrisey, arrived on scene. I pointed out the damage to
               Betrisey and she confirmed the damage was not previously there.
               I asked her when she parked her vehicle there and she said the
               day before. I further inspected the area behind the front
               bumper and determined the metal rod was actually a fluid line
               that was broken from the impact of breaking the bumper. The
               line was pulled out so it was sticking out of the front of the
               bumper. I found a large amount of red fluid that had leaked
               from the car. I suggested Betrisey call her insurance company
               and get her vehicle towed as I did not know if it was safe for
               her to drive it, which she did. Betrisey said there was nothing
               missing from the vehicle. I provided Betrisey my business card
               and case number. I located two other vehicles with damage to
               them parked further north along Spokane St near Dana Hall. The
               next vehicle (WA ARK3810) I located had the front passenger
               window broken out as well as the passenger mirror destroyed. I
               contacted the local operator and registered owner, Katherine
               Taylor. I told Taylor about the damage to her vehicle and she

               arrived on scene. Taylor verified nothing appeared to be
               missing from her vehicle. I photographed the damage to the
               vehicle and provided Taylor with my business card and case
               number. Taylor drove her vehicle from the scene. The vehicle
               (WA AJL2851) parked behind Taylor's vehicle had a broken
               passenger side mirror, a scratch to the passenger side a-
               pillar, and a small dent on the back passenger side door. I
               noticed scratches to both passenger side windows, but they
               appeared as if they would come off. I photographed the damage
               to the vehicle and called the local operator and registered
               owner, Ryan Kim. Kim was inside the engineering buildings and
               came out to his vehicle. I provided Kim with my business card
               and case number. I told Kim to contact me if the windows had to
               be repaired. I checked the area for any signs of a tool that
               was used or other items of evidentiary value, but could not
               locate anything. Other nearby lots were checked, but no other
               damaged vehicles were located. There are no suspects or leads
               at this time. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 17th day of January, 2016, in
               Pullman, Washington. _______________________________________

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0258 SYNOPSIS: An unleashed dog was
               scaring deer at the WSU Wild Ungulate Facility. I contacted the
               owner who said her dog got lose while she was walking. I

               NARRATIVE: On 01-17-16, Autumn W. Tendler (11-06-94) called
               Whitcom from the WSU Wild Ungulate Facility. She said an
               unleashed dog was running near the fence causing the deer to
               become scared. I responded to the WSU Wild Ungulate Facility
               and contacted Tendler. She said the brown dog left the area
               shortly after she called Whitcom. I asked her which direction
               the dog went and she said she thought she heard a woman call
               the dog and it ran up and over a hill. She pointed in the
               direction of Highway 270. I left the area and went to the USDA
               Facility near Highway 270 and found a woman walking with 2
               dogs, one of which was brown. I asked the woman; later
               identified as Tammy K. Crawford (08-22-62), if her dog had been
               near the WSU Wild Ungulate Facility recently. She said she was
               not sure, but said the dog did run away from her when she began
               walking. I advised her she needed to keep her dogs leashed
               while walking them in the area. Nothing further. I certify and

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Olmstead/339 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0261 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched to a
               report of a malicious mischief at Regents Hall. The complainant
               reported that someone had shot three holes in a window with a
               pellet gun. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 01-17-2016 at about 1613 hrs I was dispatched to
               a report of a malicious mischief in Regents Hall, located at
               1580 NE Cougar Way. Sergeant Griffin and I arrived on scene and
               contacted Joseph M. Lloyd (DOB 02-29-1996) and Acacia L.
               Kapusta (DOB 08-25-1989). Lloyd is a resident advisor for
               Stephenson South, and Kapusta is the hall director for
               Northside Residence Hall. Lloyd and Kapusta told me the
               following: The exterior window located at the end of the 4th
               floor hallway, near room #483, and at the edge of the northeast
               corner of Regents hall had been shot one time with a pellet gun
               this weekend. For more information, see related case #16-W0247.
               Another window on this same side of Regents Hall, but on the
               1st floor, had been shot with a pellet gun earlier last week.
               For more information, see related case #16-W0217. Both of these
               windows face the west side of the Northside Residence Hall.
               Lloyd and Kapusta reported that on 01-17-2016 between 1500 hrs
               and 1600 hrs the same window that was damaged earlier on the
               4th floor of Regents Hall was shot an additional three times
               with a pellet gun. The damage is estimated to be $315.00. Lloyd
               and Kapusta also reported that on 01-17-2016 between 1620 hrs
               and 1625 hrs they were waiting for police officers to arrive in
               the 4th floor landing of Regents Hall. They heard a loud pop
               and realized something had just struck the wooden door at the
               entrance to the 4th floor hallway. While I was speaking with
               Lloyd and Kapusta, Sergeant Griffin was examining the scene.
               Sergeant Griffin located a total of four holes in the exterior
               window at the end (northeast corner) of the 4th floor hallway.
               It is believed that three of the holes occurred today before we
               arrived on scene. Sergeant Griffin recovered four metal pellets
               from the floor of the hallway. Sergeant Griffin examined the
               wooden door at the entrance to the 4th floor hallway. Sergeant
               Griffin estimated that the wooden door was located about 150
               feet down the narrow hallway (west) from the damaged window.
               Sergeant Griffin did not observe any fresh damage on the door,
               however, he located one pellet on the floor near the door. The
               pellets were all silver in color and were smashed, apparently
               from being fired from a gun and then hitting the window and/or
               door. I collected the five pellets Sergeant Griffin had
               located, and they were later logged into property as evidence.

               Sergeant Griffin photographed the scene, and the photographs
               were downloaded into Spillman and attached to this case.
               Sergeant Griffin and I speculated that someone had been
               shooting a pellet gun towards Regents Hall from a room located
               on the west side of the Northside Residence Hall. Based on the
               positioning of the two buildings, and the fact that one of the
               pellets had somehow travelled the length of the hallway and
               struck the wooden door, we believed it was most likely that the
               person was shooting from a room on the 3rd or 4th floor of the
               Northside Residence Hall. Sergeant Griffin and I responded to
               the Northside Residence Hall and contacted numerous residents
               who resided on the west side of the building and on the 3rd and
               4th floors. None of the residents provided any additional
               information about the pellet gun incidents. After speaking with
               residents in the Northside Residence Hall and viewing the
               layout of the rooms, Sergeant Griffin and I identified four
               rooms as being in the best position for someone to have used a
               pellet gun to damage the windows in Regents Hall. The rooms
               were identified as 382A, 382B, 482A, and 482B. Sergeant Griffin
               and I identified the residents of room 382B as: Jacob C.
               Nienhuis (DOB 09-20-1996) and Adam O. Possing (DOB 01-01-1997).
               We identified the residents of room 482B as: Piers N. Stranberg
               (DOB 01-27-1997) and Matt T. Davis (DOB 03-11-1997). Sergeant
               Griffin and I contacted and interviewed all of these
               individuals, and none of them provided any information about
               the pellet gun incidents. Investigation continues. Olmstead/339
               I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws

               found in a residence hall room. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1.Venegas, Marivel A. 082296 Warned Possession of
               Marijuana 2. NARRATIVE: On 01-17-16 I was dispatched to
               Stephenson East for a found property call. Shortly after the
               call came out I was called to higher priority call. About an
               hour later I responded to Stephenson East. I contacted the R/A.
               She stated Jasmine Pacheco who lives in 411 came to her room.
               She told her that after her old roommate, later identified as
               Marivel Venegas, moved out she found a small baggie of
               marijuana on her side of the room. The R/A called the police.
               The R/A stated that while she was waiting for me to arrive
               Venegas came back to the room to clean. Pacheco told Venegas
               that she had called the police about the marijuana. According
               to the R/A Venegas denied the marijuana was hers and said that
               Pacheco was trying to set her up for the drugs. Venegas grabbed
               the marijuana and left the room. I went to 411 and knocked on
               the door, but there was no answer. I called her on her cell and
               left a message. As of the time of this report I have not
               received a call back. I told the R/A that if Pacheco came back
               to have her contact me. I asked where Venegas moved to and she
               said Streit 110. I thanked her and left the hall. I went to
               Streit Hall and attempted to contact Venegas. She was not home
               so I left a message with her roommate to call me. About an hour
               later Venegas called dispatch and left her number. I called her
               back and she told me that she went back to her room to pick up
               her vacuum and hermit crab. When she got there Pacheco showed
               her the drugs and told her she had called the police. Venegas
               said the drugs weren't hers and asked why Pacheco was trying to
               set her up. She didn't answer her just told her to wait for the
               police. Venegas fearing she would get in trouble. Grabbed the
               rest of her personal items and the marijuana and left the
               building. I asked where the marijuana was and she said she
               threw them in the dumpster outside the hall. She asked if she
               was in trouble and I told her as long as she threw the drugs
               out I would not me referring the case to student conduct. I
               gave her some advice about dealing with the former roommate.
               She thanked me and I told her that she needed to observe the
               current laws concerning the possession and use of marijuana.
               She said she understood and we ended the call. I attempted to
               call Pacheco again and left a message. Case closed pending more
               information concerning this case is received.. I certify and

               SYNOPSIS: Subject reported a cold hit and run collision that
               occurred on Stadium Way at East Main St. DRIVER 1: Unknown
               DRIVER 2: Ryan P. Steele VEHICLE 2: Red 2003 Ford Focus
               INSURANCE: Farmers Insurance #186031655 DAMAGE: White paint
               transfer to the rear bumper NARRATIVE: On 01/17/16 at about
               2100 hrs Dispatch advised of a report of a cold hit and run
               collision that was holding. I contacted the complainant, Ryan
               P. Steele (042696), who told me he was stopped for the stop
               light on Stadium Way at east main in the right hand lane. While
               he was waiting a white Toyota Camry hit his vehicle from behind
               hard enough that the back of his head hit the seat head rest.
               He thought if he had not been wearing his seatbelt his head may
               have hit the steering wheel. The light changed and Steele
               pulled into the Sellas Parking lot and the other car "took off"
               driving eastbound on East Main. Steele did not see where the
               vehicle went or what kind of license plates it had. He said
               there was a white male driving the vehicle and a white female
               passenger in the vehicle. I asked Steele if there was any
               damage to his vehicle and he said only paint transfer. He told
               me his head hurt from hitting the head rest and he was at the
               hospital to get evaluated. I told him to call me and leave a
               message if necessary to let me know if the hospital determined
               he received any injuries from the collision. I went to Steele's
               apartment at Nez Pierce and located his vehicle. I photographed
               the paint transfer on the rear bumper of his vehicle. The
               photos were added to the case file. No suspects or leads at
               this time. More to follow. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 18 day of January,

               damaged wall, door name tags torn down, and a bulletin board
               torn down in Rogers Hall. Suspect admitted to causing the
               damage to the officer. Suspect will be referred to WSU Student

               White/09-20-96 Warned/Student Malicious Mischief 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 01-17-16 at approximately 2102 hours I was dispatched to the
               report of malicious mischief at Rogers Hall 8th floor, located
               at 1355 SE Olympia Ave. Dispatch advised the complainant,
               Nathan S. Gleaton (DOB 10-22-95), was reporting a hole in the
               wall, door name tags torn down, and a bulletin board torn down.
               Dispatch said the possible suspect is named "Johnny" and lives
               in room #839. I arrived on scene. I met Gleaton and Joshua D.
               Feikes (DOB 10-28-94) in the 8th floor elevator lobby. Both
               Gleaton and Feikes were the Resident Advisor's on duty. The
               bulletin board in the 8th floor elevator lobby had butcher
               paper torn from it. I estimated the damage to the bulletin
               board to be $20.00. I asked when they discovered the damage,
               and they said they saw it on 01-17-16 around 2045 hours.
               Gleaton told me the RA of the 8th floor and other resident's of
               the floor believe the damaged occurred around 0500 hours on 01-
               17-16. I asked them why they thought "Johnny" had caused the
               damage. Gleaton told me there were resident's that saw him
               walking through the floor earlier this morning, and that he was
               extremely intoxicated. I asked them if I may speak to a few
               resident's that had seen Johnny cause the damage, and they said
               yeah. We walked down the 8th floor hallway. There was a hole in
               the wall to the right of room #835. The hole was approximately
               2 feet x 2 feet. There was debris from the wall on the carpet.
               I estimated the damage to the wall to be $200.00. Towards the
               end of the hall there were six (6) door name tags laying on the
               ground. They were blue and orange in color and had a different
               resident's name on each one. I estimated the value of the door
               name tags to be $10.00. I took photographs of all the damage,
               and the photos were later uploaded into Spillman. Gleaton and
               Feikes knocked on room #835 to see if one of the resident's
               could tell me how the damaged occurred. A male later identified
               as Evan D. Klewin (DOB 05-28-97) answered the door. Klewin said
               he knew what happened and agreed to come out in the hallway and
               speak with me. Klewin said he woke up around 0500 on 01-17-16
               to loud bangs. He said there was yelling in the room next door
               to him in room #839. He said the yelling and slams lasted about
               45 minutes. He said when he went out in the hallway this

               morning he saw the hole in the wall and all of the name tags
               ripped off of the doors. I asked him about what time he noticed
               the damage, and he said around 0545 hours. I asked Klewin to
               describe the yelling he heard coming from #839, and he said
               people arguing back and forth. I asked him if he knew the
               resident's that lived in #839, and he told me he knows Johnny.
               He said he recognized Johnny's voice as being one of the people
               yelling. I walked down to room #839, and knocked on the door. A
               female later identified as Chloe J. Krois (DOB 03-10-97). I
               asked if Johnny was there, and she said no she thinks he is at
               his fraternity right now. Krois told me she is Johnny's friend
               and staying with him for a few days. I asked Krois if she knew
               how the damage happened in the hallway, and she said she had no
               idea. I gave Krois my business card with my phone number and
               asked her to tell Johnny to give me a call. I cleared the
               scene. I returned to the station, and I received a phone call
               from Johnny. I asked him if he was back in his dorm room, and
               he said yes. I asked if I may and come speak with him, and he
               said that would be okay. I drove back to Rogers Hall. I knocked
               on room #839, and male answered the door and he identified
               himself as Jonathan W. White (DOB 09-20-96). I asked if I could
               speak with him in his room or over in the study lounge. White
               said he would like to speak with me in the study lounge because
               Krois was in his room. As we were walking to the study lounge I
               told White I was recording. We got into the study lounge and I
               told White he was free to leave at any time. I asked White if
               he knew why I was there, and he said "yeah, probably because
               the wall". I asked him if he could tell me what happened. White
               told me he was walking home and he had gotten bad news from his
               mom. White said he was angry and that is why he kicked the
               wall. White said he did not mean to kick a hole in the wall
               though. I asked White around what time he did it, and he said
               he thinks around 0300 hours. I asked White if he had been
               drinking, and he said yes. I asked White if he ripped down the
               door tags as well, and he said yeah. I asked White if he
               damaged the bulletin board too, and he said yeah. I asked if
               any of his friend's helped him cause the damage, and he said no
               it was all him. I told White he was responsible for paying for
               the damage, and he said he understood. I told White he would
               just be sent to WSU Student Conduct, as long as he paid for the
               damages he caused. I told him if he does not pay I will forward
               charges on him for malicious mischief, an he said he
               understood. I asked White to clean up the rest of the garbage
               in the hallway, and he said he would. White thanked me and
               shook my hand. He was polite and cooperative throughout my
               encounter with him. I cleared the scene. No further action. My
               Vievu camera was activated, and the video was later downloaded
               into the permanent digital evidence folder. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0267 SYNOPSIS: Report of a parking
               problem near Stephenson Complex. I responded and an infraction
               was issued. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 01/17/16 at about 2145 hrs Dispatch advised of a
               reported parking problem at Stephenson North. I responded and
               contacted the complainant, Pedro J. Murillo (080495), who
               directed me to the problem. There was a red GMC Sierra (WA
               C87276C) parked very close to the passenger side of his
               vehicle. He was concerned his vehicle may be damaged when the
               other subject tried to get in his truck or back out of the
               space. I had no way of identifying the owner of the GMC because
               there was only a temporary parking permit in the window. I
               advised Murillo if he was concerned about damage to his vehicle
               he could move his car to another space and he did so. The GMC
               was parked approximately 1.5 feet into the adjacent parking
               stall, making it impossible for someone to park there with a
               reasonable distance between the two vehicles. I issued the GMC
               a parking infraction for improper parking (148389). Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 18 day of January, 2016, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0269 SYNOPSIS: Report of a possible
               physical domestic at Rogers Hall. Officers responded and both
               parties had just been in an argument. No assault occurred.
               Parties separated and both were given DV pamphlets. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 01-18-16 at
               approximately 0040 hours I was dispatched to the report of a
               possible domestic dispute at Rogers Hall #233, located at 1355
               SE Olympia Ave. Dispatched advised roommates had been arguing.
               It had been physical, but a Resident Advisor (RA) was talking
               with them now. Dispatch advised the complainant, Zachary A.
               Baldwin (DOB 08-06-96), was worried their issues would not be
               resolved quickly. Ofc. Boyd and I arrived on scene. We went to
               room #233, and there was a male standing outside who told us
               there were three students inside the room along with an RA. A
               female came out of room #233 and she was crying and said she
               just wanted to get her stuff out of the room. She told us she
               wanted us to get everything out of the room that she bought,
               and she would go back to her room. Ofc. Boyd told the female to
               come speak with me. The female was later identified as Kiaira
               L. Thomas (DOB 04-07-97). Thomas walked with me down the
               hallway into the nearby study lounge. I told Thomas I was audio
               and video recording. I asked Thomas if she could tell me what
               happened. She told me they just had an argument and that she
               was trying to get her stuff out of there so she could go back
               to her room. I asked her what the argument was over, and she
               said it was just a relationship argument. I asked her if the
               male was her boyfriend, and she replied "yeah for 2 1/2 years".
               I asked her what the argument was over earlier, and she said he
               was mad at her because she wouldn't do his FAFSA (Federal
               Student Aid) for him. Thomas said her and her boyfriend were
               walking to Flix Cafe when she addressed him about the argument
               they had earlier. Thomas said he replied with a stupid comment,
               and she said "If that's how you feel, then don't be with me".
               Thomas said they returned to her boyfriend's room #233 and he
               continued to say negative things towards her. Thomas said her
               boyfriend eventually told her to get out of his room. She told
               me her boyfriend slammed the door in her face, but that she had
               a key to his dorm on her key chain. She said she went back
               inside of the room, and he ripped the key chain out of her hand
               and tried to get his key. Thomas told me she was trying to
               gather her things and phones got broken. I asked who cell
               phones were broken, and she replied "both". I asked her if I
               could see her cell phone and she handed me her broken iPhone 6S

               plus. The entire screen was shattered. I asked her how it was
               broken, and she said it just fell on the floor. I asked her
               where it was before it fell, and she said either on the bed or
               in her pocket. I asked her who knocked down her phone, and she
               said "him, but I don't think it was on purpose". I asked Thomas
               what her boyfriend was doing to cause her cell phone to fall on
               the ground. She said they were not hitting each other at all.
               Thomas said she was trying to get around the room to grab her
               stuff. She said her boyfriend was keeping her from gathering
               her things, but that he was not being aggressive. I asked her
               how her boyfriend was preventing her from gathering her stuff,
               and she said "he would just keep stepping in my way". I asked
               her what she was trying to grab, and she said pretty much
               everything in the room that she bought for him. Thomas said she
               bought him most of the things he owns. I asked Thomas if her
               boyfriend put his hands on her at all, and she said no. I asked
               her if he hit her, and she said no. I asked Thomas about her
               boyfriend's cell phone, and how it got broken. She said when
               she found out her phone was broken, she threw his. Thomas told
               me she threw his phone on the ground. I asked Thomas to roll up
               her sleeves so I could look at her arms, and she did. I did not
               see any marks. I asked Thomas if she ever touched her
               boyfriend, and she said trying to get around him but that she
               never hit him or anything. I asked Thomas to wait there for a
               couple minutes while I went to speak with Ofc. Boyd in the
               hallway. Ofc. Boyd said there was an argument about FAFSA stuff
               and her helping him fill it out. Ofc. Boyd said Thomas threw
               her boyfriend's Xbox controller along with his cell phone, but
               that he did not care about it. Ofc. Boyd said the boyfriend
               gathered up the few belongings of Thomas and said she could
               have it, but anything else in the room she could not unless she
               had a receipt for it (see Ofc. Boyd's supplemental report for
               more details). I went back and told Thomas she could get her
               belongings out of the hallway. I went down to my patrol vehicle
               and grabbed a couple domestic violence pamphlets. I provided
               Thomas with one of the domestic violence pamphlets and I
               explained it to her. She gathered her things and she walked
               back to her room. Ofc. Boyd and I cleared the scene. No further
               action. My Vievu camera was activated, and the video was later
               downloaded into the permanent digital evidence folder. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 19th day of January, 2016, in Pullman,

               6Z0198164 2. NARRATIVE: On 01/18/16 at about 0232 Dispatch
               advised of a report of a disabled vehicle on Forest Way at
               Columbia Village. The vehicle hit a curb and caused the front
               passenger tire to deflate and come off the rim. The reporting
               party believed the driver might be intoxicated. As I was en-
               route the reporting party advised the subject was trying to
               drive away from the scene. Upon my arrival I saw a red Honda
               Accord (WAAQU7197) stopped in the roadway on Forest Way just
               south of Olympia Ave. I noticed there was damage to the front
               bumper of the vehicle and the front passenger tire was rolled
               off the rim. The driver, later identified as Lana M. Schuerman
               (070392), was sitting in the driver's seat with the vehicle
               still running. I pulled in behind the vehicle, activating only
               my rear flashing lights to warn any traffic that might come up
               behind us. I contacted the complainant, Mitchell A. Claymore
               (122294), who told me he was walking home when he heard the
               Honda hit a curb hard. He said Schuerman then tried to drive
               off after hitting the curb, with one tire off the rim from
               hitting the curb. I walked up to the driver's window of the
               vehicle and Schuerman rolled down the window. I asked what was
               going on and she said "Um my car is not doing very well". As
               Schuerman spoke I could smell a very strong odor of intoxicants
               coming from the vehicle and that she spoke with slurred speech.
               I asked why that was and she said, "mostly it's not going up
               this hill". I asked her to turn the car off, make sure it was
               off, and step out of the car. As she was getting out of the car
               she stumbled and had to catch her balance on the door as well
               as raise her arms for balance. I had Schuerman move to a nearby
               parking lot. I asked if she hit something with her car and she
               said no. I asked how much she had to drink and she said "uh
               I've been drinking" but could not tell me how much. I asked if
               she was willing to perform some voluntary field sobriety tests
               and she agreed. I advised her I would be evaluating her based
               on how well she followed my instructions as well as how she
               performed on all the tests. Schuerman said she understood. The
               first test I administered was the horizontal gaze nystagmus
               test. I initially had her remove her glasses but she appeared
               to be having trouble seeing my pen so I had her put them back

               on. I held my pen approximately 12-15 inches from Schuerman's
               face, slightly above eye level. I confirmed she had equal pupil
               size. As I was trying to administer the test Schuerman started
               to move her head side to side. I told her not to move her head
               and to follow the pen wit her eyes only. From that point
               forward she would only stare directly at me without moving her
               eyes at all so I stopped the test. The second test I
               administered was the nine step walk and turn. I had Schuerman
               move up the parking lot further to a flat location. I asked if
               she wanted to put some shoes on because she was barefoot. She
               said she was ok. I told her to imagine a straight line on the
               ground and to put her left foot on that line and then put her
               right foot in front of her left touching heel to toe with her
               arms at her sides. She initially put her left foot in front of
               her right and I had to tell her twice to put her right foot in
               front. I told her to remain in this position while I explained
               the rest of the test and not to start the test until instructed
               to do so. Schuerman said she understood. I told Schuerman to
               take nine steps down the imaginary straight line touching heel
               to toe. I told her to look at her feet the entire time, keep
               her arms at her sides, and count each step out loud. I told her
               once she reached her ninth step to leave her front foot where
               it was and take a small series of steps to turn around. I told
               her to take nine more steps back down the same imaginary
               straight line. I told Schuerman it was a continuous test and
               once she started not to stop until she completed the test. I
               reminded her to touch each step heel to toe, count each step
               out loud, and look at her feet the entire time. I demonstrated
               the test and Schuerman said she understood my instructions.
               Schuerman was unable to maintain her balance and stepped out of
               the starting position once as I was explaining the test. During
               her first nine steps Schuerman failed to touch heel to toe
               between any of her steps. She took her first step then lost her
               balance and started to stumble backward, taking a step behind
               herself to maintain her balance. She then took her second step,
               and started counting at 9. She stopped and then continued
               counting down 8,7,6 and so on with each step. Schuerman stopped
               after her 10th step (her count of 1) and said "what?" I told
               her I had not said anything and to turn as I instructed. She
               turned improperly, moving both feet and turning to the right.
               She then stopped and stood looking at me. I asked if she was
               done and she said, "sure". The next test I administered was the
               one leg stand. I told her to stand with her feet together and
               her arms at her sides. I told her to remain in this position
               while I explained the test and not to start the test until
               instructed to do so. Schuerman said she understood. I told her
               to choose one foot, whichever she was most comfortable with,
               and lift it so her toe was approximately 6 inches off the
               ground. I told her to point her foot so the bottom of her foot
               was parallel with the ground and to keep both legs straight and
               her arms at her sides. I told Schuerman to look at her toe and
               count out loud by 1000's (1001, 1002, 1003, and so on) until
               instructed to stop. I demonstrated the test and asked if she
               had any questions. She said " I guess not". I told her to begin
               and she stood looking at me with a confused look on her face. I

               asked if she had a question and she asked what I wanted her to
               do. I explained the test a second time and asked if she had any
               more questions and she began crying. I waited for her to
               collect herself and asked if she was ready and she said yes.
               Schuerman stood still for the first 7 seconds of the test
               before raising her right foot. She immediately put her foot
               down again. She attempted to raise her foot and put it down
               three more times before standing and looking at me. Schuerman
               did not count out loud at all during the test. I stopped the
               test at 23 seconds because it was clear Schuerman was done and
               was not going to continue with the test. At this time it was my
               opinion that Schuerman's ability to drive a motor vehicle was
               impaired by alcohol. I asked if she would provide a breath
               sample on a PBT. I told her it was voluntary and did not
               replace the evidentiary breath test. I asked when her last
               drink was and she said she didn't know. She could not even give
               an estimate for when her last drink was. I asked again if she
               was willing to provide a breath sample and told her it was
               voluntary and did not replace the evidentiary breath test. She
               said "whatever". Schuerman provided a breath sample of .203 on
               alco sensor FST #5493. I asked how old she was and she said,
               "30 something". I advised Schuerman she was under arrest for
               DUI and placed her in handcuffs (double locked). I told her she
               was being audio and video recorded. As we were walking past her
               car I noticed it was covered in mud as if she had been driving
               off road somewhere. I asked Officer Tiengo to look around to
               see if she left the roadway somewhere. I placed Schuerman in
               the back of my patrol car where I read her her Constitutional
               Rights from a pre printed card. She said she understood her
               rights and verbally waived them. I asked Schuerman where she
               was coming from and she asked why it mattered. I told her I
               wanted to make sure she didn't hit anything, like another
               vehicle. She said "nope". I asked if it was ok for me to enter
               her vehicle to get her ID and she said it was. I asked if she
               wanted anything else from the vehicle and she said no. I
               retrieved her driver's license and vehicle registration from
               the vehicle. I transported Schuerman to the Pullman Police
               Department holding facility. Upon arrival I checked the Draeger
               and found it working properly with the mouth tube warm to the
               touch. I read Schuerman her Constitutional Rights from the DUI
               packet at 0302 hrs. At that time I noticed the Draeger
               machine's time indicated a time of 0102 hrs. I recorded all of
               the times on the DUI packet as the time listed on the Draeger
               instrument however they were all exactly 2 hours behind the
               actual time of the events. I am unsure why the time listed on
               the Draeger instrument were 2 hours behind the actual time.
               Schuerman signed stating her rights were read to her and that
               she was waiving her rights to speak with me. I checked
               Schuerman's mouth for the first time at 0303 hours and found no
               foreign substances. I read her her implied consent warnings for
               breath at 0308 hrs and she signed stating so. I asked if she
               would submit to a breath test and she said "sure whatever". I
               checked the yes box on the DUI packet and asked her to initial
               next to it. Schuerman checked the yes box on the form
               indicating she was confused by the implied consent warnings. I

               asked if she was confused by the warnings and she said,
               "Probably not". I told her I was going to check the no box then
               because she was not confused and asked if that was correct. She
               said "sure". I asked again to confirm she understood and she
               said, "I'm drunk and you want to do whatever you have to do so
               do it." I tried again to confirm and she again said "I'm drunk
               and you want me to take a test, and in regards to reading
               something and understanding what you're asking me to do..." I
               asked if she would like to speak with an attorney and she said
               yes. I contacted the on call public defender at 0311 hrs for
               Schuerman and allowed her to speak with him for as long as she
               needed to. Once I noticed she was done on the phone I had her
               come back to the Drager instrument and checked her mouth again
               at 0322 hrs. I asked if she wanted me to read her implied
               consent warning again and she said no. I asked if she would
               submit to a breath test and she said yes. I asked if she was
               confused by the warnings and she said no. I asked questions
               Schuerman from the DUI packet. She told me she did not have
               impaired vision even though she was wearing glasses with
               corrective lenses. She said she was driving home from walmart
               at the time of the collision but did not know what time she
               left or where she was driving at the time of the collision.
               Schuerman admitted to consuming alcoholic beverages and said
               she had been drinking wine at home. When asked if she believed
               her ability to drive was affected by her alcohol usage she
               said, "sure". I asked if she had ever been arrested for DUI
               before and she said "I don't think so". At about this time
               Schuerman put her fingers in her mouth and I had to restart the
               observation time. I checked her mouth for a third time at 0328
               hours. After the observation period was over I entered the
               information into the draeger instrument. The first breath
               sample Schuerman tried to provide I had her start blowing again
               because I mistakenly thought she had not provided a long enough
               sample. It caused the machine to enter it as an incomplete
               test. I started the test again and Schuerman provided a sample
               and then tried to start blowing again on her own. The machine
               skipped that sample but did not start the test over. She then
               provided a sample of .213 IR/.212EC at 0355 hrs (0155hrs on the
               Draeger) and a second sample of .205 IR/.200EC at 0358hrs (0158
               hrs on the Draeger). The breath test was administered in
               accordance to the methods approved by the Washington State
               Toxicologist pursuant to the Washington Administrative Code. I
               provided Schuerman with a copy of the following documents:
               Driver's hearing request, Notice of hearing/conditions of
               release, and breath test document. I issued Schuerman a
               criminal citation for DUI and she received her copy. I provided
               her with her copy of the vehicle tow/impound form and explained
               to her when and where she could pick up her vehicle. Schuerman
               was released. I offered several times to give her a ride home
               because she did not have any shoes on but she refused. I later
               completed a PTCR for the traffic collision portion of the
               incident. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 18 day of January,
               2016, in Pullman, Washington.
