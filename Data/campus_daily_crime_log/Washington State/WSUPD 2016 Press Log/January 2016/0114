               a suspicious person in Holland Library. Person wasn't currently
               in the library, but they wanted us to be aware. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 011416 at
               approximately 1011 hours, I was dispatched to a report of a
               suspicious person in Holland Library. Upon arrival, I contacted
               Susan Shipman who told me the following. The past couple of
               evenings there has been a white male approximately 5'10" with
               sandy blonde hair seen in the library acting "weird." She
               stated on 011216, the male went to the circulation desk and
               spoke with one of their new employees working the desk. Shipman
               told me she felt extremely uncomfortable because he was asking
               her about when she got off work. The employee worked from 1700
               (011216) to 0200 (011316). I asked if he was making any
               threatening statements, and she told me he wasn't. Shipman told
               me she spoke with him on one occasion and he told her he was 18
               years old and he was living in Pullman. Shipman stated she felt
               he was acting oddly, but didn't do anything wrong. I asked her
               if the subject was currently at the library and she told me he
               wasn't. I told Shipman to have her employees call the police if
               he is continually acting suspicious. I also advised her they
               can call the Intern working security to keep an eye on him and
               they can make a determination to report it if they see fit. I
               told her that if her employees feel uncomfortable and would
               like an escort leaving the library, they can ask the intern
               working security for an escort to their vehicle or residence
               hall if they live on campus. Shipman thanked me for my time and
               told me she would let her staff know. I advised my intern
               command staff to let the interns working security to keep an
               eye out for the subject. Nothing further. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               approximately 1607 hours I was dispatched to a transport call
               at WSU Health and Wellness. Dispatch stated that there was a
               patient who was requesting a transport to PRH for medical
               assessment due to suicidal thoughts. Upon arrival I spoke with
               Sharon R. Schnebly 02/27/77 who stated they had a female, later
               identified as Isabel Angelica Gaspar 11/18/97, who reported
               having suicidal thoughts. Gaspar told the counselors that she
               wanted to go to the hospital for help. I spoke with Gaspar and
               told her I had been told she would like to go to the hospital.
               Gaspar said yes. I asked Gaspar what was going on. Gaspar said
               she just moved to Pullman for the new semester and was in a
               relationship prior to coming. When she got to WSU her
               relationship ended which brought on depression. Gaspar stated
               she used to cut herself a long time ago and she has been
               thinking about cutting again but had not done so. Gaspar said
               she also has had suicidal thoughts over the past few days but
               does not have a plan on how she would do it. I again asked
               Gaspar if she wanted to go to the hospital and she said she
               would. I transported Gaspar to PRH and checked her in with the
               medical staff. Once checked in I cleared. END OF REPORT I

               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 01/15/16 at approximately 2251
               hours, Cougar Security radioed that they had been approached by
               someone who said water was thrown at them from a second floor
               window of Global Scholars Hall. Upon arrival I met with Cougar
               Security and Nolan A. Skerbeck 11/27/96 outside of Global.
               Skerbeck stated he was walking along the eastside of Global
               when someone threw a water bottle at him. Skerbeck did not know
               where the bottle came from other than above him. Skerbeck began
               to walk again and then felt liquid hit the back of his leg.
               Skerbeck determined the liquid to be water. Skerbeck believed
               that the water came from the second floor but he did not know
               which room. Skerbeck said nothing was damaged from the water
               and he was not injured. I went to the 2nd floor and spoke with
               several people about the water. Nobody said they knew anything
               and I did not have enough evidence to accuse anybody I met. Not
               having enough information to determine a suspect, I cleared.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0210 SYNOPSIS: Report of an intoxicated
               individual who had made threats and was being verbally abusive.
               Subject voluntarily left the area and returned to his
               residence. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Poon, Daniel
               K (08/27/97) Warned Trespassing/MIP 2. NARRATIVE: On 01/14/16
               around 2357 hrs I was dispatched to a report of an intoxicated
               male who had been making threats and verbally abusive in room
               380 of Regents Hall. Sgt Daniels also responded and upon our
               arrival we contacted the complainant, later identified as
               Taylor M Penny (01/24/94) and Daniel K Poon (08/27/97) near
               room 380 and were told the following. Poon explained he had
               been visiting a friend and had been contacted by Penny
               regarding the noise in the room. Poon went on to explain Penny
               had also spoke with him regarding the use of alcohol and he
               denied being drunk. Around this point Daniels asked Poon for
               his identification, which he provided, before she spoke with a
               member of hall staff. At this point I asked Poon to step out of
               the room and speak with me and was told the following. Poon
               again explained he had been contacted for the noise in his
               friends room and admitted to having what he described as a loud
               voice. While we continued to speak I noticed the strong odor of
               intoxicants coming from his breath and person. Poon also had
               difficulty with his balance and was swaying approximately 3-4
               inches from center while slurring his words as we spoke. Based
               upon my training and experience these are indicators of someone
               having consumed alcohol. Daniels returned from speaking with
               hall staff around this point and I told Poon to have a seat
               against the wall while I spoke with her. She told me Poon and
               some friends had initially been contacted for noise in room 380
               and were given a warning at that time regarding the noise. A
               short time later they had to return and everyone else in the
               room was compliant at that time with the exception of Poon who
               became argumentative and at one point asking if he needed to
               jump out of the window to leave. It was decided to escort Poon
               from the building and trespass him for the remainder of the
               evening. Daniels and I returned to where Poon was sitting and I
               asked him to stand up, handing him his drivers license and
               Cougar Card which he handed us earlier. Both Daniels and I
               explained we were going to escort him from the building and he
               needed to return to his room in Streit Hall for the remainder
               of the evening. We both explained if he was caught outside
               again he could be subject to arrest for minor exhibiting the
               effects of alcohol in a public place, and if he were caught in

               Regents again he could also be placed under arrest for
               trespassing. Poon told us he understood and we escorted him
               from building at which point he wanted to ask us what his
               rights were and several other questions. After answering the
               remainder of his questions we watching him walk back to Streit
               Hall without incident. Nothing further. I certify and declare

               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Matthew J.M.
               Alvarez/09-01-94 Patient 2. NARRATIVE: On 01-15-16 at
               approximately 0240 hours, Ofc. Whitman and I were dispatched to
               the report of an unconscious male near Thompson and Morrill
               Halls. We responded and eventually found the male on the west
               side of Thompson Hall. The subject was laying on the ground
               with a blanket. He had on a backpack under his coat. I could
               see the male had urinated all over himself. I attempted to wake
               him and he was unresponsive. While waiting for the ambulance,
               we attempted to wake him several times. At one point he tried
               to sit up, but did not open his eyes and did not speak. He then
               passed back out. We attempted to remove the backpack from him,
               but could not get the straps to release. I could smell an
               extremely strong odor of intoxicants emitting from his person.
               Once the medics arrived, they had me cut the straps on his
               backpack to remove it. They were able to get him to wake up,
               but he was not able to answer questions for several minutes.
               His speech was very slurred and when asked his name he would
               answer it. He attempted to get up and walk away and was semi-
               combative, but we were able to get him to sit back down.
               Eventually he told us his name was Matt Alvarez. He was advised
               they were going to take him to the hospital and we helped him
               stand so he could be placed on the gurney. I patted him down at
               this point and found a wallet in his right rear pocket which I
               told him I was going to remove. I found his WA Driver's License
               and he was identified as Matthew J. M. Alvarez/09-01-94. As the
               medics were placing him on the gurney, I did a quick sweep of
               his backpack to make sure there were no weapons. Matthew was
               transported to PRH by PFD Medics, and we cleared. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
