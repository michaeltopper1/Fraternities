               was dispatched to the report of the odor of marijuana emitting
               from Goldsworthy Hall room 308. The RP, Dustin Cooper, advised
               he was on the 3rd floor for contact. Upon my arrival I met
               Cooper in the 3rd floor hallway. He said that the odor was very
               faint, but he believed the odor of marijuana was emitting from
               room 308. I walked towards room 308 and could not smell the
               odor of marijuana in the hallway. I put my nose to the crack of
               several doors. I could not detect the odor of marijuana
               emitting from any rooms on the 3rd floor. I knocked on the door
               to room 308, there was no answer. Cooper said the resident
               might be in the shower. Because I did not detect the odor of
               marijuana in the hall I did not wait to speak to the resident.
               No contacts made. Nothing further. I certify and declare under

               04 DAMAGE: $400 dollars to driver's side rear bumper NARRATIVE:
               On 01/21/16 at approximately 1710 hours I was dispatched to a
               non-injury blocking collision at the intersection of Grimes Way
               and Terre View. Upon arrival I found two vehicles facing
               eastbound on Grimes Way both which were in the right turn lane.
               The first vehicle, a 2015 Toyota Corolla was to the left of the
               second vehicle, a 2012 Hyundai Accent. The Toyota and Hyundai
               were still touching from the collision. The driver's side rear
               bumper of the Hyundai was touching the passenger side rear door
               of the Toyota. Both drivers were out of their cars and on the
               sidewalk. The driver of the Toyota was identified as Casey A.M.
               Dail 03/13/90 and the driver of the Hyundai was identified as
               Lihong Zhu 04/26/64. Both drivers provided me with their
               driver's licenses. vehicle registrations, and proof of
               insurance. Zhu stated she was in the right turn lane on Grimes
               Way about to turn right when she was hit from behind. Zhu said
               she and Dail both exited their cars and Dail was apologetic for
               hitting her. Dail stated Zhu was in front of her in the line of
               cars when she saw Zhu begin to take her right hand turn. Dail
               started to drive forward while looking to her left at traffic.
               Dail said she was focused on a car traveling on Terre View when
               she struck Zhu's car. Dail stated she believed that Zhu had
               already made her turn. Dail was not not looking in front of her
               as she was moving forwards. Both drivers stated they were
               wearing their seatbelt at the time of the collision and were
               not injured. I filled out a exchange of information sheet using
               Sector and provided both drivers with a copy. Once I was able
               to get the cars separated I could see the damage better. The
               damage to Zhu's Hyundai was contained to the driver's side rear
               bumper corner. The fiberglass rear bumper had been pushed in
               and there was a large circular paint transfer mark left. The
               damage to the Hyundai is estimated at $400 dollars. The damage
               to Dail's Toyota was on the passenger's side of the car. The
               sideswipe damage started at the passenger side front wheel well
               and continued to the middle of the rear passenger's side door.

               the damage to both cars were taken and added to the files
               folder. I explained the insurance process to both parties and
               answered any questions they had. No citations were issued in
               this collision due to Zhu entering and stopping in an
               obstructed intersection and Dail negligent driving by not
               watching where she was going while driving forward. END OF

    Narrative: RVWD: Boyd/335 OFC: Whitman / 323 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY
               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0342 SYNOPSIS: Report of a
               vehicle driving on the sidewalk to get around a barricade at
               Ferdinand's Rd and North Fairway Ln. The driver was contacted
               later by phone and warned. Nothing further. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 01/21/16 at about 2216
               hours I was dispatched to a traffic offense at Ferdinand's Rd
               and North Fairway Ln. I responded to the area and talked to the
               reporting party, Jerold Orcutt with parking services. He said
               he motioned for the vehicle to turn around and drive out the
               other way. The driver did not turn around and went up onto the
               curb on the southwest corner of the intersection. The driver
               continued over the sidewalk and turned south onto North Fairway
               Ln. Orcutt said the Men's Basketball game had just let out and
               there were several pedestrians in the area. Officer Westerman
               also responded to the area. We were unable to find the vehicle.
               There was no one struck and no damage caused when the vehicle
               went over the curb. Orcutt was able to provide the vehicles
               license plate number. Dispatch ran the vehicle and found the
               registered owner in local records. I called and left a message
               on the phone of James K. Heidenreich. Heidenreich returned my
               call later. I asked him what happened. He said he was
               attempting to leave and saw a barricade at the intersection of
               Ferdinand's Ln and Stadium Way so he went towards North Fairway
               Ln. He said as he approached the intersection he saw it was
               barricaded. Heidenreich said he saw the parking service person
               make a hand jester back towards Stadium Way and then turn and
               walk away. Heidenreich said he thought the other way was
               blocked as well so he just drove over the curb around the
               barricade and went south on North Fairway Ln. He admitted it
               was probably not the best way to handle the situation. I
               explained it was not, and it was dangerous especially with all
               of the foot traffic at the time. I advised Heidenreich to ask
               the parking service attendants how they want him to exit next
               time rather then driving around barricades. He said he
               understood. Driver warned, nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               2. NARRATIVE: On 01/21/16 at about 2343 hours I was dispatched
               to suspicious call at Goldsworthy Hall. I went to Goldsworthy
               Hall room 204. I talked to the roommates, Crystal Duenas
               Sanchez, and Brenda Onofre, reported they left there room
               unlocked and went to get dinner. When they returned they saw a
               plastic cart in front of the door to there room. They went into
               their room and someone had opened the drawers of their dresser
               and left them open. Duenas Sanchez's boyfriend, Javier Herrera
               Garcia, was also with the roommates during this time. I asked
               if anything was taken. There was nothing taken from the room. I
               asked if there was anything damaged, they said there was not.
               There was a laptop, speakers, and a TV in the room that were
               still there. I asked if there was any cash in the room. Duenas
               Sanchez had cash in her dresser draw that was still there.
               Herrera Garcia had left his wallet in the room with cash in it
               and his wallet and cash were still there. They were unaware of
               anyone who would have come into there room. I asked if there
               was a history of pranks on the floor that may explain someone
               coming into their room. They said there was not. I gave them my
               card with the case number on it and told them if they found
               anything missing or damaged to contact me. I have no suspects
               or leads on who may have trespassed in their room. Recommend
               case be closed until additional information is found. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.
