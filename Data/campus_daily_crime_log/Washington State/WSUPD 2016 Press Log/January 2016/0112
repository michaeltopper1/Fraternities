               16 at about 1329 hours I was dispatched to the report of a hit

               A. Toy, advised his vehicle was parked on Olympia Ave, in front
               of Orton Hall, and would be on scene for contact. I contacted
               Toy at his vehicle, a black 2007 Subaru Impreza, WA/AWZ5575. I
               could see a significant amount of damage to the driver's side

               Sunday night, around 11pm. He said the last time he saw his
               vehicle undamaged was Monday afternoon, around 4pm. Toy said
               there was no note left on his vehicle. He showed me where you
               could see blue paint transfer among the damage. I looked over
               the vehicle and saw that there was significant damage to the
               driver's side door, driver's side rear passenger door, driver's
               side rear quarter panel, rear driver's side tire and possible a
               broken rear axle. The car also appeared to have been moved and
               run into the curb by the force of the collision. You could also
               see tire marks on Olympia Avenue from the suspect vehicle. The
               tire marks begin several feet down the road and you can follow
               the tracks to Toy's car, then swerving away. I took several
               pictures of the scene and Toy's car. On the ground near the
               driver's side of Toy's car I found several pieces of blue paint
               chips. Around this same time, Corporal Stewart was
               investigating another hit and run collision that had been
               reported (16-W0159). The vehicle in Stewart's case was blue and
               in the same proximity of Toy's car. I believed the two
               collisions may be related. I asked Stewart to come look at this
               scene. When he arrived I explained to him what I had learned.
               Together we collected the blue paint chips from the ground and
               placed them in an evidence bag. Stewart maintained control of
               the evidence. He then went to the other car to continue
               investigating the possible relationship of the two reports. I
               obtained Toy's insurance information and gave him my business
               card with this case number. Upon further investigation it was
               determined that the hit and run Stewart was investigating was
               actually the suspect vehicle in this case. Both of these cases
               will be combined and completed under case 16-W0159. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 13th day of January, 2016, in Pullman,

               backpack being stolen. Backpack was found in the subjects car.
               No theft occurred. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 01/12/16 at approximately 2008 hours I was
               dispatched to a theft call at the Stephenson Gym. Upon arrival
               I met with Juan Luo 05/26/86 at the main lobby. Luo stated that
               at approximately 1915 hours she left her backpack in the female
               bathroom of the Stephenson Gym while she attended an aerobics
               class. When Luo went back for her bag she found it was gone.
               Luo stated her backpack had the following items in it, Macbook
               Pro laptop, Iphone 5s, wallet, debit/credit cards, WADL, WSU
               Cougar Card, and her car and house keys. I asked Luo if she had
               tried the find my Iphone app yet and she had not. I let Luo use
               my cell phone to access her account. The find my Iphone app
               stated her cell phone was somewhere in the Stephenson Complex
               area. The app has a function that will cause the lost phone to
               make a noise to find it. I had the phone make a noise and we
               both could hear it near us. Luo had a shoulder bag with her and
               we found her phone in the bag. I took the Iphone off the items
               stolen list. Again using find my Iphone app we were able to
               lock her Macbook pro and put a message on it to report the
               laptop to the police. I asked Luo if she would show me where
               she had placed the bag. We went downstairs to the Stephenson
               Gym and Luo escorted my into the Women's bathroom were she put
               her bag. Luo pointed out that she had purposefully left her bag
               in the corner of the handicapped bathroom stall. I asked Luo
               why she left it in the bathroom and did not use a locker that
               was free for her to use. Luo said she did not think of it. I
               searched the Gym area but did not find her backpack. I provided
               Luo with my business card, case number, and instructions on how
               to provide me with the serial number and MAC address for her
               laptop. At this point Luo remembered that her car keys were in
               her backpack and became very emotional. I asked Luo if she had
               any spare car keys at her house and Luo said no she only had
               the one. I told Luo that I would give her a ride home and gave
               her a few options about her car. Luo told me that her car was
               illegally parked in the green parking lot next to Krugel Hall.
               I told Luo that I would contact parking about the issue but I
               could not make any promises. I drove Luo to her car so I could
               take down her license plate number. Luo pointed out her car and
               I decided to check her car and make sure her backpack was not
               in it. When looking through the window I could see a black
               backpack in the backseat as Luo had described. I asked Luo if

               that was the backpack she was looking for and Luo knelt down
               overcome with emotion as it was the backpack she thought had
               been stolen. I again asked Luo if her keys were in her backpack
               and she said they were. I decided to check her car door to see
               if it was locked before getting the tools to unlock her car. I
               found Luo's car to be unlocked. I asked Luo to look through her
               backpack and make sure all her items were still there and they
               were. I asked Luo to look for her keys and she could not find
               them. I asked Luo to look in her shoulder bag that was still on
               her shoulder. Luo found her keys in her shoulder bag that had
               been with her the entire time. It was determined that at no
               point was anything stolen. Luo had just forgot that she left
               her bag in the car and not taken it inside with her. I
               cautioned Luo about keeping her car unlocked and told her to
               always use the lockers at the gym. I asked Luo if there was
               anything else I could do for her and she said no. The theft is
               unfounded as nothing was ever stolen. END OF REPORT I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.

               07/15/95 Student Conduct Poss. of Marijuana NARRATIVE: On
               01/12/16 at approximately 2311 hours I was driving towards
               Magpie Forest on Merman Drive when I noticed a white Saturn
               sedan parked at the end of Merman Drive. The Saturn was crooked
               in the roadway with the windows fogged over. I put my spot
               light on the car and walked up. The driver, Alexis Susan Lucero
               12/25/96, rolled down the window and I could see smoke rolling
               out the now open window. The smoke smelled strongly of burnt
               marijuana. I asked for Lucero's ID and she provided it. Lucero
               was identified as 19 years old. I asked for the passenger's ID
               but he said he did not have it. The passenger verbally
               identified himself as Jared Samuel Eidenmuller 07/15/95. I
               asked if either one had a medical marijuana card and both said
               no. I asked them how much marijuana was in the car and Lucero
               said they had smoked everything they brought. I asked what they
               used to smoke with and Lucero said it was a blunt. Without
               prompt Eidenmuller said I could search the car. I told the two
               to remain in the car while I checked on a few things. The
               vehicle was parked in Pullman PD's jurisdiction so I had a
               Pullman Officer respond. Ofc. Gordon arrived on scene and
               stated that I could handle the call. I returned to Lucero and
               asked if I had her permission to search the car and she said
               yes. I advised Lucero of the Ferrier Warnings and again asked
               if I had her consent to search the car. Lucero said I did. As
               Lucero and Eidenmuller exited the car, Lucero said all I would
               find is the rice krispy's treat in her purse. During the search
               a small amount of loose marijuana was found on the floorboard
               on the passenger seat. I also located the rice krispy treat in
               Lucero's purse. I returned to Lucero and asked if the rice
               krispy's treat was a marijuana infused edible. Lucero said it
               was. I asked Lucero how many hits of marijuana she had and she
               stated about 5 hits. I asked Eidenmuller how many hits he had
               and he said about the same. I told Lucero that she could be
               arrested for minor operating a motor vehicle after consuming
               marijuana and possession of marijuana. I told Lucero that due
               to the small amount of marijuana she consumed I would not be
               arresting her. I also told her she would not be charged for the
               marijuana edible. Both Lucero and Eidenmuller were told they
               would be referred to student conduct for their illegal

               been smoking marijuana they could not drive. I told them to
               call a sober driver to get them home. I told the two they were
               free to do and I cleared. Once back at the station I logged the

               walking. I drove slowly past the two and Petcovic turned his
               head and looked straight at me. Petcovic appeared to be under
               the age of 21. I passed the two and turned around near
               Northside Hall. I caught back up with Petcovic near Global
               Scholors Hall. I stopped my car and walked up to Petcovic and
               told him I needed to talk to him. Petcovic stopped and so did
               his friend who was later identified as Tevin Brandon Crisostomo
               09/06/96. I asked Petcovic where he was walking to and he said
               Streit Perham. Petcovic tried to shake my hand and I told him I
               did not want to. Petcovic began to tell me that some people do
               not want to shake his hand. Petcovic was not making sense.
               Petcovic's words were heavily slurred and repetitive as he
               spoke. As Petcovic spoke I could clearly smell the strong odor
               of intoxicants coming from his breath. I asked Petcovic for his
               ID and he provided me with his WADL. Petcovic was identified as
               19 years old. I explained what I had observed and Petcovic
               began to talk over me. It took me several tries to get Petcovic
               to stop talking and listen. I asked Petcovic how much he had to
               drink and Petcovic said, "I've had some stuff to drink
               tonight." I asked how much and Petcovic said, "a good amount."
               I asked Petcovic to put a number on his drinks and he said he
               had "five beers and a couple of mixed drinks." I asked Petcovic
               if I could look at his eyes and he said I could. I told
               Petcovic to stand with his heels and toes together which he
               did. I told Petcovic to put his arms at his sided and he put
               them behind his back. I told Petcovic several times to put his
               hands at his sides before he did so. I asked Petcovic if he
               could see the tip of my pen where my finger was touching it.
               Petcovic said yes but he was not looking at it. It took several
               tries until Petcovic could find the tip of my pen. As Petcovic
               was looking for it he was swaying severely in all directions.

               Petcovic was swaying to such a degree that he had to take a
               small step backwards in order not to fall over. During the test
               Petcovic was not following the pen correctly but rather looking
               in all sorts of directions. I eventually stopped the test after
               a few passes because it was clear that Petcovic was not going
               to be able to do the test due to his high intoxication level.
               During the test I observed equal tracking and lack of smooth
               pursuit. Petcovic's eyes were watery. I asked a series of
               questions to determine his mental status. Petcovic was able to
               answer all questions correctly however he was slow to answer
               them. I asked Petcovic if he was willing to take a voluntary
               PBT and he said he would. I found my PBT (Alco Sensor FST
               #16805) in working condition. Petcovic provided a PBT sample of
               .222. I spoke with Crisostomo who stated he was Petcovic's
               roommate. I asked Crisostomo if he was willing to watch over
               Petcovic for the night. Crisostomo said he would. I told
               Petcovic that I would be forwarding charges of MIP Exhibiting
               to the Prosecutor and this case would also be referred to
               student conduct. Petcovic said he understood. Petcovic also
               told me he was on academic probation because he got under a 1.0
               GPA last semester. I told Petcovic that he was free to go and
               he said he wanted to tell me something. Petcovic said that he
               is trying to get into Lamda Chi Alpha so that's why he was
               drinking. Petcovic went on to tell me several times that he
               knows he's drunk but glad Officers are out making sure people
               are being safe. I told Petcovic that he was free to go but
               Petcovic kept talking. Petcovic had already put his hand on my
               shoulder several times and each time I told him not to touch
               me. Petcovic put his hand on my shoulder again and I grabbed
               his hand and pushed him away from me. I told Petcovic to leave
               several times before Crisostomo grabbed Petcovic and lead him
               home. END OF REPORT I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 13th day of January,
               2016, in Pullman, Washington.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0177 SYNOPSIS: Subject was stopped for
               making a left hand turn onto Stadium Way from Spokane St. He
               was arrested for minor operating a motor vehicle after
               consuming alcohol. Subject was cited and released. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Nathan T. Gordon/07-07-97 Cited
               and Released Minor DUI 10155 2. NARRATIVE: On 01-13-16 at
               approximately 0054 hours I was on patrol in the area of Stadium
               Way near Nevada St. I was traveling southbound on Stadium Way
               through the Nevada St. intersection when I observed a white,
               1995 Nissan Maxima (WA Lic. ANK5052) make a left hand turn onto
               Stadium Way from Spokane St. There is a concrete barrier
               dividing the north and south bound lanes on Stadium Way near
               Spokane St. The vehicle had to travel in the southbound lanes
               before drifting over to the northbound lanes to get around the
               concrete barrier. I turned around and got behind the Nissan,
               and I activated my emergency lights. The vehicle came to a stop
               on NE Stadium Way near Gannon Hall. I stopped the vehicle for
               the above mentioned traffic violation. I contacted the driver
               of the vehicle, who was later identified as Nathan T. Gordon
               (DOB 07-07-97). When I got up to the driver's side window
               Gordon had his right hand raised and extended towards me as if
               he wanted a handshake. I advised him I was audio and video
               recording. I asked Gordon if he knew why I was pulling him
               over, and he said "yeah, I took that left turn when I shouldn't
               have been". I asked to see his driver's license, vehicle
               registration, and proof of insurance. He immediately handed me
               his driver's license. Gordon told me he had multiple vehicle
               registrations and proof of insurance cards so he would have to
               find the current ones. I asked him where he was coming from,
               and he said he left Greek Row and he is headed back to his dorm
               to go to bed. I asked where his dorm was, and he said back
               there at Stephenson, but that he had to go pick up his friend
               who had been drinking too much tonight. Gordon then said, "I
               hate kind of being like the sober friend, make sure all my
               friends get home safe". Gordon's eyes were watery and I could
               smell the strong odor of intoxicants coming from the vehicle.
               His speech was slurred and repetitive. Gordon eventually found
               his current vehicle registration, but was unable to find the
               most current proof of insurance card. I told Gordon to continue
               looking for his current proof of insurance card, and if he
               found it to wait in his vehicle for me. I told him I would be
               back in a few minutes. I returned to my patrol vehicle and
               radioed Dispatch to do a records check on Gordon. Dispatch

               advised Gordon's driver's license was clear and current. I
               walked back up to the vehicle and re-contacted Gordon. I told
               Gordon I knew he said he was the sober driver, but I asked if
               he had anything to drink today, and he said "no sir". Gordon
               then said he had been drinking beers with friends earlier in
               the morning. I asked Gordon if he would be willing to take a
               voluntary preliminary breath test (PBT), and he said no. I
               asked him if he would be willing to take some voluntary field
               sobriety tests, and he said "yeah, sure". I asked him to please
               step out of the vehicle, and he did. Ofc. Whitman soon arrived
               on scene as backup officer. Gordon was wearing a tank top,
               jeans, and vans type tennis shoes. I asked Gordon if he wanted
               to put on a jacket because it's pretty cold outside, and he
               said "no I'm good, I'm still pretty hyped up from the party, we
               got a lot of pretty girls over tonight you know". We walked
               over to the level sidewalk were I administered the field
               sobriety tests. The weather was cold and it was lightly
               raining. Lighting was provided by my flashlight and nearby
               ambient light. I reminded Gordon I was still audio and video
               recording. I asked him if he was under the care of a doctor,
               and he replied he has health insurance. I asked if he was sick
               or injured, and he said "no sir". I asked if he wears contacts
               or glasses normally, and he said "no sir I do not". The first
               test I administered was the HGN. I told Gordon to follow the
               tip of my pen with his eyes only. I told him to keep his head
               still. I held my pen approximately 12-15 inches in front of
               Gordon's face and administered the test. I checked Gordon's
               eyes and noticed they tracked equally and his pupils were equal
               in size. I did not see resting nystagmus in either eye. I saw a
               lack of smooth pursuit in both of his eye's. I saw distinct and
               sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation in both of his eye's.
               I did not see onset of nystagmus prior to 45 degrees in either
               eye. I did not see any vertical nystagmus in either eye. While
               administering the test, I had to remind Gordon to keep his head
               still for me. He complained that he was cold and began
               shivering really bad. I stopped the test so he could grab his
               sweatshirt from the trunk of his vehicle. I then finished
               administering the HGN test. The next test I administered was
               the walk and turn. I told Gordon I wanted him to pretend there
               was an imaginary straight line out in front of him. I told him
               to place his left foot on that imaginary straight line. I told
               Gordon to put his right foot in front of his left foot, with
               the heel of his right foot touching the toes of his left foot.
               I told Gordon to keep his arms by his side. I told him to stay
               in that position while I explained the test. I told Gordon to
               take nine heel to toe steps down the line and to take nine heel
               to toe steps back. I demonstrated three heel to toe steps for
               Gordon. I told him once he gets to his last step to keep his
               lead foot planted on the ground, and take a series of small
               steps with his other foot. I demonstrated the turn and three
               more heel to toe steps for Gordon. I told Gordon to watch his
               feet as he walked, count his steps out loud, keep his arms at
               his sides, and not to stop walking until he completes the test.
               Instruction Phase: Gordon got out of the starting position
               right before I began demonstrating the test for him. His right

               heel was not touching the toes of his left foot. After I
               demonstrated the turn, Gordon began doing the turn himself, and
               asked "like that?". I told him I could demonstrate the turn for
               him again if he wanted, but to get back into the starting
               position. Gordon had his feet reversed in the starting position
               from what I had originally told him. I asked him if he wanted
               me to demonstrate or explain the instructions again, and he
               said no. Gordon got out of the starting position again. I asked
               him if he understood the test, and he said yes. I told him
               again his right foot was supposed to be ahead of his left foot.
               I asked if he had any questions, and he said no. I told Gordon
               to begin the test. First Nine Steps: I had to remind him to
               count out loud and watch his feet as he walked. On steps 3 & 4
               he missed heel to toe. Turn: I did not observe any clues.
               Second Nine Steps: Steps 1 & 2 he stepped off line to the left.
               Steps 5 & 6 he stepped off line to the left. Steps 8 & 9 he
               stepped off line to the right. The next test I administered was
               the one leg stand. I told Gordon to stand with his feet
               together, and his arms by his side until I told him to do
               otherwise, and he said "yes sir". I told Gordon when I tell him
               to begin, to raise either leg of his choice approximately 6
               inches off the ground. I told him to point his toe to keep his
               foot parallel to the ground. I was demonstrating the test to
               Gordon as I was explaining the instructions. I told him once I
               tell him to begin to keep his foot parallel to the ground. I
               told Gordon to count out loud by 1000's until I tell him to
               stop. I told him to look at his raised foot, keep his arms by
               his side, and I reminded him to not stop counting until I tell
               him to stop. While I was demonstrating the test I had to remind
               Gordon to get back into the starting position. I asked him what
               leg he was going to raise, and said earlier he was going to
               raise his left, but then said right. I asked him if he had any
               other questions, and he said no. I told him he may begin.
               Gordon raised his right leg and it was not straight at all. He
               used both his arms at the start to regain his balance. At the
               count of one thousand eleven he hopped. Gordon got to a count
               of one thousand fourteen after 30 seconds had elapsed. I again
               asked Gordon if he would now want to take the voluntary PBT,
               and he said no. I told Gordon he was under arrest for Minor
               Operating a Motor Vehicle After Consuming Alcohol. I handcuffed
               Gordon (double locked) and searched him incident to arrest,
               finding no items of evidentiary value or weapons. I read him
               his Constitutional Rights from my department issued Miranda
               Warning card. I asked Gordon if he understood his rights, an he
               said yes. I asked if he would be willing to speak with me, and
               he said yes. I placed him in the back of my patrol vehicle.
               Gordon gave Ofc. Whitman permission to park his vehicle for
               him. Ofc. Whitman parked his vehicle in the grey 2 lot behind
               Rogers Hall for Gordon. I transported Gordon to Pullman Police
               Department for the breath test. I read Gordon his
               Constitutional Rights at about 0110 hours. Gordon said he
               understood his rights and signed both signature blocks. Gordon
               originally said he did not want to speak with an attorney.
               However, after reading him Implied Consent Warning for Breath
               Gordon had questions so I suggested he speak with an attorney.

               At approximately 0133 hours I directed Gordon to the interview
               room so he could speak with an attorney. I called John Hart on
               the phone and advsied him I arrested Gordon for Minor Operating
               a Motor Vehicle after Consuming Alcohol. I left the interview
               room while Gordon spoke with Hart. I read Gordon his Implied
               Consent Warning for Breath at 0149 hours. Gordon signed that it
               was read to him. I checked Gordon's mouth at 0150 hours,
               finding no foreign substance. I asked Gordon if he would submit
               to a breath test, and he said yes. He checked the yes box and
               initialed next to it. Gordon provided a breath sample of .066
               (IR) / .068 (EC) at 0212 hours and a sample of .067 (IR) / .068
               (EC) at 0215 hours. The breath test was administered in
               accordance to the methods approved by the Washington State
               Toxicologist pursuant to the Washington Administrative Code.
               Gordon was fingerprinted and photographed. I issued Gordon
               criminal citation #10155 for Minor Operating a Motor Vehicle
               after Consuming Alcohol. I provided him with a copy of the
               driver's hearing request, and explained it to him. I provided
               him with his criminal citation. I explained all the forms to
               Gordon, and returned all of his property to him. I later
               provided him with his notice of hearing/conditions of release
               and explained it to him. I provided Gordon a courtesy transport
               back to his dorm at Stephenson North. I later downloaded the
               video footage from my Vievu camera to the permanent digital
               evidence folder. I later faxed the DUI report to the Washington
               Department of Licensing. Gordon was polite and cooperative
               throughout our encounter. No further action at this time. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 13th day of January, 2016, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer
