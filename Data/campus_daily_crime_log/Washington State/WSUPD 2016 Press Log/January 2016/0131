               warned for flying a drone at the intersection of Main St and
               Stadium Way. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 01/31/16 at approximately 0753 hours I was
               approaching the intersection of Main St and Stadium Way when I
               noticed a drone hovering high above the intersection. I located
               the pilot on the hillside at the north west side of the
               intersection and identified him as Derek A. Huovar-Reeves
               (07/28/82). Reeves is a photographer and was taking pictures
               and video of the new construction at the intersection for the
               company that completed the WSU signs. Ofc. McNannay arrived on
               scene and we warned Reeves since he was aware of the
               requirements of operating a drone, but did not realize he was
               within 5 miles of an airport. Agency assist, nothing further. I

               approximately 2100 hours I was dispatched to the report of the
               odor of marijuana emitting from room #533 in Gannon Hall,
               located at 1459 SE Stadium Way. Ofc. Boyd and I arrived on
               scene. We went to room #533 and I could smell the strong odor
               of burnt marijuana emitting from the crack in the door. I
               knocked on the door and a male answered, he was later
               identified as Cody R. Haggerton (DOB 10-17-96). I asked
               Haggerton if he knew why we were there, and he said no. I told
               him his room smells like marijuana, and he replied "nobody has
               been smoking in here". I asked him where he had been smoking
               earlier, and he hesitated to answer. I told him my report was
               going to be sent to WSU Student Conduct, and that him being
               truthful would help his case. I asked Haggerton how much
               marijuana was in the room, and he told me he barely had any. He
               told me his friend had marijuana, but he left earlier. I told
               Haggerton to gather up his marijuana, drug paraphernalia,
               alcohol, or any other illegal drugs in his room. Haggerton told
               me all of his marijuana was inside of his grinder. He also had
               a glass pipe in his room, I asked him if that is what he used
               to smoke the marijuana with, and he said yeah. Haggerton had
               empty bottles of liquor in his room that he gathered up as
               well. I asked Haggerton where him and his friend were smoking,
               and he said outside. He told me they were smoking outside of
               Gannon Hall near the path. I asked him how old he was, and he
               said 19. I asked if he had a medical marijuana card, and he
               said no. Haggerton walked outside to the dumpster with Ofc.
               Boyd and I. He threw away his small amount of marijuana, glass
               pipe containing burnt marijuana residue, metal grinder, and
               empty liquor bottles. I told him he would be referred to WSU
               Student Conduct. We cleared the scene. No further action. My
               Vievu camera was activated, and the video was later downloaded
               into the permanent digital evidence folder. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               uncooperative. I responded and provided assistance in dealing
               with the individual. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 02/01/16 at about 0433 hrs Dispatch advised hall
               staff was requesting assistance dealing with an intoxicated
               student at Orton room 226. The subject was said to be
               intoxicated and very uncooperative. At one point he closed the
               door and refused to open it to speak with hall staff. Upon my
               arrival I contacted the complainant, Jenafer L. Doolittle, who
               told me they contacted the resident, later identified as Bryce
               P. Johns, because he was very intoxicated. He became
               uncooperative and refused to give them his name. When they
               asked for his middle initial he responded with, "Fuck You".
               Doolittle said he never made any threats but was just
               uncooperative. The door to room 226 was open and I could see
               Johns laying on the bed with the lights off. I illuminated him
               with my flashlight and directed him to come out and speak with
               me. He stat silent and it was clear he did not want to
               cooperate. I advised him that if he did not cooperate it was
               only going to end up worse for him. Johns then cooperated and
               came out of the room. He provided me with his name and date of
               birth. I counseled him on his drinking habits and about
               cooperating with hall staff. Nothing further. I certify and
