               on ground. Meters collected and taken to Parking Services.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               01/03/16 at approximately 1050 hours I was driving west on NE
               Cougar Way near Streit Hall. I noticed the top (money
               collection portion) of a parking meter laying on the ground
               next to the pole. I checked on the meter and found no damage to
               the pole or the meter. I did not see tire tracks leading up to
               it either. I picked up the meter and checked for pry marks or
               anything of the sort, but did not find any. I collected the
               meter and placed it in the back of my patrol car. I looked at
               the other parking meters and noticed they were not locked in
               place. I easily picked them up out of the poles. I collected
               the other two meters and transported all three to Parking
               Services. I set them in the vestibule between the lobby and
               main doors. I sent Chris Boyan an email explaining the
               circumstances. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 3rd day of January, 2016, in
               Pullman, Washington. _______________________________________

               damage. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 01/03/16 at approximately 1235 hours I was driving around
               and came upon a vehicle stuck in the snow on the north side of
               SE Forest Way approximately 1/4 mile west of SR 270. There were
               two good Samaritans on scene who had attempted to pull the
               vehicle out, but were unsuccessful. I spoke with the driver of
               the vehicle, Benjamin Durr, and asked what happened. Durr said
               he was making a U-Turn (indicating he was traveling east on
               Forest Way) when his front tires got sucked into the snowy
               ditch. I asked if he had a preference for a tow and he said he
               did not. I asked Whitcom for the next available tow and Myers
               was dispatched. Myers arrived on scene and pulled the vehicle
               out. There was no damage to the vehicle and it drove away from
               the scene. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 3rd day of January, 2016, in Pullman,

               Possession of Marijuana 2. NARRATIVE: On 01-03-2016 at about
               2340 hrs I was dispatched to a report of the odor of burning
               marijuana originating from Stephenson South #931, located at
               1285 SE Stadium Way. I arrived on scene and contacted several
               hall staff members in the hallway, including the complainant,
               Joshua B. McPhatter (DOB 06-24-1989). McPhatter is the hall
               director for Stephenson East. I approached the door to room
               #931, and I could detect the odor of burning marijuana
               originating from inside the room. I knocked on the door, and it
               was answered by Kasandra S. Numair (DOB 06-05-1997). Numair is
               a resident of the room and is 18 years old. Numair was the only
               occupant of the room. The odor of burning marijuana became
               stronger when the door to room was opened, and I could detect
               an obvious and strong odor of burning marijuana originating
               from inside the room. Numair admitted to smoking marijuana
               inside the room with a joint. Numair said she had smoked all
               her marijuana and told me she had nothing left inside the room.
               Numair mentioned she might have a marijuana pipe in the room
               but was not sure of its location. Numair looked through her
               room but could not find the pipe. I advised Numair to remove
               her pipe from campus if she found it later. I counseled Numair
               for possessing marijuana and smoking in her residence hall
               room. Numair was cooperative, and I explained to her that I
               would not be taking any enforcement action. I told Numair that
               the case would be forwarded to WSU Student Conduct for review.
               I cleared the scene. No further action at this time.
               Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
