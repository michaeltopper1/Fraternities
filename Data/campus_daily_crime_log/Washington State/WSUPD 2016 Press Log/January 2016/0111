    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Olmstead/339 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0136 SYNOPSIS: The complainant requested
               a missing person report be generated for a family member.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 01-11-
               2016 at about 1626 hrs I was dispatched to a report of a
               missing person. I contacted the complainant, Xiao Chen (DOB 07-
               25-1987), on the telephone. Chen requested that his cousin be
               reported as a missing person. Chen's cousin was identified as
               Yifeng Qian (DOB 07-10-1992). Chen said he has not been able to
               contact Qian for over a year. Chen reported that Qian had been
               an electrical engineering student at WSU and might have
               graduated in Fall 2014. Chen explained that Qian is from China.
               Qian's parents currently live in China and have also not been
               able to contact him. Chen explained that Qian's family has no
               idea what happened to Qian after he came to WSU. Chen initially
               reported Qian missing to WSUPD last year and Officer Kirshner
               handled the investigation. The case was never resolved. For
               more information, see related case 15-W1614. I checked My WSU
               records and identified Qian's WSU identification number as:
               011196895. Qian's last known local address is 1620 NE Northwood
               Drive #M202 in Pullman, Washington. Qian is not currently
               registered for classes, and the last activity on his account
               appears to be from 2013. Two other addresses were listed for
               Qian: 710 NE Chinook Drive #C14 Pullman, WA 99163 Suzhou Rm 901
               Bldg 15 Jing Yun Jiayua China Qian's email address was listed
               as allen.qian@wsu.edu. Chen provided a possible telephone
               number for Qian, 509-338-5437. I called the telephone number
               and sent a text message. I also sent a message to the email
               address. I did not receive any response. Dispatch conducted a
               nationwide driver license search for Qian (using both possible
               first names of Yifeng and Allen) with negative results. Chen
               provided me with Qian's Chinese passport number: G39012098.
               Chen also stated that Qian has a Bank of America account and
               provided the account number for the account: 138100193637. Chen
               said Qian's parents have continued to transfer money to the
               account but do not have the capability to monitor the account
               for activity. I suggested to Chen that the parents might want
               to stop transferring money into the bank account, because a
               lack of money in his account might compel Qian to contact
               family. Chen provided me with Qian's passport photograph, which
               appeared to be the same as his My WSU photograph. The passport
               photograph has been downloaded and attached to Qian's name file
               in Spillman. I located a Facebook page registered to a Allen
               Qian. According to the information on the page, this person

               might be in Germany. I forwarded the Facebook page information
               to Chen and asked him to contact me if he believed the Facebook
               page belonged to Qian. Chen provided me with his email address:
               xiaochen@ufl.edu. Chen stated that both he and Qian's parents
               are very concerned about Qian and are willing to assist in any
               way that they can. This case will be reassigned to Officer
               Kirshner, the original investigating officer, so the case
               information can be evaluated for assistance from the Washington
               State Patrol Missing Persons Information Center. Investigation
               continues. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this __11__ day of

               dispute. One suspect was taken into custody. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Moliga, Fiaai R (05/19/90) Case
               Forwarded Assault 4th (DV) 2. NARRATIVE: On 01/11/16 around
               2017 hrs Ofc Olmstead and I were dispatched to a report of a
               possible domestic violence in progress in apartment J-30,
               located at 540 SE Forest Way. Upon our arrival we found the
               door to the apartment open and as we approached we were
               contacted by a female, later identified as Fofaagaoalii A Laa
               (08/30/91). Laa confirmed she had called the police and upon
               entering and clearing the other areas of the apartment we
               noticed the sound of running water from the shower area of the
               bathroom. We asked if the male half was in the shower and were
               told he was before she continued and told us the following. Laa
               explained her and her boyfriend, later identified as Fiaai R
               Moliga (05/19/90) had been arguing. During the argument Moliga
               had pushed Laa in both shoulders while backing up towards the
               bathroom area. Moliga had entered the shower area of the
               bathroom, which is separated from the rest of the bathroom by
               another door. As he had begun to shut the door, Laa reached
               inside causing her arm to become caught in the door. Laa began
               to pull her arm from the door as Moliga had tried to shut the
               door again, which caught her hand in the door. Laa pointed out
               both her arm and knuckle area on her right index finger were
               hurt as a result. Both Olmstead and I looked for any indication
               of an injury to the areas she had described and initially found
               none. Around this point Moliga exited the shower with a towel
               and I asked him to have a seat while Olmstead took Laa to an
               adjoining room to continue to speak with her. As I spoke with
               Moliga I asked him what had been going on and was initially
               told nothing. As we continued to speak he told me he and Laa
               had been aruging and confirmed they were both dating. I asked
               him if he had pushed or touched Laa and was told he had not. We
               continued to speak during which time he told me the following.
               Moliga explained both he and Laa had been arguing. During this
               argument he told her he was going to take a shower. As he
               entered the shower portion of the bathroom Laa was following
               him. He told me he shut the door at which point She tried to
               again get in. Moliga told her he was going to contact the
               police, which he did, before she discontinued trying to enter
               the bathroom. Shortly after this Moliga disconnected from his
               call with Whitcom and took his shower before Olmstead and I
               arrived. I confirmed with him that there had been no physical

               contact and was told that was correct. Around this point
               Olmstead and I spoke. He told me Laa had explained the same
               events she had earlier and upon looking at the areas she had
               indicated were injured more closely he could not see any
               indications of abrasions or bruising at that time. We continued
               to speak before it was decided that he would speak with Moliga
               and I would speak with Laa before we proceeded further. As I
               went to speak with Laa she relayed the same version of events
               she had told us earlier. At this point I asked her to explain
               the sequence again to me from when Moliga had entered the
               shower area of the bathroom. She told me she had gone in to use
               the bathroom at which point Moliga, who was already in there
               had shut the door on her. She then returned to the living room
               area where she began to eat a bit before returning to the
               shower area which was when Moliga shut the door on her arm and
               knuckle. After this she contacted Whitcom and Olmstead and I
               arrived a short time later. I asked her to show me the areas
               which had been injured and she pointed to her right forearm. I
               used both my flashlight and the light in the room and could not
               see any indication of bruising or abrasions in that area. She
               then indicated the knuckle on her right hand had also been
               injured. I again looked at the area indicated and saw no
               immediate indication of injury to the area described. Shortly
               after speaking with Laa I returned and spoke with Olmstead. It
               was decided based upon what we had been told to place Moliga in
               custody and we both walked into the room where he was currently
               sitting. I explained to him what had been decided and told him
               he under arrest for assault 4th. I asked him to stand up and
               place his hands behind his back and placed him in handcuffs,
               which were double locked. He was also advised of his right to
               counsel before Olmstead read him his Miranda warnings and
               advising him he was being audio and video recorded. Around this
               point I noticed my recorder had stopped functioning. It was
               later shut off before I concluded this call. Moliga, who was
               compliant during the entire incident, was then brought down to
               my patrol car where he was secured. Olmstead returned to speak
               with Laa a short time later and provided her with a Domestic
               Violence information packet while I transported Moliga to the
               Pullman Police Department holding facility before he was later
               transported to the Whitman County Sheriff's Office Jail for
               processing. I returned to the WSU Police Department a short
               time later and spoke with Olmstead. He told me when he returned
               to speak with Laa and give her the Domestic Violence
               information packet he noticed some slight discoloration in her
               right knuckle of her index finger. This was the finger she had
               indicated had been injured earlier. I thanked Olmstead for the
               information and after completing the necessary paperwork Moliga
               was transported to the Whitman County Sheriff's Office Jail by
               Ofc Tiengo before I completed this case and Olmstead
               downloading his video, which was later added. Nothing further.
               I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws
               of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 11th day of January, 2016, in Pullman,

               walking westbound along the sidewalk by the Lower Soccer Field.
               They caught my attention because one of the females, later
               identified as Chelsea M. Davidson (080196), had a metal flask
               sticking out of her back pocket. As I drove past I could see
               Davidson appeared to be under the age of 21. I turned around
               and contacted Davidson on near the Lower Soccer Field. I asked
               if she could stop to talk to me and she did. I asked what was
               in the flask in her back pocket and she said alcohol. I asked

               Way passing Northside Hall when I noticed two females who were
               walking westbound on Cougar Way near Northside Hall. They
               caught my attention because one of them, later identified as
               Lacey D. Joner (021597), was having difficulty walking. She was
               stumbling from side to side and her friend, who was not
               identified, was holding her by the arm to help her maintain her
               balance. I turned around and as I approached them again I could
               see Joner sitting on a wall in front of Northside Hall with her
               head between her knees. It appeared like she might vomit. As
               they saw me approaching Joner stood up and they started
               walking, with Joner's friend again holding her arm to help her.
               I asked if they could stop to talk to me and they agreed. I
               asked Joner how much she had to drink and she said "not that
               much". I could smell the odor of intoxicants on her breath as
               she spoke to me. I asked if she had any ID on her and she said
               no. She provided me with her name and date of birth, which
               confirmed she was under 21 and was confirmed through Dispatch.
               I asked if I could check her eyes and she agreed. I
               administered a horizontal gaze nystagmus test on her and
               observed she had a lack of smooth pursuit, a distinct and
               sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation, and an onset of
               nystagmus prior to 45 degrees. Joner swayed side to side during
               the test. I advised Joner I would be forwarding charges to the
               Whitman County Prosecutor's office for MIP Exhibiting and she
               was released. Nothing further. I certify and declare under

               standing and sitting against a railing. She was leaning very
               far backward over the railing and then leaned forward while
               looking at her cell phone hunched over. It appeared she was
               going to fall and was obvious she was intoxicated and she
               appeared to be under 21. I turned around and as I approached
               Schilb was walking westbound from the bagle shop. She was
               having difficulty walking, stumbling from side to side as she
               walked. I asked Schilb to stop and talk to me, which she did.
               She stumbled twice from a standing position as I started to
               speak with her. I asked how much she had to drink and she said,
               "not a lot". She spoke with slurred speech and I could smell a
               strong odor of intoxicants on her breath. I asked if I could
               check her eyes and she agreed. I administered a horizontal gaze
               nystagmus test on her. I observed she had a lack of smooth
               pursuit, a distinct and sustained nystagmus, and an immediate
               onset of nystagmus. I had to remind Schilb not to move her head
               during the test and she swayed side to side during the test. I
               asked Schilb if she had ID with her and she did not. She
               provided me with her name and date of birth, which confirmed
               she was under 21 and was confirmed through Dispatch. She
               finally told me she thought she had approximately 1/2 of a 5th
               of alcohol. I asked if she would provide a breath sample on a
               PBT and she agreed. She provided a sample of .218 on Alco-
               Sensor FST #5493. I advised her I would be forwarding charges
               to the Whitman County Prosecutor's Office for minor intoxicated
               in a public place. I escorted Schilb to her room to make sure
               she arrived to the correct room safely, since she had
               difficulty telling me what her room number was. Her sister, who
               was not identified, was in the room and agreed to watch her.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 12 day of January, 2016, in
               Pullman, Washington. _______________________________________

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0145 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched to an
               agency assist for Pullman PD. Subject had been reportedly
               stumbling in the road walking on Main St. Officers arrived on

               Baran/07-14-97 Warned/Student Minor Exhibiting/Alcohol 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 01-12-16 at approximately 0019 hours Dispatch
               advised Pullman Police Department was requesting an agency
               assist for an intoxication call. Dispatch advised a male
               subject was stumbling into the roadway heading eastbound on
               Main St. Dispatch described the subject as a white male wearing
               a hat and talking on his cell phone. The male was last seen
               approximately 10 minutes before it was reported. Officer Welter
               and I drove around the area. I located a male standing on the
               side of the roadway of highway 270 right near the corner of
               Forest Way. I never saw the male enter the roadway, but he was
               standing on the shoulder. I exited my patrol vehicle and
               contacted the male, who was later identified as Atakan E. Baran
               (DOB 07-14-97). As I approached Baran told me he was just
               trying to get home to WSU. I asked him if he had been walking
               out in the roadway, and he said no. He told me he just got
               dropped off there a little bit ago. Baran had bloodshot and
               watery eyes and I could smell the strong odor of intoxicants
               coming from his breath. Baran had trouble standing still
               without losing his balance and had slurred and repetitive
               speech. I asked Baran how old he was, and he said 18. I told
               Baran he was being audio and video recorded. I asked Baran how
               much he had to drink tonight, and he said he had a couple.
               Baran said he had been drinking at his fraternity earlier, and
               then later went to Phi Delts and drank there as well. I asked
               Baran how he ended up on the side of the highway, and he said
               he honestly does not remember. Baran told me he thought he had
               been walking towards Rogers Hall. I asked him if he would be
               willing to take a voluntary preliminary breath test (PBT), and
               he said he would. I asked him what he had been drinking, and he
               said Vodka. Baran told me he had a lot of shots of Vodka. I
               asked Baran multiple basic questions and he was able to answer
               them accurately. He provided me a breath sample of .205. I told
               Baran I would not be forwarding criminal charges on him, but he
               would be referred to WSU Student Conduct, and he said he
               understood. I told Baran I would give him a ride to his dorm
               Rogers Hall, but I would have to search him before he went in
               my patrol vehicle. Baran gave me consent to search him before

               he got in the back of my vehicle. I dropped Baran off at Rogers
               Hall, and he shook my hand and thanked me. I told Baran if I
               saw him outside again tonight that he would be arrested, and he
               said he understood. I watched Baran walk through the main
               entrance. Baran was polite and cooperative throughout our
               encounter. I cleared the scene. No further action. My Vievu
               camera was activated, and the video was later downloaded into
               the permanent digital evidence folder. I certify and declare

               was intoxicated and vomiting in Gannon 606. I responded and
               determined the subject was not in need of medical attention.
               Medics were canceled and the subject left in the care of his

               Ambulance for an intoxicated person in Gannon 606. The subject
               was reported to be very intoxicated and vomiting. I responded
               and upon arriving at room 606 spoke to the subject, Geoffrey A.
               Hughes (061797), who was sitting up in a chair near a garbage
               can. Hughes was able to speak with me and answer all my
               questions. He was intoxicated but able to care for himself. His
               roommate, Ryan N. Anhold (031294), was present and appeared to
               be sober. Anhold thought Hughes stopped drinking approximately
               2 hours prior to my arrival. I had Dispatch cancel the medic's
               response as they were not needed. Anhold said he was staying
               with Hughes for the night and would keep an eye on him. Nothing

               Timmarica D. Spellman/091595 Fwd Chgs MIP Exhibiting 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 01/12/16 at about 0116 hrs I was driving
               westbound on Colorado St. passing Valhalla Bar when I noticed a
               group of three females walking eastbound along Colorado St.
               they caught my attention because two of the females, who were
               not identified, were walking on either side of the third
               holding her arms to help her walk. The female in the middle,
               later identified as Tammarica D. Spellman (091595), appeared to
               be under 21 and was having difficulty walking, stumbling side
               to side. I turned around and contacted the group as they passed
               the lower soccer field on Cougar Way. I asked Spellman if she
               could stop to talk to me and she did so. I asked how much she
               had to drink and she said, "I'm good". I asked how old she was
               and she said, "20". I asked again how much she had to drink and
               she said she didn't know. I asked if I could check her eyes and
               she agreed. I administered a horizontal gaze nystagmus test on
               her and observed she had bloodshot and watery eyes, a lack of
               smooth pursuit, and a distinct and sustained nystagmus at
               maximum deviation. I could smell the odor of intoxicants on her
               breath as I administered the test. I asked if she had any ID
               with her and she said no. She provided me with her name and
               date of birth, which I confirmed through Dispatch. The
               information provided indicated she was under 21. I asked if she
               would provide a breath sample and she refused. Spellman swayed
               side to side as I spoke to her. I advised her I would be
               forwarding charges to the Whitman County Prosecutor's Office
               for MIP Exhibiting and she was released. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
