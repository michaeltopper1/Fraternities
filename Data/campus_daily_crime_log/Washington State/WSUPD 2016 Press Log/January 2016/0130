    Narrative: RVWD:MTK/336 OFC: JAK/333 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0486 SYNOPSIS: A WSU student wanted a
               LAB unlocked so he could study for an exam. I informed the
               student I could not unlock the LAB. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 01-30-16, Jeremyah R. Johnson
               (08-13-84) called dispatch wanting to have an anatomy lab in
               McCoy Hall (201s/202) unlocked so he could study for an exam. I
               called Johnson and asked him what was going on. He said he is a
               Vet student and has been taking a 2 year anatomy class at WSU.
               He said he needs to study for an exam and needed to get into
               the anatomy lab, located in McCoy Hall (201s/202). He said the
               lab is usually unlocked. He said there is even a note on the
               lab door that says the lab is to remain unlocked in the
               evenings and on the weekends unless otherwise posted. I told
               him I would do some checking and get back to him within 15 to
               20 minutes. I contacted WSU Facilities Operations and asked
               them if they were aware of the specific hours the anatomy lab,
               located in McCoy Hall (201s/202), was supposed to be unlocked.
               The Facilities Operations dispatched looked through her list
               and said McCoy Hall is supposed to be locked on the weekends.
               She said she did not have any special instructions for the
               anatomy lab. I spoke with Sgt. Kuhrt about the situation and he
               tried contacting a few people he knows who might have known
               about the hours of the anatomy lab. After approximately 15
               minutes, Sgt. Kuhrt had not received any responses from his
               inquires. I called Johnson back and explained the situation to
               him. I apologized and told him I was not going to be able to
               unlock the lab for him. At approximately 1030 hours, I received
               a radio call from Whitcom asking me to call WSU Facilities
               Operations. I called and spoke with the WSU Facilities
               Operations dispatcher. She said she received a phone call from
               Dr. Cynthia Faux. She is a Professor for the WSU Vet program.
               She advised the Anatomy Lab; which is located in 202 McCoy
               Hall, is supposed to be unlocked and open 24 hours a day for
               the Vet students. Dr. Faux is not sure why the door to the Lab
               was locked and requested someone open it for the students. I
               responded to the Anatomy Lab in McCoy Hall and found the Lab
               already unlocked. An unidentified student came to meet me and
               said another Professor (also unidentified) had already unlocked
               the door. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 30th day of January,
               2016, in Pullman, Washington.

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC:MTK/336 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #:16-W0490 SYNOPSIS: Three subjects contacted
               at Bear Pens. Determined to be parking in the lot to access
               USDA Arboretum to photograph. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 01/30/16 at approximately 1110
               hours I was turning onto Animal Sciences Rd from Terreview. I
               noticed a vehicle pull into the parking lot of the bear pens.
               This caught my attention because I noticed the occupants of the
               vehicle exit and walk away from the facility. I turned around
               and when I got to the parking lot I noticed the three males
               were now crossing the street towards SR 270. When I parked in
               the lot I noticed a bucket next to the driver's door. At this
               time two additional vehicles pulled into the lot, both
               containing college aged students. I exited my car to look at
               the bucket and the other two cars quickly left their parking
               spots and turned onto Grimes Way. I found nothing in the
               bucket, so I caught up to the vehicles on Stadium Way at Wilson
               Rd. (it appeared as they were traveling at a high rate of speed
               to get this far ahead of me). I ran the plates and returned to
               the bear pens. I located the three males walking along a trail
               at the USDA Arboretum. I parked at the USDA facility and
               attempted to intercept them, but they began returning to their
               vehicle. Ofc. Kirshner contacted the three and determined they
               were taking photos of plants and the such at the Arboretum.
               They showed Ofc. Kirshner the photos and he did not notice
               anything suspicious about the photos. The group said they did
               not know the other vehicles that pulled into the lot, but also
               said it was suspicious that they left when I exited my vehicle.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 31st day of January, 2016, in

    Narrative: RVWD: Boyd/335 OFC: DBT/321 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0494 SYNOPSIS: Subject was pulled over
               for not having their headlights turned on near Cougar Way and
               Stadium Way. The driver was cited and released for DWLS 3rd.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Tikki Tong/05-20-93
               Cited and Released DWLS 3rd 6Z0246986 2. NARRATIVE: On 01-30-16
               at approximately 1957 hours I was on patrol in the area of
               Cougar Way near Northside Residence, when I observed a red,
               2006 Chevrolet Cobalt (WA Lic. AJV0538) with their headlights
               not turned on. The vehicle was headed northeast on Cougar Way.
               I turned around and I activated my emergency lights, and I
               stopped the vehicle for the above described violation on Cougar
               Way near Flag Lane. As I approached the Chevrolet I saw the
               tabs were also displayed as February, 2015. I activated my
               Vievu camera and contacted the driver of the vehicle, who was
               later identified as Tikki Tong (DOB 05-20-93). Tong immediately
               told me that he just realized he did not have his headlights
               on. I told him I was recording, and that was the reason I had
               pulled him over. I told him I also noticed his vehicle tabs
               were displayed improperly. I asked Tong for his driver's
               license, vehicle registration, and proof of insurance. Tong
               told me he did not have his driver's license with him because
               he forgot his wallet. He provided me with the vehicle title,
               but was unable to provide me with his vehicle registration. He
               was unable to provide me with proof of insurance. I went back
               to my patrol vehicle, and I asked Dispatch to run Tong for a
               records check. Dispatch advised Tong's Washington driver's
               instruction permit was suspended in the third degree in
               Washington for failure to appear on an unpaid traffic ticket.
               Dispatch also told me his vehicle tabs expired in February of
               2015. I went back and contacted Tong, and I explained to him I
               would be issuing him a criminal citation for driving while
               license suspended. When I asked him if he knew his driver's
               license was suspended, he told me he did and that he needed to
               get a new one. I asked him if his passenger would be able to
               drive away his vehicle, and he said no. I told Tong to call
               someone with a valid driver's license that could drive his
               vehicle away. I issued Tong Sector Criminal Citation #6Z0246986
               for driving while license suspended in the third degree. I
               provided Tong with his copy of the citation and I explained the
               instructions on the citation. Tong told me his first name was
               "Tikki" and his last name was "Tong", since his driver's return
               came back as "Tik Ki Tong" I had to change it for the sector
               citation so it would accept it. I also wrote him a correction

               notice for his proof of insurance and expired tabs. I explained
               to Tong he had ten days to come by the WSU Public Safety
               Building with his current proof of insurance along with his
               vehicle registration. Tong told me he would take care of it. I
               wrote him a written warning for no driver's license on person.
               Since Tong's vehicle was not safely off the roadway, I asked
               him if WSUPD Intern Jordan Chase may park his vehicle for him
               in a nearby parking lot. Tong gave Intern Chase permission to
               park his vehicle. Intern Chase parked his vehicle in the

               E. McWhirter/060796 Fwd Chgs MIP Exhibiting 2. NARRATIVE: On
               01/31/16 at about 0025 hrs I was driving eastbound on Cougar
               Way between Global Scholars Hall and Northside Residence Hall
               when I noticed a male and female, later identified as Scott E.
               McWhirter and Bryn M. Justis, walking eastbound along Cougar
               Way. They caught my attention because McWhirter appeared to be
               under 21 and was having clear difficulty walking, stumbling
               side to side in addition to having his arm around Justis for
               balance. I stopped and contacted McWhirter as they passed
               Northside Hall. I told him I was concerned with how much he had
               to drink and asked how much he had. He told me he didn't have
               that much. I noticed McWhirter spoke with slurred speech and
               had a strong odor of intoxicants on his breath. He swayed side
               to side as he stood speaking with me. I asked him if I could
               check his eyes to see how much he had to drink and he agreed. I
               administered a horizontal gaze nystagmus test on him. I
               observed he had bloodshot and watery eyes, and a lack of smooth
               pursuit in both eyes. He stopped following my pen and stared
               straight ahead at this point in the test so I stopped the test.
               I asked for his ID and he provided me with his WA driver's
               license, which confirmed he was under 21. I asked if he had
               ever been in trouble for drugs or alcohol before and he said he
               had. I told him I would be forwarding charges to the Whitman
               County Prosecutor's office. He argued with me about why I was
               harassing him and I explained that I contacted him because he
               was intoxicated to the point I noticed him and could see he was
               intoxicated while driving down the street. I asked if he would
               provide a breath sample on a pbt and he agreed. He provided a
               sample of .268 on Alco Sensor FST #5493. I told McWhirter again
               I would be forwarding charges for MIP Exhibiting and he was
               released. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 31 day of January,

               approximately 0032 hours, I was driving to check on an event at
               Ensminger Pavilion when I observed a vehicle at the east end of
               the building. The vehicle was a Jeep and it was half way up the
               grass embankment. I turned to pull into the parking lot when I
               observed the Jeep drive up the grass embankment and over the
               sidewalk to the street. I turned around and pulled up to the
               Jeep and activated my emergency lights. The Jeep pulled into a
               parking spot on Wilson Rd. I activated my VieVu camera and
               contacted the driver who I advised I was recording the traffic
               stop. I asked him why he just damaged the grass and he stated
               he was driving a jeep and just wanted to drive up the hill. I
               asked him for his driver's license and he was identified as
               Philly M. Mpima by his WA Driver's License. While speaking with
               Philly, I could smell the odor of intoxicants emitting from the
               vehicle. There were three passengers in the vehicle. I asked
               Philly if he had been drinking tonight and he stated he had a
               shot about three hours ago. I asked Philly to square his
               shoulders to me in the vehicle so I could look at his eyes and
               he did. I did a couple of passes with my finger and watched his
               eyes. Based on how he was positioned in the driver's seat, I
               was unable to fully watch his eyes. Charges pending

               returned any phone calls, the investigation continues. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 01-31-16 at
               approximately 0207 hours I was dispatched to a third party
               report of a possible assault that occurred near the Global
               Scholars Market, located at 1302 NE Cougar Way. Dispatch
               advised the complainant, Jacqui M. Lacroix (DOB 11-19-90), said
               a male approached her and asked for video footage from the
               Global Scholars Market because his former roommate struck him.
               I called Lacroix on the phone around 0214 hours. She told me
               she works for WSU dinning services, and around 0200 hours a
               male came and knocked on the northeast entrance door to the
               Market. Lacroix told me she opened the door, and the male
               identified himself as Jarett B. Allen (DOB 12-23-95). Lacroix
               said he requested video footage because he said his former
               roommate assaulted him around midnight. Lacroix said Allen told
               her that his former roommate punched him in the left side of
               his face. I asked Lacroix if Allen appeared to have any
               injuries on his face, and she said the left side of his face
               looked red and swollen. Although, she mentioned Allen appeared
               highly intoxicated and was unsure if the redness on his face
               was due to alcohol consumption. I asked Lacroix if she
               mentioned anything to him about contacting the police, and she
               said yeah. She told Allen to contact the police, but he
               mentioned something about his former roommate being close with
               Pullman Police Department. He told her he already had pending
               assault charges on him because of his roommate, and that he did
               not want to contact PPD again. She told me his roommates name
               was "Phil". Allen had provided Lacroix with his phone number. I
               tried calling Allen several different times, but he was not
               answering his phone. His voicemail box was not setup. I checked
               the cameras outside of the Global Scholars Market, but was
               unable to witness any assault occur. The investigation
               continues. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 31st day of January, 2016, in Pullman,

               Perham Hall outside. I advised Dispatch that Borden did not
               need to be seen by medics and they could cancel to respond to
               the other call. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 31 day of
               January, 2016, in Pullman, Washington.

               photographs were taken. The investigation continues. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 01-31-16 at
               approximately 0341 hours I was dispatched to the report of
               malicious mischief on the 8th floor of Rogers Hall, located at
               1355 SE Olympia Ave. Dispatch advised the complainant said
               there was graffiti from a black sharpie. I arrived on scene. I
               met with the Resident Advisor (RA) on duty, Ernest W. Sonido
               (DOB 04-02-96). As I was riding elevator #1 up to the 8th floor
               I noticed there was black sharpie written all over the inside
               of the elevator doors. Someone had written "fuck" on the left
               side of the door and "IX" on the right side of the door in
               black sharpie. There was also "13" written on the right inside
               wall of the elevator. I asked Sonido if that was all new
               graffiti, and he said yes. The outside doors on the 8th floor
               elevator #1 also had black sharpie on them, the left side had
               scribbles and the write side had a large "IX" written on it.
               Sonido told me there was a lot more similar graffiti throughout
               the floor. Sonido told me him and the other RA on duty, Alexis
               M. Franklin (DOB 08-24-96) had finished their last round of the
               hall about 0150 hours. Sonido said none of the graffiti had
               been there. He told me he received around 0320 hours from one
               of his resident's on the 8th floor who had gotten up to get a
               drink of water and noticed all of the graffiti. The 8th floor
               elevator lobby also had black sharpie written on the wall
               between the two elevators. The number "13" appeared again.
               There was also "yee" and some other sribbles that I could not
               read. I asked Sonido if him or the other hall staff knew who
               may have been responsible for the damage. Sonido told me they
               thought it may have been Jonathan W. White (DOB 09-20-96) or
               Nicholas S. Smith (DOB 05-21-97) who both live in Rogers Hall
               room #839. Sonido told me White had been responsible for
               damaging the 8th floor in the past. **REPORT NOT FINISHED**
