               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0463 SYNOPSIS: A WSU student was taken
               into custody for a Warrant Arrest. He was transported and
               booked into the Whitman County Jail. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. William C. Lieberg Arrested / Booked Warrant
               Arrest 09-09-87 2. NARRATIVE: On 01-27-16, Officer Jones handed
               me a copy of a Misdemeanor Warrant for William C. Lieberg (09-
               09-87). The Warrant was for "Failure to Appear for Hearing"
               regarding WSU Police Case #15-W6009. I was able to determine
               Lieberg is a current WSU student and had class on the morning
               of 01-29-16. At 0810 hours, he was supposed to have class in
               Fulmer Hall, room 125. I responded to Fulmer Hall and made
               contact with Lieberg in room 125. I asked him to come into the
               hallway so I could speak with him. I advised him he had a
               Warrant for his arrest and I had to take him into custody. He
               said he had a test during his class and asked if there was any
               way he could take the test prior to being taken into custody. I
               told him I was more than happy to speak with his Professor to
               see if we could make other arraignments. We were able to speak
               with his Professor and he said he could make the test up. I
               walked Lieberg outside of Fulmer Hall and had Whitcom confirm
               and locate the Warrant. Once they advised it was confirmed, I
               placed Lieberg under Arrest for a misdemeanor Warrant. I placed
               him in handcuffs, read him his Miranda Rights, and told him he
               was under Arrest for the misdemeanor warrant. I told him the
               Warrant was for failing to appear for his court hearing. He
               said he understood. I drove Lieberg to the Whitman County Jail,
               in Colfax, Washington. Once at the jail, I read Lieberg a copy
               of the actual Bench Warrant. He again said he understood.
               Lieberg was left in the custody of the Whitman County Jail
               Staff. While searching Lieberg's backpack, we discovered a wood
               smoking device/container; which contained .58 grams of GVM
               (believed to be marijuana) and a copper smoking pipe. I took
               possession of the device/container. Once back at the WSU Police
               Department, I logged the device/container and it's .58 grams of
               marijuana into evidence. The items were stored in evidence
               locker 14. The marijuana was marked to be destroyed and the
               device/container as safekeeping. The device/container can be
               returned to Lieberg if he chooses to come retrieve it. A copy
               of the Bench Warrant Arrest paperwork was hand delivered to the
               WSU Records staff as well as one was placed in the case file. I
               contacted the WSU Office of the Dean of Students and advised
               them of the arrest as Lieberg mentioned he had missed some
               school due to being ill. He was concerned as he had home work

               they would send out a courtesy e-mail to all of Lieberg's
               Professors advising them of the situation. Nothing further. I

               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 01/29/16 at
               approximately 0825 hours I was dispatched to the report of a
               vehicle prowl on SE Olympia Ave near McEachern. The reporting
               party, Eric Carlson, said his vehicle had been broken into and
               items taken. Carlson was not on scene for contact, but I was in
               the area. I stopped by and photographed the vehicle (WA 352YLC)
               which was parked on the south side of Olympia Ave across from
               McEachern Hall. I did not see any noticeable damage to the
               vehicle. I contacted Carlson and asked what happened. Carlson
               said that his vehicle was broken into (presumably the night
               before) and several items were taken. I asked Carlson how
               access was gained to his vehicle and he said it appeared as if
               someone was able to pry open his passenger window and unlock
               the door. Carlson said a pair of sunglasses, an IPOD, and an
               IPOD charger was taken. I asked Carlson when he thought it
               happened. Carlson said the last time he was at his vehicle was
               early Monday morning, but since there was no precipitation in
               his vehicle he assumed it happened the night before. There was
               heavy rainfall in the area until approximately 2100 hours on
               01/28/16. I asked Carlson if there was any damage to his
               vehicle and he said he did not see any. Carlson provided me
               with the serial number for the IPOD and I entered it into NCIC.
               No suspects or leads. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 29th day of January,

               01/29/16 at approximately 0930 hours I was dispatched to a
               welfare check on the 2nd floor of Coman Hall. The reporting
               party, Ming Wagoner (Scott Hall RA), was reporting two males
               sleeping on the floor of the hallway on the 2nd floor of Coman
               Hall. Ming relayed that the on duty RA let the two subjects in
               the hall the night before (even though they did not live there)
               and now they would not get in the room where they were staying
               with a friend. Ofc. Kirshner and I responded. I found two
               subjects, Brayton W. Anderson & Caleb R. Robichaud, asleep in
               the hallway in front of room 205. I woke them up and asked what
               they were doing. Caleb explained that they were staying with
               Sam (resident of 205). Caleb said that Sam, Brayton, himself,
               and two other friends came back to Sam's room around 0400
               hours. Caleb said that he and Brayton went into the stairwell
               to hang out and when they returned to the room (at
               approximately 0700 hours) no one would answer the door. While
               Caleb and Brayton spoke (although Brayton didn't speak much), I
               could smell the odor of intoxicants on their breath. I asked if
               there was any reason I needed to make entry into Sam's room to
               check on him. I asked Caleb if Sam was extremely intoxicated
               the night before and he said no. I told Caleb that since Sam
               was not around he and Brayton would have to wait outside. I
               told both subjects that if they were found in the hall
               unescorted, they would be arrested for Trespassing. I warned
               them that they were technically trespassing presently. I
               escorted the two from the hall and cleared. I spoke with the
               on-duty RED (Richard Wallace) and relayed my concern about hall
               staff allowing non residents into the hall after hours. Wallace
               said he would handle it. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 29th day of January,

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0472 SYNOPSIS: A WSU Assistant Professor
               reported a male watching her class from the back of the room.
               She thought the male's activity was suspicious. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 01-29-16, WSU
               Assistant Professor, Porismita Borah (10-23-72), called Whitcom
               stating she wanted to report suspicious activity which occurred
               on 01-28-16. Borah said she was teaching a class in Sloan Hall,
               room 233 from 1035 hours until 1150 hours on 01-28-16. She said
               sometime around 1045 hours, a white male came into her
               classroom and stood at the back of the room. She said the male
               was making her uncomfortable so she confronted him. She wanted
               to speak with an Officer about the male's behavior. I contacted
               Borah via telephone and asked her to describe what happened.
               She said she contacted the above mentioned male and asked him
               what he was doing. She said the male told her he was
               considering auditing her class. She told the male there was a
               procedure which needs to be followed if someone wants to
               consider auditing a class. The male stated he understood and
               left the classroom. Borah said the male came back to the
               classroom approximately 7 minutes later and again stood at the
               back of the room just watching. She approached the male again
               and asked him to leave the room, which he did. Borah said she
               was not afraid of the male, but thought his actions were
               strange. She said she knows she should have called on the day
               of the occurrence, but said she had so many meetings she just
               couldn't make it happen. I advised she should call us
               immediately if this happens in the future. She described the
               person as: White with a beard and being of average build. She
               said he was wearing blue jeans and a grey sweatshirt. she said
               that was all she could remember as she was a little frazzled.
               Borah said she was going to send an e-mail out to her
               department asking if anyone else was experiencing similar type
               of behavior and would get back to me if needed. Nothing further
               at this time. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 29th day of January, 2016, in

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0473 SYNOPSIS: A WSU student received
               one text message she felt was harassing in nature. No crime of
               harassment appears to have been committed. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 01-29-16, at
               approximately 1427 hours, Marivel A. Venegas (08-22-96) called
               Whitcom stating she has been harassed on an ongoing basis since
               moving from Stephenson East. Venegas moved from Stephenson East
               on or around 01-17-16. I called Venegas and asked her to tell
               me what was going on and what I could do for her. She said she
               had to move from Stephenson East earlier in the month because
               several girls were accusing her of stealing their cloths.
               Venegas said it was just easier to move out than to deal with
               everything going on. She said Sgt,. Griffin advised her to
               "Block" the phone numbers of those girls who were accusing her
               of stealing. She said she did "Block" these girls. Venegas said
               she received a text message on 01-28-16, from a girl who is the
               best friend one of the girls Venegas had "Blocked". She said
               the text stated something to the effect of "I know you stole my
               clothes. You have until tonight to give them back or I'm
               calling the Police". Venegas said she does not have any cloths
               that belong to anyone else and had tried telling everyone this
               prior to her moving from Stephenson East, but said they would
               not listen. Venegas said she did not feel like the text was a
               big deal and was not sure if she should even call the Police,
               but said if she told her mother what was going on, her mother
               would "Freak Out" and call the cops. At the end of our
               conversation, Venegas asked if she was just being dramatic
               about the whole situation. I told her it was impossible for me
               to know what people will or will not do prior to it happening.
               I told her she should feel free to call the Police any time she
               felt it was appropriate. I told her it did not appear to be
               Harassment based upon what she told me, but I needed to see the
               actual text to be certain. I asked her for he e-mail address so
               I could send her a request of questions I needed her to answer.
               She told me I could send the request to her via
               Marivel00@yahoo.com. At approximately 1500 hours, I sent the e-
               mail. On 01-29-16, at approximately 1520 hours, Vanegas sent an
               e-mail back to me with screen shots taken from Snapchat. The
               message was from 9;20 PM and read: "so I know you came into my
               room before you moved out and stole a shit ton more of my
               clothes. If they are not ALL given back to me by tonight I will
               file a police report against you and I have proof so I would
               not tempt me. I'm done playing games Marivel and I know you did

               Police Department and wanted to speak with an Officer. I met
               Lessin in the front lobby of the Police Department and asked

               Jones and he handed me a check. He explained Officer Jones told
               him he had to pay money back for a check he mistakenly
               deposited into his account (see WSU Case #16-W0407). I looked
               at the case and it appears as if Officer Jones wanted Lessin to
               make the re-payment to US Bank. The case did not say; however,
               who Lessin was supposed to talk to at the bank or which account
               money was supposed to be deposited into. I tried calling
               Officer Jones, but was unable to reach him. I gave Lessin the
               check back and advised him he needed to come back on Monday
               (02-01-16) so he can contact Officer Jones for further

               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 01-29-2016 at about
               1818 hrs I was dispatched to a report of the odor of burning
               marijuana originating from Rogers Hall #237, located at 1355 SE
               Olympia Avenue. I arrived on scene and contacted the
               complainant, Jenafer L. Doolittle (DOB 07-09-1988), in the
               hallway. Doolittle is the hall director for Orton Hall.
               Doolittle said she had detected the faint odor of marijuana
               coming from the room but could no longer smell it. I approached
               the door to room #237 but could not detect the odor of
               marijuana. I knocked on the door, and it was answered by
               Jackson M. Gardner (DOB 12-23-1996). Gardner is the only person
               assigned to the room. Also in the room was Jackson's
               girlfriend, Clarissa M. Gilmore (DOB 11-16-1996). Jackson and
               Gilmore were both 19 years old. While I was speaking with
               Jackson and Gilmore, I did not detect the odor of marijuana,
               and I did not identify any signs of marijuana usage. Jackson
               and Gilmore told me they had not smoked marijuana and said they
               did not have any marijuana inside the room. I cleared the
               scene. The original report of the odor of marijuana is
               unfounded. No further action at this time. Olmstead/339 I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of

               drugs call at Rogers Hall. RED reported the odor of marijuana
               coming from a room. I contacted the resident, but was unable to
               confirm the odor of marijuana. Nothing further. NAME/DOB ACTION

               hours I was dispatched to a drugs call at Rogers Hall. RED
               Jenafer Doolittle reported the odor of marijuana coming from
               room 539. I arrived and could not smell the odor of marijuana
               coming from the door jamb of the room. I knocked on the door
               and one of the residents of the room, Tristan P. Willis,
               answered. He said he was the only one in the room. I told him I
               was there because someone reported the odor of marijuana coming
               from his room. I could still not detect the odor of marijuana
               coming from the room even with the door open. I asked Willis if
               there was any marijuana in the room. He said there was not. I
               asked if he had a medical marijuana card he said he did not.
               Willis gave me his date of birth and he was under 21. Willis
               said he had been at a fraternity where they were smoking
               marijuana, and that is where the smell may have come from. He
               also admitted to drinking alcohol at the fraternity. Willis was
               very nervous his hand was shaking when he got out his
               identification, his voice cracked when he talked and he would
               not make eye contact with me. He appeared to be staring at one
               spot on my chest. I again asked if he had any marijuana or drug
               paraphernalia in the room, he said there was not. I explained
               that he was under twenty and it was illegal to possesses or
               consume alcohol or marijuana, he said he understood. I cleared.
               I was unable to confirm the odor of marijuana. Nothing further.
               I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws
               of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 30th day of January, 2016, in Pullman,
