               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0075 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched
               to a non-injury vehicle collision on Stadium Way. I arrived on
               scene and determined there was no damage. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 01-08-2016 at about
               1818 hrs I was dispatched to a report of a non-injury vehicle
               collision involving a Pullman Transit bus on Stadium Way near
               Bustad Hall. Dispatch advised that the bus was parked at the
               bus stop located on Stadium Way near Bustad Hall and south of
               the intersection of Grimes Way. I arrived on scene and
               contacted the transit driver, who was identified as Erik T.
               Carter (DOB 01-12-1967). Carter told me he is a bus driver for
               Pullman Transit and was the driver of a 2005 Gillig transit bus
               (WA Lic. 41703D). Carter said at about 1809 hrs he stopped his
               bus at the bus stop on Stadium Way. Carter heard a sound coming
               from outside and looked out the driver side window of the bus.
               Carter said another bus was traveling past his location in the
               outside northbound lane of Stadium Way. Carter noticed that the
               side view mirror on the driver side of his bus was out of
               adjustment. Carter speculated that the other bus must have
               struck the mirror as it drove past his location and then
               continued northbound on Stadium Way. Carter checked the mirror
               on his bus and determined it was not damaged. Carter described
               the other bus as brown and green in color, possibly with the
               WSU Cougar logo. Carter admitted that he was not sure what the
               other bus looked like and could not remember. I photographed
               Carter's bus and the mirror. The photographs were downloaded
               into Spillman and attached to this case. Officers Westerman and
               Petlovany checked the area for the other bus, and the video
               surveillance footage from Stadium Way and Grimes Way was
               reviewed, however, the other bus was not identified. No further
               action at this time. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this _09__ day of
               ___January___, 2016, in Pullman, Washington.
