    Narrative: RVWD: AE/330 OFC:MTK/336 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #:16-W0272 SYNOPSIS: Report of a scam attempt
               from a WSU email address. There was no crime that occurred on
               WSU Campus, but the reporting party wanted me to be aware of
               the use of a @wsu.edu email address. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 01/18/16 at approximately 0930
               hours I was dispatched to the report of a fraud. The reporting
               party was a police officer with the Salem, VA police
               department. I called the reporting party, Lt. Troy Thomas, and
               asked how I could help. Thomas told me his wife received an
               email from michael.cahill@wsu.edu on January 13th. The email
               only said "Can we talk". Thomas said his wife responded and
               asked if she knew who the person was. Thomas said his wife then
               got an email from a subject claiming to be with the US Marine
               Corp offering to share a large sum of money. Thomas said the
               email was clearly a scam attempt, but no further correspondence
               was done. Thomas said his main concern was that someone might
               have hacked into the wsu email account. I told Thomas that
               there has been many recent attempts to get WSU members to
               respond to fraudulent emails. I thanked Thomas for his time and
               he emailed me the emails his wife received. I sent an email to
               WSU IT Securities notifying them of the possible breach on
               Michael Cahill's account. I did not get the reporting parties
               full information, or his wife's. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               18th day of January, 2016, in Pullman, Washington.

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Edwards/330 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0277 SYNOPSIS: Cassens reported that
               Scofield violated the temporary protection order between them.
               It was determined that no violation occurred. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 01-18-16 at about 1416
               hours I was dispatched to the report of an order violation that
               had just occurred at the SRC. The RP, Katrina Cassens, was at
               the SRC for contact. While enroute, Whitcom confirmed that
               there was an active no-contact order between Cassens and
               Matthew Scofield. I contacted Cassens near the entrance to the
               SRC. She explained that she was inside the SRC with her
               personal trainer, participating in a scheduled training
               session. Cassens said that while she was working out, she
               looked across the room and saw Matthew Scofield. She said they
               made eye contact and she mouthed to him "you need to leave".
               She said Scofield turned around and left the SRC. She confirmed
               that Scofield did not speak to her or make any other contact
               with her. Cassens believed that this interaction was a
               violation of the no-contact order in place. I read over the
               order on my MDC with Cassens standing at my car door. I noticed
               the order said that Scofield is prohibited from coming within
               300 feet of Cassens home or work or any place public or private
               that he knows her to be. I asked Cassens if Scofield knew she
               was there and she said she doesn't know. Cassens believed the
               order included "school" as a prohibited place, but I did not
               see "school" listed in the order. Cassens told me that after
               she saw Scofield she texted the friend he was with, Justyn
               Cruz. She said Justyn witnessed the entire incident. The text
               conversation was as follows: Cassens: Matthew is not to be
               within 100 ft of my work, school or home. WUS is considered my
               school. He is in violation of a restraining order by coming
               here. Cassens: Police have been notified. I am a student, he is
               not. Therefore he is not to be here, especially knowing that I
               am doing personal training sessions here. Cruz: You are fucking
               crazy! Don't contact me again and don't stalk him so he can't
               do stuff, if I need to I will help him fight this bullshit
               you're putting him through. Cruz: I will go to the police and
               get this all straightened out if I need to. Cassens: I am not
               stalking him. I was here first. And I am a student, I pay to
               use the Rec and I am allowed to be here. He's not a student
               therefore he is not to be here, he can find another gym. And go
               ahead and go to the police. If you would like to come back by
               yourself and talk to them I'm sure they would love to hear
               excuses. I'm here now talking to them. **End of text

               conversation** I told Cassens I would contact Scofield and ask
               him about what happened today. I confirmed with her that as
               soon as he saw her he turned around and left the gym. She said
               that was correct. I ended my contact with Casssens and called
               Pullman Police Department to determine if there was anything
               else in the order that was not listed. There was no additional
               information in the actual order than what appeared on the NCIC
               return. I called Scofield. I asked him if I could meet him
               somewhere to discuss what happened at the SRC today. He said
               that was fine and he would be at Chinook Apartment D22 for
               contact. Officer Olmstead and I went to apartment D22 to
               contact Scofield. Present at the apartment was Scofield, Justyn
               Cruz and Shinea Moss. I advised I was recording and read
               Scofield his Miranda Rights. He stated he understood his rights
               and verbally waived them. I asked him to tell me what happened
               today at the SRC. He said that he was at the SRC with Justyn
               working out. He told me they had been there for about 50
               minutes when he saw Cassens. Scofield said that as soon as he
               made eye contact with Cassens she glared at him and he
               immediately turned around, told Justyn they had to leave, and
               they both left the area. Scofield confirmed that he did not say
               anything to Cassens. Justyn confirmed this version of events. I
               asked Scofield how he got into the SRC today, since he is not a
               student. He said that he was a "guest" of Justyn's and paid the
               $5.00 fee as a guest. I spoke with Scofield about the content
               of the no-contact order. I explained that although he is not
               prohibited from being at the SRC, he may want to avoid the area
               to eliminate any potential contact or order violation from
               occurring. He agreed that would probably be best. He said he is
               doing to best he can to stay away from her. After speaking with
               all parties involved as well as Justyn Cruz, I determined that
               no order violation had occurred. Olmstead and I left the
               apartment. I called Cassens to give her an update on what I had
               done. I clarified with her that the order does not say "school"
               and that Scofield is not prohibited from being on campus. She
               said she was going to ask the Judge to amend the order. No
               crimes occurred. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 19th day of
               January, 2016, in Pullman, Washington.

               reported that someone had shot seven windows with a pellet gun.
               The damage was old and most likely occurred over a year ago.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 01-18-
               2016 at about 1601 hrs I was dispatched to a report of a
               malicious mischief at Regents Hall, located at 1580 NE Cougar
               Way. I arrived on scene and contacted the complainant, Michelle
               C. McKay (DOB 04-17-1996). McKay is a resident advisor for
               Regents Hall. McKay directed me to the stairwell located in the
               northeast corner of Regents Hall. McKay showed me that the
               exterior walls in each stairwell landing, which are located
               between floors, have ten (10) square shaped, decorative
               windows. The windows were double paned, and this side of the
               building was positioned towards the main entrance driveway of
               Regents Hall. McKay reported that a total of seven (7) of these
               small, square shaped windows were damaged with a pellet gun.
               The damaged windows were located at the following locations:
               1st and 2nd floor landing: five (5) damaged windows 2nd and 3rd
               floor landing: one (1) damaged window 3rd and 4th floor
               landing: one (1) damaged window I examined the damaged windows
               and saw that one window had a large broken section. The others
               had small puncture holes and cracks similar to the damage
               caused by a pellet gun. It appears that someone shot the
               windows with a pellet gun from outside the building. I observed
               that the cracks, holes, and space between the double paned
               glass were covered with mold, detritus, dirt, and moisture. It
               was obvious that these windows were damaged a long time ago,
               probably around a year ago or longer. I estimated a possible
               time frame for the damage to be approximately 01-01-2015 to 06-
               01-2015. The value for each damaged window was estimated to be
               $100.00, resulting in a total damage value of $700.00. I
               photographed the damaged windows, and the photographs were
               downloaded into Spillman and attached to this case. McKay will
               notify WSU Housing Maintenance of the damaged windows. No
               suspects or leads were identified. No further action at this
               time. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this __18__ day of
               __January___, 2016, in Pullman, Washington.

               sometime between 2000 hrs and 2200 hrs on 01/15/16. No suspects
               and no leads at this time. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR#
               1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 01/18/16 around 1600 hrs I was dispatched
               to a reported burglary which had occurred previously. I
               contacted the reporting party, later identified as Dakota G
               Surovchak (03/29/95), who agreed to meet me at his apartment
               where I was told the following. Surovchak explained he had gone
               to dinner around 2000 hrs on 01/15/16 in Moscow. When he
               returned around 2200 hrs he noticed someone had entered his
               apartment from the rear sliding glass door and proceeded to his
               bedroom where several items, including his X-Box One and
               approximatley 12 games were taken. I asked Surovchak to show me
               the sliding glass door, which I noticed upon looking at it did
               not latch and secure properly. I looked around on the ground
               outside and did not immediately see anything of note before
               returning into the apartment, where I was led to Surovchak's
               bedroom. Upon entering the room I noticed clothes thrown on the
               floor along with items tipped over inside of the closet. In
               addition I noticed a flat screen tv and two laptop computers
               sitting on the floor and asked about them. Surovchak explained
               one of the laptops belonged to a friend of his and the other
               was in a backpack he had with him at the time of the theft. I
               asked if the TV was here or if he had recently moved it into
               the room and was told it had been left behind. While looking
               around the room I noticed a dress watch and other items of
               value which had not been touched. At noticing these things I
               asked Surovchak if he had been having any issues with anyone
               and told he did not. He went on to explain he had been trying
               to think of who he might have upset or who might have taken his
               stuff and hadn't thought of anyone at this time. As I continued
               looking around he added none of his roommates items, including
               the large flat screen TV sitting in the living room had been
               touched, only his items. I photographed the door which had been
               pointed out as the point of entry, since the front door had
               been locked when he left and found locked again upon his
               return. I found the locking mechanism on the sliding glass door
               didn't work and asked if he had contacted housing regarding it.
               He told me he had not, but would first thing on 01/19/16.
               Surovchak was provided with my business card and case number
               for reference and I asked him to try and obtain the serial
               number for the X-Box one and any other items which might have
               serial numbers attached to them. He told me would email me with

               list of missing items before I proceed further. I certify and

               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Jacob M. Jones/091996 Booked Assault 2nd 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 01/19/16 at about 0425 hrs Dispatch advised of a
               reported assault that occurred at Stephenson earlier in the
               evening. I contacted the complainant, Chandler W. Harper
               (061297), who told me he went to his room at about 1900 hrs on
               01/18/16. He found his roommate, Bradley, J. Stipek (040897)
               and his roommate's friend Jacob M. Jones (091996), arguing. He
               said they were both heavily intoxicated, to the point he could
               not even tell what they were arguing about. As they argued
               Jones punched Stipek in the face once and then the two "made
               up" and were friends again. This happened several more times,
               with one punch and then the two of them "making up", before
               Jones punched Stipek a final time and Stipek fell to the
               ground. Harper estimated Jones punched Stipek a total of 4
               times. Once Stipek fell on the floor Jones "stomped" Stipek's
               face with his foot and then straddled Stipek, with his legs on
               either side of Stipek's waist. He started choking Stipek with
               his right hand and as he moved his left hand down to start
               choking him with it too Harper hooked his arm under Jones' arm
               and across his neck, pulling him off Stipek. Harper forced
               Jones out of the room and locked the door. Harper told me there
               was quite a bit of blood in their room. He also told me Stipek
               did not wish to press charges and initially did not want to go
               to the hospital but was talked into it. Harper thought the
               entire incident occurred between 1900 hrs and 0215 hrs. I
               contacted Stipek at the hospital. His right eye was swollen and
               bloodshot as well as a large portion of the right side of his
               face. His nose was swollen as well and he was holding a gauze
               pad to his nose for bleeding. He told me he did not wish to
               press any charges or name any names but would tell me what
               happened. He told me was hanging out with a friend and he
               wasn't ok with how Stipek felt about everything and his face
               got "wailed on". I asked if he could give me more details about
               why he was assaulted and Stipek said "he was just done with my
               bullshit." Stipek did not want to tell me who assaulted him. He
               told me he was punched and choked. He said while he was being
               choked it did make it hard to breathe. During the Interview
               Stipek made several references to not wanting to put himself in
               a sticky situation. I asked what he meant by this and he

               referenced people at school talking. I asked if he was scared
               the suspect might do something to him and assured him we would
               make sure nothing happened should he want to make a full report
               and move forward with criminal charges. He told me he was just
               not going to have any further contact with the subject and
               insisted he did not want any charges. I took Harper with me to
               their room Stephenson South 1227 so he could show me the room.
               Harper directed me to a spot just inside and to the right of
               the door as you enter. There were two blood spots on the carpet
               which Harper said were from after the assault when Stipek was
               bleeding and they were trying to clean him up. There were
               several towels in a hamper with blood on them from cleaning
               Stipek up. There was also a spot with some blood spray, which
               Harper said was approximately where Stipek's head was when it
               was stomped on. I took Harper back to the hospital and spoke to
               Stipek one more time. I provided him with my business card and
               told him to seriously consider if he wanted to move forward
               with charges or not. I asked him if I could take photos of his
               injuries for documentation and he initially said yes but then
               asked what was going to happen with them. I told him they would
               be put with the case file and would go wherever the case file
               went. Stipek hinted that he knew his roommate told me Jones'
               name and reiterated that he did not want any charges. I told
               him he was seriously assaulted and by not moving forward with
               charges he may be putting himself or others at risk of assault
               in the future and he should consider holding the suspect
               accountable for his actions. I told him it was likely the
               suspect would be arrested for the assault that night. I spoke
               to Jones and he denied ever assaulting Stipek. He told me he
               was in his room at about 2300 hours and had just laid down on
               his bed or sat down at his computer, he could not remember
               which, when he received a call or a text message from Harper
               about Stipek and went to their room. In the communication from
               Harper Harper told him he was "Dude I cant do this, or I've had
               enough of this, this isn't cool man". Jones went to Stipek's
               room and found Stipek with a bloody nose and crying in a
               "really depressed state". Jones said Stipek was walking around
               and ran into a wall or something and was "really fucked up". As
               I was talking with Jones his right hand was very swollen around
               the knuckles and it was obvious he punched something or
               someone. I told Jones I knew what really happened and that
               Stipek didn't run into a wall. I told him I knew Jones hit,
               kicked, and choked Stipek. I told him that was obvious by
               looking at his hand and was going to give him another
               opportunity to be honest with me. Jones continued to deny
               hitting, kicking, or choking Stipek. I asked him about the
               injury to his hand and he paused to think briefly before saying
               he got mad at a friend for talking while Jones was on the phone
               and punched a wall. I told Jones again I knew that was not what
               really happened and he continued denying assaulting Stipek. I
               told Jones he was under arrest for assault and placed him in
               handcuffs (double locked). I read him his constitutional rights
               from a pre-printed card and advised him he was being recorded.
               Officer Jones transported Jones to the Whitman County Jail for
               booking. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
