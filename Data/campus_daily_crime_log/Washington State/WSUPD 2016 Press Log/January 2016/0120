               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On January 20, 2016 at
               about 0720 hours I was dispatched to an extra patrol request
               for the construction area near Waller Hall. I responded to the
               area where I contacted a representative from Perfection Traffic
               Control. Perfection Traffic Control is having issues with
               signs, barricades, and fencing being tipped over or moved
               between the hours of 1700 and 0500 hours. Perfection Traffic
               Control does not have any personnel on duty between 1700 and
               0500 hours to monitor their equipment. Their signs and
               barricades are prohibiting pedestrians from walking in front of
               Waller Hall on Nevada Street. This is the main access way to
               the core campus area for those living on the south side of
               campus. It is unknown if a person or persons are tipping over
               the signs or if it was the wind. Currently all of the signs,
               barricades and fencing are temporary and/or portable. They do
               not have any permanently mounted signs, barricades, fencing
               and/or barriers. This information will be passed on to WSU
               Police administration for further review. No further
               investigation at this time. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 20th day of January,
               2016, in Pullman, Washington.

               while on patrol. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 01/20/16 around 2240 hrs while on patrol I
               located an open gate to the farm services building on Terre
               View Dr. A check of the area, along with the Tukey Orchards
               found nothing of note. I was not able to secure the gate due to
               a rusted and clasped lock, and Facilities Operations was
               contacted. Upon their arrival the lock was eventually removed
               and we attempted to secure the gate, without success due to a
               bent pole. The gate was closed for the evening and Facilities
               Operations was aware of the issue requiring repair. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 20th day of January, 2016, in Pullman,

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Whitman / 323 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0328 SYNOPSIS: Responded to a drugs call
               at Rogers Hall. RED reported the odor of marijuana. Two
               subjects contacted, one of which was warned for possession of
               marijuana. Forward to student conduct. Nothing further.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Niaylah S. King/071897
               Warned Poss of Marijuana 2. NARRATIVE: On 01/21/16 at about
               0054 hours I was dispatched to a drugs call at Rogers Hall. The
               on call RED, Dustin Cooper, reported the odor of marijuana
               coming from room 436. Cooper while he was trying to determine
               the source of the odor a male left the room and he could smell
               the odor of marijuana coming from room 436. I arrived and
               Cooper told me the male had left the building but there was
               still voices coming from room 436. The hallway of the 4th floor
               had a strong odor of marijuana. I went to the door to room 436,
               I could hear voices inside. I smelled the door jamb, and could
               only smell a strong perfume or air freshener. I knocked on the
               door and Niaylah King answered the door. I asked King if there
               was anyone else in the room, she said no. Then her roommate,
               Crystal Chase, came to the door too. I explained I was there
               because there was a report of the odor of marijuana coming from
               their room. They said they were not smoking marijuana. I asked
               if the male that had just left came from their room. They said
               he had not, that they were just watching "Jayden Smith". I
               asked if there was any marijuana in the room, they said there
               was not. I asked if they had ever been contacted for marijuana
               or alcohol offense, they said they have not. I asked if either
               of them smoke marijuana, they both said no. I asked if I could
               get their names for my report. As I was writing down their
               information a draft came through their window and I could smell
               the odor of marijuana. I stepped to the right and could see a
               glass pipe, the type usually used to smoke marijuana, sitting
               in the window. I asked what was in the pipe, King said she was
               smoking tobacco out of it. I asked if she would let me see it,
               she said no. I asked where the marijuana smell was coming from,
               they both shook their heads that they didn't know. I then
               explained to King I was giving her a warning for possession of
               marijuana and would be sending my report to student conduct.
               King continued to deny there was marijuana in the room. I gave
               her the option to gather up all marijuana and destroy it, King
               again said there was no marijuana in the room. I contacted
               dispatch and ran King and Chase. As I ran them I recognized
               King's name. I asked her if she was contacted the night before
               at the observatory (case#16-W0306) for possession of marijuana.

               King said she was. I asked her about the contacted I had with
               her at ALIVE for marijuana. She said that was her too. I asked
               her why she lied to me, she said she was intimidated by
               officers and that is why she wasn't honest. I asked again if
               there was any marijuana in the room she wanted to destroy, she
               said after the incident last night she all her marijuana was
               stashed elsewhere. I asked King if she had a medical marijuana
               card she said she did not. I again explained to King I would be
               forwarding my report to student conduct. I asked if they had
               any questions and they said they did not. Forward to student
               conduct. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 21st day of January,
               2016, in Pullman, Washington.
