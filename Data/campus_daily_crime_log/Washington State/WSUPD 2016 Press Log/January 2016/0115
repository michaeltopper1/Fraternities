    Narrative: RVWD:MTK/336 OFC: JAK/333 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0217 SYNOPSIS: An unidentified person
               shot a nylon bb through an exterior hallway window in Regents
               Hall. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               01-15-16, I was dispatched to a Malicious Mischief at the
               Regents Complex and asked to meet staff in the Regents Complex
               lobby. I responded and met a custodian in the lobby. I was told
               there was a hole in a window on the 1st floor which looked like
               a BB was shot at it from inside the hallway. We walked to the
               1st floor of the McGregor Regents-High side of Regents hallway
               and to the NE exterior window. Nancy I. Bevan (05-19-59)
               responded to the area as she was the custodian who initially
               noticed the hole in the NE exterior window. She said she first
               saw the damage to the window on Wednesday afternoon (01-13-15)
               at approximately 1300 hours. She said she informed the Resident
               Advisor for the floor at that time. It appeared to me as if
               someone shot at the window with a BB or Pellet gun, causing a
               hole in the window and slight splintering of the glass. I took
               photos of the damage to the window. As I was taking photos of
               the damage, Caitlin C. Carboelo (09-11-97) came out of room 185
               and said she believes she heard someone shoot at the window.
               She said she thought it was either Monday evening (01-11-16) or
               Tuesday morning (01-12-16) between the hours of 0000 and 0200.
               She said she had her headphones on, but thought she heard a
               loud "Pop" sound. She did not open her door to look in the
               hallway. WSU Housing and Dining Maintenance workers arrived on
               scene to access the damage to the window. They determined the
               window was 33 inches x 33 inches and was 1/4 of an inch thick.
               They said the cost of the repair was approximately $315.00.
               After receiving the estimate, I knocked on a few more door on
               the floor to see if anyone else heard anything. Adriana R.
               Blanco (11-04-96) and Brienne L. Schmidt (04-25-97) live in
               room 183. They said they too heard a loud "Pop" type of noise
               late Monday evening (01-11-16). They said they also had their
               headphones on and did not open the door to look in the hallway.
               The occupant of room 182 said she did not hear anything so I
               did not identify her. Room 184 did not answer the door. As I
               was about to exit the hallway, Charlie M. Willms (12-12-97)
               exited room 190. I asked her if she knew anything about the
               hole in the window and she said she was outside the hall on
               Monday evening (01-11-16) at approximately 2300 hours. She said
               she heard a shooting noise which sounded to have been from a BB
               gun and from inside the hallway. She said she was fairly
               certain it was from a BB gun as she is familiar with the noise

               they make. She said she reported the incident to her Resident
               Advisor on Tuesday (01-12-16). I advised everyone I spoke with
               to contact their Resident Advisor if they learned any new
               information about the hole in the window. I exited the hall and
               began looking in the area outside the window to see if I could
               locate any shell casing or ammunition of any kind. I was able
               to locate a white nylon BB approximately 12 feet North East of
               the damaged window. I collected the BB as evidence and returned
               to the Police Department. Once back at the Department, I
               downloaded the photos into the "Files" section of the report
               and logged the BB into evidence. At this time I have no
               suspects or leads. I recommend the case be closed. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 15th day of January, 2016, in Pullman,

               bumper and lights WITNESS(ES): None NARRATIVE: On 01/15/16 at
               approximately 1108 hours I saw a call on my MDC for a non
               injury collision on SE Forest Way and SE Chinook Dr. I was in
               the area so I headed to the collision. Upon arriving on scene
               (corner of Forest Way at the northwest corner of the blue lot)
               I saw a Mitsubishi parked in the eastbound lane of travel with
               substantial damage to the front driver's side. I saw a Toyota
               parked around the corner on the side of the road in the
               west/south bound lane of travel. The Toyota had minimal damage
               to the front driver's side of the vehicle. I noticed debris
               from the Mitsubishi mainly in the eastbound lane of travel. I
               asked both drivers if they were injured and they said no. I
               took photos of the scene and asked the drivers what happened.
               Joelle Stephens (driver of Toyota) said she was traveling west
               and making the corner when she realized she was over the center
               line and collided with the Mitsubishi. Stephens said she was
               traveling between 15-20 MPH and was wearing her seatbelt. King
               Li (driver of Mitsubishi) said he was traveling north and
               turning the corner when the Toyota came over the center line
               and collided with his vehicle. Li said he was traveling between
               15-20 MPH and was wearing his seatbelt. The debris in the
               roadway was consistent with both subject's account of events. I
               facilitated an exchange of information and both vehicles were
               able to drive away from the scene. WSU Grounds crew assisted me
               with cleaning the roadway of the debris. I completed a SECTOR
               PTCR. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the
               laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 15th day of January, 2016 in Pullman,

               is the assistant hall director for Regents Hall. Piazza

               conduct their rounds in Regents Hall tonight at 2300 hrs and
               0100 hrs. Piazza was concerned for hall staff safety because a

               speak with them. I asked who lived in the room and they each
               said they did not. They told me they were just hanging out in a
               friends room. I asked if he allowed them to smoke marijuana in
               the room and they hesitated. I told them it was clear they had
               all been smoking marijuana and there was a strong odor coming
               from the room. They admitted to smoking marijuana in the room.
               I asked for their ID's. Mathews and Petcovic provided their
               ID's and Roberts gave his name and date of birth, which was
               confirmed through Dispatch. I told them the incident was going
               to be sent to student conduct only and told them to gather any
               marijuana and smoking devices in the room so they could dispose
               of them. They did so. Roberts produced a glass water bong and
               Mathews produced a clear plastic bag with a small amount of
               what I recognized as marijuana inside. I escorted them down to
               the dumpster where the marijuana and bong were disposed of.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 16 day of January, 2016, in
               Pullman, Washington. _______________________________________

               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Madaline M. Jones/052196 Fwd Chgs MIP
               Exhibiting 2. NARRATIVE: On 01/16/16 at about 0022 hrs I was
               driving westbound on Cougar Way passing WSU Parking Services
               when I noticed a female, later identified as Madaline M. Jones
               (052196), who was standing in front of parking services. She
               caught my attention because she was bent over and appeared like
               she was about to vomit in the bushes. I turned around and
               contacted Jones as she was passing the Lower Soccer Field. She
               had a male with her who was not identified and appeared sober.
               I asked why she was bent over in the bushes and Jones
               hesitated. I asked if she had too much to drink and she said "a
               little bit". She admitted to having 2 drinks earlier in the
               night. I could smell a strong odor of intoxicants on Jones'
               breath as she spoke to me. She swayed side to side as she stood
               and spoke with slurred speech. I asked if I could check her
               eyes to see how much she had to drink and she agreed. I
               administered a horizontal gaze nystagmus test and observed she
               had bloodshot and watery eyes, a lack of smooth pursuit, and a
               distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation. I asked
               Jones if she had ID and she did not. She provided me with her
               name and date of birth, which was confirmed through Dispatch. I
               asked where she lived and she said Tri-Cities and she was not a
               student at WSU. I asked if she would provide a PBT sample and
               she agreed. Jones provided a sample of .175 on alco-sensor FST
               #5493. I advised Jones I would be forwarding charges to the
               prosecutor's office for MIP Exhibiting. I asked where her home
               address was and she gave me her date of birth twice in a row.
               The third time I asked she told me she didn't know. When I
               asked why she didn't know what her home address was she said,
               "I'm just pretty drunk". Jones was able to answer a series of
               basic questions and did not appear unable to care for herself
               so she was released. Charges forwarded for MIP Exhibiting.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing

               01/16/16 at about 0145 hrs Dispatch advised of a report for
               hall staff in Stephenson South regarding the odor of marijuana
               coming from room 1027. I responded and confirmed there was a
               strong odor of burnt marijuana emitting from the room. I
               knocked on the door and a male, later identified as Bao V.N.
               Van (101296), answered. When the door opened I could smell the
               odor of marijuana became stronger. I asked Van why his room
               smelled like marijuana and he told me he did not know. I could
               see he had been playing a computer game in the room prior to my
               arrival. I asked if his roommate smoked and he told me he did
               not know and that his roommate went out for the night. I asked
               Van if he had his roommates phone number. He went to get his
               phone in the room and I asked if I could come in. He said that
               was fine. I entered the room and confirmed there was a strong
               odor of burnt marijuana in the room. I did not see any
               indication of marijuana consumption from Van though. I looked
               around the room briefly and did not see any signs of marijuana
               or paraphernalia visible. I explained to Van I would be sending
               the incident to student conduct. Once I returned to my patrol
               car I attempted to call Ventura but was unable to do so. I
               suspect Ventura smoked in the room prior to leaving for the
               evening as I did not see any signs Van was consuming marijuana.
