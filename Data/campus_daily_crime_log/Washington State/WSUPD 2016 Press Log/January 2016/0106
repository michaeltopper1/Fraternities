    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: KDS/326 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0046 SYNOPSIS: Report of a hit and run
               collision believed to be in the Commons Hall parking lot
               between Columbia Street and Washington Street. No suspects or
               leads at this time. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 010616 at approximately 1312 hours, I was
               dispatched to contact Alexa S. Anderson (042696) regarding a
               hit and run collision that occurred in December in a parking
               lot near Spokane Street. Upon contact, Anderson told me the
               following. Sometime between 121015 around 1300 and 121515
               around 1900 hours, her vehicle was damaged in the yellow 3
               parking lot between SE Washington Street and SE Columbia
               Street. She told me that when she parked her car on 121015 at
               1300 hours, she knew there was no damage to it. She drove her
               car on 121015 and 121115 between her residence and that parking
               lot. She stated over the weekend she didn't drive anywhere and
               she drove to and from that parking lot to her residence again
               on 121415 and 121515. She stated she noticed the damage when
               her car was parked at her residence in Pimlico Apartments. I
               asked her how she knew it wasn't damaged in her apartment
               complex and she stated she backs her car in to her space which
               is bordered by several concrete poles on one side and a flower
               bed on the other. I asked her to describe the damage to her
               vehicle and she told me the driver's side rear bumper was
               dented in and the rear quarter panel was damaged. I asked her
               to send me pictures via email and she told me she would. I
               asked her if she has any idea who may have caused the damage to
               her car and she didn't. Anderson told me she took her car to a
               autobody shop and was told the damage was at least $800. She
               told me she would email pictures of the damage and the estimate
               from the body shop when she received it. Case inactive pending
               further investigative leads. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 6th day of

               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0054 SYNOPSIS: Dispatched to
               report of a road rage incident in the parking lot near the
               Stephenson Complex. Contacted the reporting party and attempted
               contact with the other driver. No crime occurred, nothing
               further. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 01/06/16 at about 2213 hours I was dispatched to a cold road
               rage incident near the Stephenson Complex. The reporting party,
               Stephanie Parr, stated a vehicle leaving the parking lot
               stopped and the driver became irate and called her obscene
               names. Parr requested phone contact about the incident. I
               called Parr and talked to her about the incident. She said as
               she was pulling into the parking lot of the Stephenson Complex
               she was passing another vehicle coming out of the parking lot.
               The vehicle stopped, honked, and rolled down their window. The
               male driver of the vehicle was irate and began to call her
               names. Parr said the driver called her a "cunt" and said she
               was a bad driver. Parr said her vehicle was very close to the
               curb at the time they passed and the other vehicle had several
               feet of room on the other side. Parr took down the license
               plate of the vehicle, AVV7012/WA. The licenses plate was in
               local records and the owner was as well. I attempted phone
               contact with the owner of the vehicle, Scott Lorberau, but the
               voicemail said the phone belonged to "Virginia". I did not
               leave a message. I was unable to find a local address in local
               or state records. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 7th day of
