               19, 2015 at about 1353 hours I was dispatched to a hit and run
               collision that occurred on Stadium Way at Martin Stadium. The
               vehicles kept driving on Stadium Way. Joo followed the Chrysler
               to a parking lot near the Education Addition Building. He then
               parked down near Dana Hall because he did not have a parking
               permit for the lot where the Chrysler was parked. When Joo
               returned to the Chrysler there was no driver at the vehicle. I
               responded to the Education Addition Building parking lot where
               Joo was waiting for me. He said that he made a right turn from
               Cougar Way onto Stadium Way. Joo said he had a green light. As
               he made the right turn the front bumper on the driver's side
               made contact with the rear driver's side wheel of the Chrysler.
               Joo thought the Chrysler was traveling south on Stadium Way and
               may have run the red light. There are no traffic cameras at
               this intersection. The Chrysler is registered to Mingshen Li
               (05/11/92). I called and left a messaage for Li on January 19,
               2016 at about 1511 hours. The investigation continues. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of

               but it is unknown what caused the damage. There were too many
               scrapes on the underside of the sign to tell if a recent strike

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0299 SYNOPSIS: Report of a suspicious
               encounter between a male and female outside of the Student Rec
               Center. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 01/19/16 at approximately 1514 hours I was dispatched to a
               cold suspicious call where the reporting party, Alyssa N.
               Gonzales 03/01/97, was requesting phone contact. I called
               Gonzales who stated on December 10th, 2015 at approximately
               2130 hours she was walking home from the Student Rec Center
               when she felt as if someone was following her. Gonzales turned
               around and saw a male behind her. Gonzales said the male caught
               up to her and tapped her on the shoulder. Gonzales stopped
               walking and the male asked if she knew where a building on
               campus was. Gonzales did not know the building the male was
               asking about and the male pushed Gonzales on the shoulder
               saying something to the effect of, "what do you mean you don't
               know." Gonzales became scared and ran away westbound on North
               Fairway. Near the intersection of North Fairway and North
               Fairway Lane, Gonzales turned around and saw the male had not
               followed her. Gonzales said she did not know the male and had
               never seen him before. Gonzales described the male as a white
               male, 6'00", wearing black sweatpants, and a hoodie sweatshirt.
               Gonzales did not remember any other details about the male. I
               asked Gonzales about the push. Gonzales said she did not know
               if the male was trying to be playful or not but she did not
               believe he was trying to hurt her. I asked Gonzales if she was
               hurt by the push and she said no. Gonzales stated she just did
               not feel safe and wanted it documented. Gonzales also asked if
               we could do some extra patrols in the area at night. I told
               Gonzales I would pass on the information to the other Officers.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0302 SYNOPSIS: Vehicle versus pedestrian
               collision at the intersection of Stadium Way and Ferdinand's
               Lane. Pedestrian was transported to PRH via ambulance. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 01/19/16 at
               approximately 1657 hours, Ofc. Welter and I responded to a
               vehicle versus pedestrian collision at the intersection of
               Stadium Way and Ferdinand's Lane. Upon arrival I found traffic
               to be stopped and people huddled around Mary M. Chevalier
               05/07/49 who was laying on the ground in the middle of the
               street. I ran up to Chevalier who was being attended to by
               several people. Chevalier said she was hit by a car in the
               crosswalk and her left leg was hurt. The car, WA/AUM4364 a Gray
               2004 Saab sedan was still in the middle of the intersection
               where the collision occurred. I asked Chevalier if I could feel
               her leg for protruding bones and she said I could. I felt not
               protrusions and asked Chevalier if she could move her leg.
               Chevalier said her leg hurt to much to move. Ofc. Welter and I
               lifted Chevalier and carried her to the sidewalk. Once on the
               sidewalk we had Chevalier sit down. I repositioned the patrol
               cars so traffic could open back up. About this time Medics
               arrived and started to work on Chevalier. Once medics had
               Chevalier in the back of the ambulance I interviewed her as
               Ofc. Welter interviewed the driver of the Saab, Anderw C. Flint
               04/24/90. Chevalier said she was walking through the crosswalk
               on Stadium Way heading eastbound. Chevalier said there was a
               male in front of her who hit the crosswalk signal button just
               prior to them entering the crosswalk. Chevalier said she saw
               the Saab on Ferdinand's Lane try and take a left turn onto
               southbound Stadium Way as she was in the crosswalk. Chevalier
               stated she was unable to get away from the Saab and it hit her
               in the left leg which knocked her down to the ground. Chevalier
               stated the front bumper is what hit her. Chevalier said she
               thought the driver saw her too late but could not stop in time.
               I asked Chevalier if the driver had said anything to her and
               Chevalier said the driver was very apologetic and said he could
               not see her in the crosswalk. I asked Chevalier if there was
               anybody that she would like me to contact for her. Chevalier
               asked if I would contact her neighbor David L. Coon 06/15/42. I
               told Chevalier that I would let him know what was going on. I
               gave Chevalier my business card and her case number and let the
               medics resume their evaluation of her. Medics later transported
               Chevalier to PRH for evaluation. I breifly spoke with Flint who
               stated he was trying to turn left onto southbound Stadium Way

               from Ferdinand's Lane. Flint stated he never saw Chevalier
               before he already turning. Flint said he did not see the
               crosswalk signal warning lights flashing. At the time of the
               collision it was raining heavily and dark. Ofc. Welter provided
               Flint with his case number. I recommended that Flint contact
               his insurance company about the collision. I called Coon per
               Chevalier's request and notified him of Chevalier's situation.
               Coon said Chevalier has been his neighbor since the 80's and
               she is a single woman. Coon said he regularly checks up on
               Chevalier and would check up on her at the Hospital. See Ofc.
               Welter's supplement for his interview with Flint. END OF

               while leaving the emergency department at Pullman Regional
               Hospital I heard a female, later identified as Alstacia L
               Bennett (10/24/95) yelling from my left. I turned to look and
               Bennett was yelling for me to stop a male, later identified as
               Brian M Askham (06/26/95), who was walking to the west. I
               yelled for Askham to stop, which he did, and asked him what was
               going on. At this point Bennett told me Askham would not give
               her the keys to the vehicle which they shared. Askham then
               explained he and Bennett, who are married, were having a verbal
               argument and he wanted to walk up to Wal-Mart to cool off
               before returning. Around this point I advised Whitcom of the
               situation and Pullman PD officers were advised and responded.
               Prior to their arrival I continued speaking with Bennett and
               asked for his identification, which he provided along with
               Bennett's. I asked why he had her identification as well and
               was told she did not have her purse with her. At this point
               Askham also handed me the keys to the vehicle, which I gave to
               Bennett whom I told could go and wait for Pullman Officers in
               the vehicle. A short time later Ofc Breshears and Sgt Dornes
               arrived and I briefed them on what I had learned. Breshears and
               Dornes then went to speak with Bennett and Askham at which
               point I cleared. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,

               Warned/Student Poss. of Marijuana NARRATIVE: On 01-19-16 at
               approximately 2153 hours I was on patrol with WSUPD Intern Nick
               Jones in the area of Observation Dr, located at 2140 SE
               Observation Dr. As I drove towards the end of Observation Dr.
               there was a white, Chevrolet Cobalt (WA Lic. AXB1748) parked in
               the turn around with the engine running. I parked my patrol
               vehicle behind the Chevrolet and got out because the vehicle
               was blocking the turn around. I did not activate my emergency
               lights. I walked up to the driver side of the vehicle, while
               Intern Jones walked to the passenger side. The female rolled
               down the driver side window of the vehicle, she was later
               identified as Niaylah S. King (DOB 07-18-97). I asked King if
               they were just enjoying the view, and she said yeah. King told
               me her and her passenger were just hanging out. Intern Jones
               told me the passenger had a baggie of marijuana in between his
               legs. The male passenger was later identified as Jesse S.
               Maiwald (DOB 05-06-97). I asked Maiwald what he had over there,
               and he replied "weed". I told King and Maiwald I was audio and
               video recording. I asked King and Maiwald if they were both
               smoking in the car, and King replied "no, we were just hanging
               out". I asked if they were about to smoke, and King said no. I
               could see a glass bong next to King's feet. I asked her what
               the bong was doing there. She picked up the bong and told me
               they have not smoked out of it tonight. There were ice cubes in
               the bong, and it did not appear as if they had began smoking
               out of it, but it had burnt marijuana residue inside of it. I
               asked if either of them were of the age of 21, and they both
               said no. I asked if King or Maiwald had a medical marijuana
               card, and they both said no. I asked Maiwald if he had a pound
               of marijuana, and he said "no, I have like under a half an
               ounce probably". I asked Maiwald if I may see everything he
               had. Maiwald picked up a sandwich sized ziploc baggie from his
               lap which contained what appeared to be fresh marijuana based
               on my training and experience. I asked him if all the marijuana

               belonged to him, and he said "yeah". I asked him if I may
               please have it, and he said "yeah here you go". Maiwald handed
               me the baggie containing fresh marijuana. Ofc. Whitman arrived
               on scene as backup officer. I told King I was going to take the
               bong as well because it had marijuana residue in it, she handed
               me the bong. Maiwald told me that the bong is mostly used for
               tobacco. I asked them if that was marijuana residue on the
               side, and they both said yeah it was. I told them I know they
               said they were not going to smoke up there, but that I did not
               believe them. I told King if they had been smoking marijuana in
               their vehicle she could have got a DUI. King told me she was
               aware of that. I told both King and Maiwald they would be sent
               to WSU Student Conduct, and they told me they understood. I
               told Maiwald I would be forwarding charges on him for
               possession of marijuana to the Whitman County Prosecuting
               Attorney's Office, and he said he understood. Both King and
               Maiwald were polite and cooperative during my encounter with
