    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Olmstead/339 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0105 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched to a
               report of harassment. The subject was warned to have no further
               contact with the complainant. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 01-10-2016 at about 1444 hrs I
               was dispatched to a report of harassment at the Chinook
               Apartments #D22, located at 710 SE Chinook Drive. I contacted
               the complainant, Sinea M. Moss (DOB 12-27-1990), on the
               telephone. Moss is the apartment coordinator for the Chinook
               Apartments. Moss provided me with the following background
               information: Moss is friends with an individual identified as
               Matthew D. Scofield (DOB 02-03-1992). Scofield has been
               involved in a dating relationship with another female, who was
               identified as Katrina L. Cassens (DOB 03-17-1994). On 01-03-
               2016 Scofield and Cassens were involved in a domestic dispute,
               and Cassens was subsequently arrested for assault. For more
               information, see related case 16-P00041. After the domestic
               dispute, Scofield's relationship with Cassens was strained, and
               he began spending much more time with Moss. Cassens was upset
               because her relationship with Scofield was ending, and he was
               now seeing Moss. Moss told me Cassens is taking medication for
               mental health problems, has a history of domestic violence, and
               has threatened to make false claims about people, including
               Scofield. Moss said last week Cassens contacted her supervisor
               at WSU Housing and tried to get her in trouble. Cassens told
               Moss's supervisor that Scofield was living in Moss's apartment
               in violation of her housing contract and was keeping a firearm
               in the residence. Moss said both of these accusations were
               untrue. For more information, see related case 16-W0029. Moss
               said on 01-10-2016 between 1400 hrs and 1430 hrs she was at the
               Student Recreation Center and was approached by Cassens.
               Cassens told Moss that she heard Moss did not want her and
               Scofield to be together. Moss replied and told Cassens that she
               had no intention of breaking up their relationship and told
               Cassens, "I just don't want you near me". Cassens then asked
               Moss if she had anything else to say, and Moss told Cassens she
               did not appreciate Cassens notifying her work supervisor that
               Scofield was living in her apartment. Moss said Cassens walked
               away, and she did not see her again. Moss said Cassens has not
               threatened her and only tried to contact her on Facebook one
               time several weeks ago. Moss said she has blocked Cassens from
               her Facebook page. Moss requested that I warn Cassens to have
               no further contact with her. While I was speaking with Moss on
               the telephone, I could here someone arguing in the background.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
               Moss told me Scofield was at her apartment right now and was
               arguing with Cassens on the telephone. I told Moss to instruct
               Scofield to hang up on Cassens so he could speak with me, which
               he did. I spoke with Scofield on the telephone and asked him
               what was going on. Scofield told me he was in possession of a
               "carb cap" that belonged to Cassens, and she wanted it back.
               Scofield told me Cassens had his "dab nail" and also a french
               press coffee pot that belonged to him. Scofield explained that
               a carb cap and dab nail were marijuana smoking accessories.
               Scofield told me he did not want to have any further contact
               with Cassens and did not feel safe going to her residence to
               exchange their property. I told Scofield that I would assist
               with the situation and would contact him at Moss's apartment. I
               explained to Scofield that I would take the carb cap and return
               it to Cassens. After I concluded my conversation with Scofield,
               Dispatch advised that Cassens had called requesting police
               assistance with obtaining her carb cap from Scofield. I
               contacted Cassens on the telephone and explained the situation
               to her. Cassens agreed with my offer to assist with exchanging
               their property but told me the dab nail belonged to her.
               Cassens said she could show me her credit card history to prove
               she had purchased the dab nail. I told Cassens I would contact
               her at her residence later. At about 1626 hrs I contacted
               Scofield and Moss at Moss's apartment, 710 SE Chinook Drive
               #D22. I told Scofield that Cassens claimed the dab nail
               belonged to her. Scofield said he did not care anymore and
               wanted the argument to end. Scofield told me Cassens could keep
               the dab nail and the french press coffee pot. Scofield said he
               had blocked Cassens from his cellular telephone, email account,
               and Facebook page. I suggested to Scofield that it would be in
               his best interest to not have any further contact with Cassens.
               Scofield said he had no intention of contacting Cassens again.
               Scofield gave me the carb cap and told me I could return it to
               Cassens. I told Scofield and Moss to contact the police
               department immediately if they had any further problems with
               Cassens. I explained to both of them the procedures for
               obtaining a court order and suggested they pursue a court order
               if the problems with Cassens continued. I cleared the scene. At
               about 1703 hrs I contacted Cassens at her apartment, 880 NE
               Providence Court #N301, and returned the carb cap. I told
               Cassens she could keep the dab nail and french press coffee
               pot. I instructed Cassens to have no further contact with
               Scofield and Moss. Cassens said she wanted the relationship
               with Scofield to be over and told me she would not contact
               either of them again. I cleared the scene. I reviewed the facts
               in this investigation and determined no criminal offense had
               been committed, and no additional police assistance was needed
               or requested. No further action at this time. Olmstead/339 I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this __10__ day of __January____, 2016, in

               student throwing away some of his roommates items. The victim
               requested only a warning be issued. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Huy V. Tran/120697 Warned Theft 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 01/10/16 at about 2120 hrs Dispatch advised of a report from
               a parent regarding their son's property being thrown out by a
               roommate. I contacted the complainant, Tiffany N. Ziegelmann
               (100468), who told me her son, Nicholas M. Ziegelmann (081597),
               returned to his dorm room earlier in the day. His new roommate
               moved in earlier in the day. When Nicholas returned he found a
               bunch of his property was missing, and he found several small
               items of his on his new roommate's side of the room. Nicholas
               recovered 6 garbage bags full of his belongings from the
               dumpster. Some of the items recovered included a flash drive,
               several computer cables, some medication, and numerous papers.
               Tiffany indicated they thought it may just be a cultural issue
               and they did not necessarily want charges against the new
               roommate, Huy V. Tran (120697). I contacted Nicholas at his
               room and he told me the same information his mother gave me. He
               was not sure initially if he wanted charges or not and asked if
               he could call his mother. I provided him with my business card
               and told him to contact me after he spoke to his mother. I said
               I would attempt to contact Tran, who was staying at a hotel
               with his parents for the week. Nicholas had an e-mail from Tran
               which indicated his parents were the ones who went through
               Nicholas' stuff and that Tran knew some things may have gotten
               thrown away that shouldn't have. I had Nicholas forward the e-
               mail to me. It has been added to the case. I attempted to
               locate a phone number for Tran in ZZUSIS but was unable to find
               a local number. Not having any other way to locate Tran I
               called Nicholas and informed him I would likely not be able to
               make contact with Tran at that time. I told him I would send an
               e-mail to Tran. Nicholas said that was find and told me he did
               not wish to have any charges forwarded. He only wished to have
               Tran warned not to go through his stuff or let his parents go
               through his stuff again. I sent an e-mail to Tran informing him
               not to go through or let his parents go through Nicholas'
               belongings again. I indicated it appeared to be a
               misunderstanding but if something similar happened again they
               could be charged with theft. The e-mail to Tran was added to
               the case file. I contacted Hall staff about the incident and
               informed them they may want to follow up with Tran and Nicholas
               the following day or two to make sure the issue is completely

               Warned/Student Poss. of Marijuana NARRATIVE: On 01-10-16 at
               approximately 2132 hours I was dispatched to the report of the
               odor of marijuana emitting from Perham Hall #124, located at
               1624 NE Cougar Way. I arrived on scene. The hall director, Nhi
               P. Tran (DOB 07-16-88), and a few Resident Advisor's (RA) met
               me in the first floor elevator lobby. Tran and the RA's said
               the odor of marijuana coming from the room was very strong, and
               now most of the floor smelled like marijuana. They told me
               several residents advised them the odor was coming from #124 as
               well. Tran said you could now smell the odor of fragrances
               coming from the room. I went to room #124, and I could smell
               the strong odor of marijuana emitting from the crack in the
               door. I knocked on the door, and a female later identified as
               Kaitlynn A. Chisum (DOB 05-09-96) partially opened the door. I
               asked Chisum if she knew why I was there, and she said no. I
               asked her how much marijuana was in the room, and she said "uh
               none". I told Chisum she was already going to be sent to WSU
               Student Conduct, and lying to me was not going to help her
               case. I told her to gather up the marijuana and bring it to me.
               I asked Chisum who else was in the room, and she told me her
               friend, who was later identified as Hayley K. Clement (DOB 08-
               07-97). Chisum invited me inside of her room. I asked both of
               them if they were over the age of 21, and they both said no. I
               asked if either of them had a medical marijuana card, and
               Chisum told me she did. However, Chisum's medical marijuana
               card was out of California state. I asked them to please gather
               up the marijuana. Clement picked up a backpack on the floor and
               unzipped it. She removed a large ziploc baggie containing a
               glass jar with fresh marijuana and brought it over to me.
               Clement told me the backpack belonged to her, as well as all of
               the marijuana. Both Chisum and Clement admitted to smoking
               marijuana earlier in the room. I asked them what they were
               using to smoke with, and they showed me a small glass pipe. The
               pipe had burnt marijuana residue inside, and Chisum told me the
               pipe belonged to her. I told Clement and Chisum they would both
               be referred to WSU Student Conduct, and they told me they

               understood. Clement walked outside with me to a nearby dumpster
               and disposed of the marijuana and the pipe. I cleared the
               scene. No further action. My Vievu camera was activated, and
               the video was later downloaded into the permanent digital
               evidence folder. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury

               is true and correct. Dated this 11th day of January, 2016, in

               marijuana coming from room 719 Stephenson north. The subjects
               were contacted by hall staff before my arrival and were gone by
               the time I arrived on scene. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 01/10/16 at about 2328 hrs
               Dispatch advised hall staff at Stephenson North were reporting
               the odor of marijuana coming from room 719. I noticed in the
               CAD comments it indicated the RED detected the odor of
               marijuana from the room when the door was opened, indicating
               they already contacted the subjects. Upon my arrival I
               contacted the complainant, Jenna L. Doolittle (070988), who
               told me she was called by hall staff regarding the odor of
               marijuana. She said initially she did not detect the odor of
               marijuana coming from the room (719) so she knocked to contact
               the residents. When the door opened she could smell a strong
               odor of marijuana coming from the room. She told me that was
               when she decided to call and report the incident. According to
               Doolittle the resident and one female exited the room before my
               arrival. There was possibly a third subject still in the room.
               I went to the room and could not smell the odor of marijuana
               initially when I smelled the crack of the door on the door
               handle side. I then noticed there was a foam draft tape
               installed between the door and the frame, preventing any odor
               from escaping on that side. When I smelled the hinge side of
               the door I could smell the odor of burnt marijuana emitting
               from the room. I knocked on the door several times with no
               response. The light in the room appeared to be off so I advised
               Doolittle I would document the incident. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 11 day of January, 2016, in Pullman,
