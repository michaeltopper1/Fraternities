               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0181 SYNOPSIS: Responded to a non-injury
               collision between a WSU Facilities vehicle and a student's
               vehicle. Both parties contacted and report taken. Forward to
               WSU Risk Management. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 011316 at approximately 0959 hours, I was
               dispatched to a report of a two vehicle non-injury collision in
               the area of the Holland parking structure. Upon arrival, I
               contacted Craig L. Roberts and Jackson E. Smith. I asked
               Roberts what happened and he told me the following. He stated
               he was driving a university owned 2003 Chevrolet pickup and was
               stopped behind a vehicle who was stopped at the parking booth.
               The booth attendant advised that driver the lot was full and
               they needed to back up. Roberts told me he began backing up his
               pickup to allow the vehicle in front of his to get turned
               around when he backed into Smith's Subaru. Smith told me the
               same story. I checked Smith's vehicle and noticed an
               approximate 3 inch cut through his bumper near the passenger
               side headlight. I took a picture of the damage to his vehicle
               and provided him with the case number and how to get in contact
               with WSU Risk Management. I estimated the damage to his car at
               approximately $800.00. I checked the Chevrolet pickup Roberts
               was driving and didn't notice any damage. Roberts told me there
               was no new damage to the pickup. I warned Roberts for improper
               backing and cleared the call. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               13th day of January, 2016, in Pullman, Washington.

               room 1121 in Rogers Hall. I responded and met with hall staff
               who had detected the odor at the room and not beyond it. I
               knocked on the door and heard something being being sprayed, I
               assumed a masking agent. Bradford C. McGinnis (061596) answered
               the door and appeared ashen. The odor of marijuana was stronger
               with the door open. I asked McGinnis if he knew why I was there
               and he said no. I told him to try 1 time and he guessed that it
               had to do with the odor of marijuana. It was evident he had
               been smoking in the room. I had him retrieve all contraband. He
               could only locate his glass bong. He could not find the baggy
               the marijuana had been in. I informed him of the housing policy
               that the bong could not stay in the building. He disposed of
               it. I provided hall staff with the case number and cleared.

               NARRATIVE: On 01/13/16 around 1813 hrs I was dispatched to a
               report of a two car non injury collision on Stadium Way near
               Troy Lane. Whitcom went on to tell me one of the drivers, later
               identified as Daniel Iparraguirre (01/23/77), was at the WSU
               Police Department and reported the collision had occurred
               approximately 10 minutes prior. Upon my arrival I spoke with
               Iparraguirre and was told the following. Iparraguirre explained
               he had been traveling South on Stadium Way near Troy Lane when
               his vehicle (Wa. V683WSU) was rear ended by another vehicle. I
               asked if he had spoken with and exchanged information with the
               other driver, whom he had identified as female, and was told he
               had spoken with her but had not exchanged information. We
               walked over to his vehicle and I could see a small scrape which
               I estimated to be around $20.00. As I was getting ready to
               photograph the damage to his vehicle Whitcom advised me the
               other driver, later identified as Lydia G Guenther (06/22/96),
               was in the Pullman Police Department Lobby. I asked them to ask
               her drive to the WSU Police Department and while I awaited her
               arrival I completed photographing the damage to Iparraguirre's
               vehicle and provided him with my business card and case number
               for reference. A short time later Guenther arrived and after a
               brief conversation told me her vehicle (Wa. AXB1481) was parked
               in the Bustad Parking lot. We all went to look at her vehicle
               and upon our arrival I could not see any immediate indications
               of damage. Upon closer inspection I did see where the inside of
               her license plate bracket appeared to have scraped the bumper
               at some point. I noted this damage and photographed it before
               collecting her drivers license, registration, and proof of
               insurance, as I had previously with Iparraguirre. I scanned the
               information and provided both parties with an exchange of
               information before also providing Guenther with my business
               card and case number. I explained the options they both had and
               asked if they had any questions. Having none I cleared a short
               time later and returned to the WSU Police Department where I
               downloaded the photos taken and completed the necessary
               paperwork before clearing the call. Nothing further. I certify

               approximately 1852 hours I was dispatched to a drugs call at
               Gannon Hall room 533. While en route dispatch stated that I had
               responded to 533 on 01/08/16. I looked up the case (16-W0078)
               where I responded to room 533 and nobody answered. The room
               smelled strongly of marijuana. Upon arrival I knocked on the
               door of room 533 and Cody Ray Haggerton 10/17/96 answered. When
               Haggerton opened the door the odor of burnt marijuana
               intensified. I told Haggerton why I was called to his room and
               explained his options. Haggerton decided to collect his illegal
               items and destroy them. Haggerton grabbed two metal grinders
               and a glass bong. Haggerton stated he had smoked all the
               marijuana he had. We walked to the dumpster where Haggerton
               destroyed his illegal items. I explained the WSU policies and
               Washington Laws regarding marijuana. I also explained the
               student conduct process to Haggerton. I asked Haggerton if he
               had any questions and he said no. I told Haggerton that he was
               free to go and I cleared. END OF REPORT I certify and declare

               and found 2 RA's, the RED Ross McClure, and 2 subjects in the

               confronted by the RA's and both admitted to the RA's they were
               smoking marijuana. I asked if they had any marijuana left.
               Campos Cruz took a glass pipe out of her sweatshirt and said
               that was all they had. It appeared there was burned residue in
               the bowl. I asked how old they were Campos Cruz said she was 19
               and Lopez said she was 18. I asked if either of them had a
               medical marijuana card, they both said they did not. I
               explained they were both under 21 and did not possession a
               medical marijuana card so it was illegal for them to possesses
               or consume marijuana. I explained I was giving them a warning,
               and only forwarding my report to Student Conduct and not to the

               Ryerson/12-17-96 Forward to PA Minor Exhibiting & Student
               Conduct 2. NARRATIVE: On 01-14-16 at approximately 0012 hours,
               I was traveling west bound on Cougar Way when I observed a male
               on the north side sidewalk who was having a hard time walking.
               I could see markings on his forehead, but was unsure if he had
               been written on or what the marks were. I also observed the
               male stumbling side to side while he walked, and as I turned
               around to check on him, I watched him walk into the decorative
               bark near the Global Scholars Hall and begin to use the
               building for support as he walked. As I exited my patrol
               vehicle, I activated my body camera and observed the male sit
               down on a bench, bend over and begin spitting. I thought he was
               going to vomit. I walked up to the male and asked him how he
               was doing, and he said he was fine. As he spoke, I could smell
               a strong odor of intoxicants emitting from his breath. I could
               also see his face had blue paint splattered all over it. I
               asked him what was on his face and he said paint from a paint
               party. I could hear his speech was slurred and his movements
               were slow and deliberate. I also observed his eyes were
               bloodshot, watery, and appeared sleepy. I asked him how old he
               was and he stated 19. I told him it was obvious he had too
               much, and he stated he had, "a good amount". I asked him for
               his identification and he was identified as Jacob P. Ryerson by
               his WA Driver's License. I asked him where the pant party was
               and he stated Phi Kappa Phi. I noticed his pants appeared wet
               and asked him if he had wet himself and he said no. I asked him
               how much he had to drink to tonight and advised him he was
               being audio and visually recorded. He stated he had quite a bit
               and was just going home. When I asked him how much quite a bit
               was he stated about 8 or 9 beers. I asked him on a scale of 1
               to 10 with 10 being the most drunk he has ever been how drunk
               he thought he was and he stated a 6. I asked him a few
               questions to see if he was aware of the date and where he was
               and he was able to answer my questions. He told me he has just
               transferred to WSU from UA. I asked him if he knew he could not
               be under the age of 21 and intoxicated in public and he said
               yes. I asked him if he would be willing to take a PBT test and
               he said yes. Ofc. Westerman, who had arrived on scene while I
               was talking to Jacob, administered the PBT test. The PBT was in
               proper working order and a reading of .210 was observed at

               his information to the PA's office for Minor Exhibiting in a
               Public Place and it would be up to them as to whether or not he
               would be charged. He stated he understood. I also advised him I
               would send his information on to Student Conduct and he stated
               he understood. I advised him he was free to go home and he
