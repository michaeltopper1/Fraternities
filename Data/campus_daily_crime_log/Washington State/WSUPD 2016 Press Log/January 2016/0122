               noises and doors propped open in Kimborough Hall at 0500 hours
               when the janitors arrive to work. Request for Extra Patrol

               at approximately 0707 hours, I was dispatched to contact Kelly
               Jo Keggerreis regarding the janitors hearing suspicious noises
               coming from the tunnels below the performance stage in the
               concert hall of Kimbrough Hall. Upon arrival, I contacted Kelly
               Jo who told me the following. She stated at 0500 hours one of
               the janitors arrived to clean the building and noticed the
               north stairwell door to the exterior of the building was
               propped open with a cinder block and he heard noises coming
               from the basement tunnels below the stage. Kelly Jo stated the
               janitors checked the area and didn't find anyone, but she
               believes someone may be living in the tunnels because it has
               happened in the past. I advised her we could do some extra
               patrols in the building during the hours when the building is
               supposed to be closed. She thanked me and told me she would be
               available by cell phone if any of our officers contacted anyone
               in the building after hours. I emailed all our officers and
               contacted the Cougar Security Captain and asked her to advise
               our Cougar Security units when they go on foot patrols. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 22nd day of January, 2016, in Pullman,

               approximately 0818 hours Whitcom dispatched me to a traffic
               offense with the reporting party wanting contact. I called the
               reporting party, Chris Chapman, and asked what happened.
               Chapman explained that at approximately 0800 hours he was at
               the intersection of SE Idaho St and SE Columbia Ave preparing
               to cross the street. Chapman said a blue hatchback was
               traveling north at what he described as 35MPH. Chapman said the
               driver of the vehicle stopped at the intersection of Idaho and
               College Ave. The driver exited with his backpack and ran to
               class. Chapman said the female passenger climbed into the
               driver's seat. Chapman contacted the female and told her to
               tell the driver to "Slow the F down". Chapman provided a
               license plate for the vehicle, but it was not the correct
               plate. I spoke with Chapman about problem areas he has
               encounter and I told him we would do extra patrols to look for
               bad drivers. Nothing further. I certify and declare under

               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 01/22/16 at
               approximately 1315 hours I was dispatched to a hit and run
               collision in the blue lot off of Chinook Dr. I met the
               reporting party, Anne Hutton, and she showed me damage to the
               driver's side of her vehicle. Hutton parked her car in the
               middle tier (4 from top & bottom) on the north side towards the
               east end. Hutton said she parked her car at approximately 0845
               hours and when she came out at 1315 she noticed the damage. The
               damage consisted of dents/scratches to the driver's side front
               quarter panel and driver's door. The driver's mirror was folded
               back with a scratch on it. There were scratches to the driver's
               side rear quarter panel as well. On the driver's door I located
               what appeared to be tire marks consistent with a vehicle
               turning into the car and causing the damage with the tire as
               opposed to the vehicle. I found a piece of juniper bush on the
               door, which would indicate the vehicle had already parked, so
               it was backing up when it occurred. There was white
               scratches/scrapes to the rear driver's side quarter panel. I
               took photos of the damage. I provided Hutton with my business
               card and case number. I checked all the white vehicles parked
               in the blue lot, but did not find one with matching damage. No
               suspects at this time. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 23rd day of January,

               hours, I was dispatched to Steffen Center regarding an injured
               deer. Upon arrival, I saw a smaller doe laying down. I walked
               toward the doe and it stood up and began trotting away using
               three of its legs. After it slowed down, it began walking using
               its front right leg which was missing its foot. The deer didn't
               appear to be in any distress. After it stopped running, it
               walked over to some grass and began eating. I determined the
               animal would likely survive if left alive, and cleared. I
               contacted Lisa Shipley who reported the deer and advised her of
               the outcome. She thanked me and told me she would continue to
               monitor the deer's health and would call if she could see a
               noticeable decline. Nothing further. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of

               Suicidal 2. NARRATIVE: On 012215 at approximately 1531 hours,
               WSU Police and Pullman Fire Department were dispatched to a
               report of a suicidal subject in WSU Health and Wellness. Upon
               arrival, I contacted Anna M. McMurphy who was sitting in a
               hospital room. McMurphy told me the following. For the past
               three months or so, she has been having thoughts of wanting to
               kill herself. She told me in the recent past she tried to cut
               her wrists and both inner arms near the elbow joint. She stated
               she has thought about jumping in front of passing cars, off
               buildings and putting a hair drier in water and electrocuting
               herself. She told me that prior to her arrival at WSU Health
               and Wellness, she took 8 pills of Tylenol PM. I asked her why
               she took the pills and she told me she wants to die. I asked
               her if she took all the pills in her room and she told me she
               tried to take all 10, but her mom convinced her to spit the
               last two out. She stated she was starting to get drowsy. I
               asked her if she has been seeing any WSU Counselors and she
               told me she sees Dr. Sanders. I asked her if she is on
               depression medication and she told me she was prescribed some
               medication and it worked for approximately one month. She
               stated after that, she noticed a decline in its effectiveness
               and asked to get her medication switched. She told me they
               haven't figured out any solution yet. I asked her if she had a
               contract with Dr. Sanders and she told me she didn't. I asked
               her when the last time she saw Dr. Sanders and she stated two
               days prior. At that point, Pullman Medics arrived and began
               questioning McMurphy. I advised McMurphy she was being placed
               in protective custody. I explained that if she would be willing
               to go compliantly to the hospital, she would ride in the
               ambulance and she wouldn't be restrained. She told me she would
               do her best. I completed the protective custody paperwork and
               gave it to Sgt. Kuhrt. He followed her to the hospital and
               asked the ER doctor to complete the transfer of protective
               custody. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 22nd day of January,

               suspected it was a fraturnity pinning ceremony. The frat has
               been doing this for about 4 years. I gave them some advise on
               contacting the neighbors about using the area. The agreed that
               in the future they would make arrangements to be there. Officer
               Petlovany walked the area and there was no damage at that time.
               Since there are no signs stating No Trespassing there was no
               criminal or civil event. Nothing further............. I certify

               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Malachi L. King/090297 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 01/22/16 at about 2200 hrs Dispatch advised of a
               welfare check at Coman Hall. The report was from a male, later
               identified as Malachi L. King, who stated he was depressed and
               didn't want to hurt himself. I responded and contacted King
               outside Coman Hall. He told me he was just mad about life in
               general and wanted to punch a wall repeatedly. I asked if he
               wanted to go to the hospital and speak with someone and he said
               yes. I transported King to PRH so he could speak with a mental
               health professional. Once at the hospital King was
               uncooperative with hospital staff and did not want to change
               into a hospital gown. One of the nurses and I spoke with him
               for some time about what was going on in his life. He stated
               several times he was angry about things he had done and wanted
               to break things and punch something when he called initially.
               He told us he is a high school student and is staying with his
               girlfriend in Coman. He also spoke about some money issues he
               was having. He said he had no intentions of hurting himself. I
               told him it was clear he was having some issues and it would
               probably help him to speak with someone about it. He did not
               want to speak with a mental health professional about anything.
               He initially asked for treatment for an abrasion on his foot
               and some pain in his hand. At that point I had no reason to
               place an involuntary hold on King so I spoke with hospital
               staff about it and they agreed. I later received a call stating
               King was refusing any medical treatment. I returned to PRH and
               provided King with a courtesy transport back to Coman Hall.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 23 day of January, 2016, in

               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0357 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched
               to a report of an intoxicated person near Avery Hall. The
               subject was contacted, taken into protective custody, and
               transported to Pullman Regional Hospital. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 01-22-2016 at about
               2256 hrs I was dispatched to a report of an intoxicated person
               near Avery Hall, located at 655 NE Library Mall. Cougar
               Security personnel reported that a male had fallen on the
               ground and appeared to be intoxicated. Officer Whitman and I
               arrived on scene and contacted the intoxicated male, who was
               later identified as Joshua R. Marvin-Looney (DOB 02-28-1997).
               Marvin-Looney is a WSU Student and was 18 years old. Marvin-
               Looney was sitting on the ground in the landscaped area located
               on the north side of Avery Hall. Marvin-Looney was vomiting,
               appeared to be disoriented, and could not answer questions or
               speak clearly. I could detect the odor of alcohol originating
               from Marvin-Looney. Marvin-Looney could not stand up, appeared
               to lack coordination, and did not know where he was. Officer
               Whitman administered the PBT, and Marvin-Looney provided a
               breath sample of .265. I looked around the area and found a
               Fireball whiskey bottle on the ground near Marvin-Looney.
               Marvin-Looney also had three cans of Keystone Light beer in his
               pant pockets. Marvin-Looney said he did not want the beer cans
               and removed them from his pant pockets. The whiskey bottle and
               beer cans were discarded in a nearby trash can. I requested
               that Pullman Fire Department be dispatched to evaluate Marvin-
               Looney for alcohol detox. Pullman Fire Department personnel
               arrived on scene. The fire department personnel did not
               evaluate Marvin-Looney and advised that I could deal with him
               however I wanted. The fire department personnel stated that
               Marvin-Looney was a huge waste of resources and suggested that
               I arrest him for trespassing. After evaluating Marvin-Looney, I
               determined that he was incapacitated by alcohol and was in a
               public place. I told Marvin-Looney that he was in protective
               custody, and he would be transported to the hospital. The fire
               department personnel stated they would not transport Marvin-
               Looney in the ambulance and provided me with a blanket to wrap
               him in when I placed him into my patrol vehicle. Officer
               Whitman and I placed Marvin-Looney (handcuffed double-locked)
               into my patrol vehicle and noticed that he had urinated in his
               pants. I transported Marvin-Looney to the Pullman Regional
               Hospital. Once at the hospital, I noticed that Marvin-Looney
               had passed out in the back seat of my patrol vehicle. Officer

               Whitman and I struggled with removing Marvin-Looney from the
               back seat of my patrol vehicle and placed him into a
               wheelchair. Marvin-Looney was delivered to the emergency room,
               I completed the protective custody form, and he was admitted to
               the hospital. Officer Whitman and I cleared the scene. The
               protective custody form was downloaded into Spillman and
               attached to this case. My Vievu camera was activated during

               01/22/16 at approximately 2240 hours I was driving past Streit
               Hall when I noticed a male, later identified as Daniel Ka Wai
               Poon 08/27/97, on the ground in a slumped over seating position
               just inside the Streit entrance doors. There were two other
               males attempting to pick up Poon's limp body. I parked near by
               and walked up to the building and saw all three males in the
               elevator with elevator doors closing. I watched the floor
               indicator sign and noticed the elevator stopped on the 4th and
               6th floor. I took the stairs and walked the 4th floor finding
               nothing out of the ordinary. I went to the 6th floor and came
               to room 608 and found a set of keys in the lock of the door
               with the door shut. I could also hear voices coming from the
               room. I waited outside the room for a minute listening to what
               sounded like an intoxicated male telling someone else that he
               wanted to punch them. The non-intoxicated voice was telling the
               intoxicated voice not to punch him. I knocked on the door and
               Henry James Pappin 01/30/97 answered the door. I told Pappin,
               Poon, and the third (not identified) male what I had observed.
               I told Poon I needed to talk to him. Poon walked to the door
               and was very unsteady on his feet. I asked Poon a series of
               questions to determine his mental status. Poon was able to
               answer some questions correctly and others not. Poon was never
               able to correctly tell me what month it currently was. Poon was
               boarder line needing to go to the hospital for an alcohol detox
               however since he was in a private residence I had no legal
               right to take him. I asked the two other males if they would be
               willing to watch Poon for the night. Pappin said he would watch
               Poon to make sure he was ok. I told Poon that he needed to stay
               indoors for the remainder of the night otherwise he could be
               arrested for MIP. I left Poon in Pappin's care and cleared. END

               On 01/23/16 at about 0127 hours I was dispatched to a

               Boyd and I responded and talked to the RA's who had let the

               noticed he had blood on his hand and was being confrontational.
               I knocked on the door to room 608. The subject, later
               identified as Daniel K. W. Poon, answered the door. Officer
               Westerman and I had contacted Poon earlier in the night, see
               report 16-W0358. Officer Westerman had advised Poon to stay at
               his dorm for the remainder of the evening. Poon told me had
               only left to get water from the restroom. The RA's told me they
               had let him in the building and the people who dropped him off
               said he was at Nez Perce apartments. Poon's speech was slurred
               and repetitive. There was also the odor of alcohol coming from
               him. He repeated denied drinking alcohol. Poon had a small
               scrape on the back of his hand that had stopped bleeding. I

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0361 SYNOPSIS: Subject contacted for MIP
               Exhibiting. Charges forwarded to the prosecutor's office and
               student conduct. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Taylor
               J. Elliott/082496 Fwd Chgs MIP Exhibiting 2. NARRATIVE: On
               01/23/16 at about 0157 hrs I was driving eastbound on Campus
               St. near B St when I noticed a female, later identified as
               Taylor J. Elliott, who was crossing the street from near
               Community Hall toward Honors Hall. Elliott caught my attention
               because she appeared to be under 21 and was stumbling side to
               side as she walked. Just before reaching the sidewalk Elliott
               stopped and turned to look at my patrol car as I stopped to
               wait for her to finish crossing the street. She then turned and
               lifted her foot to step up on the sidewalk but started to lean
               backwards as she did so. She had to take a step backwards to
               regain her balance before continuing forward and up the
               sidewalk. She stumbled side to side as she started walking up
               the sidewalk toward McCrosky Hall. I contacted Elliott on the
               sidewalk across from Community Hall. I asked where she was
               going and she said home to Rogers Hall. I told her I was
               concerned with how much she had to drink and asked how much she
               had to drink. She said "too much". I asked how old she was and
               she first said, "under age". I asked again and she told me 19.
               As she spoke I could smell the odor of intoxicants on her
               breath. Elliott did not have any ID with her but provided her
               name and date of birth, which was confirmed through Dispatch. I
               asked Elliott if I could check her eyes to see how much she had
               to drink and she agreed. I administered a horizontal gaze
               nystagmus test on her and observed she had bloodshot and watery
               eyes, a lack of smooth pursuit, and a distinct and sustained
               nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes. Elliott was able
               to carry on a conversation and answer all my questions
               appropriately. I told her I would be forwarding charges to the
               prosecutor's office for MIP Exhibiting and she was released.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 23 day of January, 2016, in
               Pullman, Washington. _______________________________________

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0363 SYNOPSIS: Report of the odor of
               marijuana coming from room 363 McCroskey Hall. I responded and
               determined there was no odor of marijuana in room 363 McCroskey
               however there was a feint odor in the hallway outside the room.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               01/23/16 at about 0251 hrs Dispatch advised hall staff at
               McCroskey Hall was reporting the odor of marijuana coming from
               room 345. I responded and as I approached the room could smell
               a feint odor of marijuana in the hallway near the doorway. When
               I put my nose to the door I could smell an odor that smelled
               like burning incense and/or candle. I knocked on the door and
               contacted the residents, Jasmine A.M. Smith, Evelyn Bullington-
               Schneider, Meladie L. Hoff. I told them I received a complaint
               regarding the odor of marijuana coming from their room. They
               told me they did not have marijuana in the room and had not
               been smoking. They invited me in to look around if I wanted. I
               looked around the room and did not see any signs of marijuana
               usage in the room. I asked if they had been burning something
               in the room and they said they had two candles burning earlier
               in the night. They showed me the candles and I was able to
               confirm them as the source of the odor I was smelling. I did
               not smell any odor of marijuana inside the room. It is unknown
               at this time where the odor of marijuana in the hallway was
               coming from as it was too feint to locate a source for the
               odor. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 23 day of January,
               2016, in Pullman, Washington.

               and found intoxicated subject with cut finger. Ambulance

               Pullman Fire Department was dispatched to hemorrhage at Honor
               Hall. The reporting party said the subject was intoxicated and
               had blood on him. The subject was reported to be in the
               stairwell on the north side of the building. Officer Boyd and I
               responded and found the intoxicated male, later identified as
               Rigoberto A. Perez, in the stairwell. As we were coming up the
               stairs I found a cougar ID card. The photograph on the card
               match Perez. When Officer Boyd asked Perez his name Perez said
               it was "Leon". Perez continued to be evasive in his answers.
               Perez had the odor of intoxicants coming from him. His speech
               was slurred. He knew he was at Honors Hall but was evasive
               about where he lived. Perez finally said he lived in 33C. Perez
               had dried blood on his shorts, hands and leg. The only wound
               appeared to be the nail bed of a finger on his left hand. The
               blood around his finger was dried and his finger was not
               currently bleeding. We cancelled Pullman Ambulances response.
               RA's found his keys and vomit in the stairwell. We walked Perez
               to room 330C of Honors Hall. Perez's name was on the door. I
               was able to talk to one of Perez's roommates who lived in room
               B, his name was Hayden T. Arend. Arend agreed to help Perez.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 23rd day of January, 2016, in
