               DEPARTMENT ** COLLISION REPORT ** CASE #:16-W0236 SYNOPSIS: One
               vehicle non injury collision. Driver was going too fast and
               jumped the curb, damaging her wheel and deflating the tire.
               Photos taken. Non reportable. DRIVER 1: Lauren R. Stiger
               05/06/96 VEHICLE 1: Gray 2000 Chevy Suburban (WA AGA0676)
               INSURANCE: Unknown DAMAGE: $300 Damaged wheel and tire on front
               passenger's side NARRATIVE: On 01/16/16 at approximately 0950
               hours I was turning left onto SE Spokane St. from SE Campus St.
               I saw tire marks in the snow/slush/ice that led to the curb on
               the west side of the road and up onto the sidewalk. The tire
               tracks then continued back onto the roadway southbound. I had
               driven this route 3 previous times and on my first trip I
               noticed another set of tire tracks sliding into the curb. I was
               able to safely make the turn at a reasonable speed, as were
               many other cars on the roadway. I continued south on SE Spokane
               St. and saw a Chevy Suburban pulled over on the west side of
               the roadway with its flashers on. I contacted the driver,
               Lauren R. Stiger, and asked her if she hit the curb and she
               said she did. There were three other females with her
               (unidentified) and I asked if anyone was injured and they all
               responded that they weren't. Stiger told me she is calling AAA
               for a tow. I looked at the front passenger tire and noticed
               there was a chip out of the wheel and the tire was flat. I
               could not see if there was any damage beyond that. I noticed
               the tire were aggressive tires with ample tread, which I
               pointed out to Stiger and she agreed that they were new. I told
               Stiger that she was driving too fast when she made the corner.
               I took photos of the damage and asked Stiger if she had a spare
               tire. Stiger said she did, but she couldn't get the jack out.
               Stiger said her dad told her to call AAA. Since the vehicle was
               safely off the roadway, I cleared. I photographed the roadway
               and checked for damage to the curb and could not find any.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 16th day of January, 2016 in

               DWLS 2nd. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Gerardo C.
               Garduno/102196 Cite/Release DWLS 2nd 6Z0225615 2. NARRATIVE: On
               01/16/16 at about 2214 hrs I was driving eastbound on North
               Fairway Rd. when I noticed a vehicle, WA AXA3256, which was
               driving westbound on North Fairway Rd. the vehicle caught my
               attention because it appeared to be traveling faster than the
               posted 20 MPH speed limit. I activated my police traffic radar
               unit (vh4) which emitted a high pitched audio doppler tone that
               was steady in pitch. I observed a display on the radar unit of
               30 MPH which was consistent with my visual estimate of the
               vehicle's speed. The vehicle was the only moving vehicle in the
               radar field at the time of the readings. The calibration of the
               radar unit was checked both before and after the stop by the
               use of factory certified tuning forks. The radar unit was found
               to be in proper working order. I turned around and initiated a
               traffic stop on the vehicle, turning on my overhead lights. The
               vehicle stopped on North Fairway Rd. at Beasley Coliseum. I
               contacted the driver, Gerardo C. Garduno (102196), and told him
               the reason for the stop and the stop was being recorded. I
               asked for his driver's license, vehicle registration, and proof
               of insurance. He provided his driver's license and the vehicle
               insurance. A passenger, who was the owner of the vehicle, said
               he just bought the car and did not have a registration yet. He
               showed me the purchase paperwork. I returned to my patrol
               vehicle and ran Garduno on my MDC. His driver's return
               indicated he was DWLS 2nd degree. I asked Garduno to step out
               of the vehicle and asked if he knew his license was suspended.
               He said he did not. I told him it was and advised he was under
               arrest for DWLS 2nd degree. I placed him in handcuffs (double
               locked) and searched him incident to arrest. He was placed in
               the back of my patrol car while I completed a citation
               (#6Z0225615) for DWLS 2nd degree. I explained the citation to
               him, he received his copy, and was released. No one in the car
               was able to drive the vehicle so they called another friend who
               was able to drive. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 17 day of
               January, 2016, in Pullman, Washington.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0246 SYNOPSIS: Dispatch advised Resident
               Advisor's were requesting assistance on their nightly rounds in
               Regents Hall. Officer responded and provided assistance.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 01-16-
               16 at approximately 2303 hours I was dispatched to the report
               of a citizen assist at Regents Hall, located at 1580 NE Cougar
               Way. Dispatch advised the complainant, Michelle C. McKay (DOB
               04-17-96), is a Resident Advisor and was requesting assistance
               from an officer for their nightly rounds. I arrived on scene. I
               met McKay and Maddison A. Gostin (DOB 09-06-95), who is also a
               Resident Advisor, in the front lobby of Regents Hall. McKay and
               Gostin told me strange things have been happening in Regents
               Hall lately and that is why they requested I assist them with
               their rounds. I asked if they could explain those strange
               things to me. McKay told me RED (hall director) on duty, Acacia
               L. Kapusta (DOB 08-25-89), called one of the WSU
               Troubleshooters on the phone to come fix some doors in Regents
               Hall. McKay said the male that arrived and identified himself
               as the Troubleshooter was acting strange and did not have any
               tools or a radio with him. McKay said she thought this was
               suspicious. McKay said she later saw the male and he asked if
               she could let him into the basement, and she told him no. McKay
               said she did not know if he could have access to the basement.
               She did not believe he was really a Troubleshooter. McKay
               described the male as a tall, black college aged male wearing
               jeans and a hooded sweatshirt. McKay and Gotsin also mentioned
               an incident that occurred earlier in the week with a BB hole in
               one of the dorm windows (see related case #16-W0217). McKay
               asked if I would follow her and Gostin tonight on their rounds
               because they would feel safer. During the rounds they
               discovered a new BB hole in one of the windows on the fourth
               floor (see case 16-W0247 for full report). I later met the
               Assistant Hall Director, Katelynn M. Piazza (DOB 04-07-94).
               When McKay and Gostin described the male to her she knew
               exactly who he was and identified him as one of the
               Troubleshooters. I later spoke with Kapusta and I asked her
               which Troubleshooter she had called earlier. The name she told
               me matched the same one Piazza had mentioned earlier. No
               further action. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 17th day of January, 2016, in
               Pullman, Washington. _______________________________________

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0247 SYNOPSIS: Subjects reported a
               damaged exterior hallway window in Regents Hall. It appears it
               may have been caused from a bb pellet. Officer responded and
               there are no suspects or leads at this time. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 01-16-16 at
               approximately 2323 hours I was assisting Resident Advisor's
               Michelle C. McKay (DOB 04-17-96) and Maddison A. Gostin (DOB
               09-06-95) with their nightly rounds at Regents Hall, located at
               1580 NE Cougar Way. See case 16-W0246 for full report. During
               the rounds at about 2323 hours McKay and Gostin discovered a
               hole in the glass window on the fourth floor at the end of the
               hall near room #483. McKay and Gostin said they had checked
               that window at about 2130 hours on 01-16-16 when they did their
               last round, and the hole was not there. It was discovered
               around 2321 hours on 01-16-16. The window was located on the
               northeast side of Regents Hall, and the window was facing the
               backside of Northside Hall. The hole appeared to be caused by a
               BB pellet being shot through it. There were small pieces of
               glass scattered throughout the hallway. We talked to several
               people on the floor, but nobody had heard anything. McKay and
               Gostin told me about a similar case with the window on the
               first floor earlier in the week that was shot with a BB
               pellet(see case 16-W0217). The window was approximately 33
               inches x 33 inches and was 1/4 of an inch thick. Estimated
               value to repair the window is $315.00. I did not see a BB
               pellet anywhere in the hallway. I could not see any damage to
               Northside Hall. The hole was bigger on the inside of the
               window, so somebody shot the BB from outside into Regents Hall.
               Gostin is the Resident Advisor of the fourth floor, and she
               told me she would speak with her residents tomorrow morning to
               see if any of them heard the damage occur. No suspects or leads
               at this time. My Vievu camera was activated, and the video was
               later downloaded into the permanent digital evidence folder. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 17th day of January, 2016, in Pullman,

               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 01-17-16 at approximately 0158
               hours I was dispatched to a report of malicious mischief in the
               grey 1 lot near the Stephenson Towers, located at 1285 SE
               Stadium Way. Dispatch advised the complainant, Ross A. McClure
               (DOB 12-30-86), thought someone had just vandalized a parked
               vehicle and then drove off. Dispatch advised the male was last
               seen approximately 5 minutes ago headed towards Stadium Way. He
               was described as a heavier set white male driving a blue, Ford
               Expedition with tan trim. I arrived on scene. I contacted
               McClure standing near a red, 2002 Jeep Liberty (WA Lic.
               AUR7399). The Jeep had it's front and rear passenger side
               windows broken out and there was glass laying on the floor.
               Ross told me he was coming out of the south entrance of Rogers
               Hall, when he heard a loud "boom" coming from the grey 1 lot.
               He said he heard a car peel out, and saw a navy bluish, Ford
               Expedition with tan trim traveling quickly past Rogers Hall and
               towards Stadium Way. He said he drove over to the parking lot
               to see if any of the vehicles had been damaged and that is when
               he saw the Jeep with the windows smashed out. McClure told me
               he saw the driver and the vehicle leaving the scene, but he did
               not see the male actually break the windows. I asked him if
               there was anyone else in the Ford, and he said he only saw the
               driver, but that the back windows were tinted. He described the
               driver as a white male with a round face. I asked him if the
               driver had any facial hair, and he said he was unsure. When I
               asked McClure how old the male was, he replied college aged.
               McClure said the Ford was probably at least a 2005 or newer. I
               asked if he saw any distinguishing marks on the Ford, and he
               said no. I asked about the license plate, and McClure said he
               could see it was a Washington plate, but that was it. I took
               photographs of the damaged Jeep, and the photos were later
               uploaded into Spillman. The Jeep had a parking permit that
               returned to a Joseph R. Tadesse (DOB 05-27-97). I called
               Tadesse on the phone and told him about his vehicle, and asked
               if he would come outside. Tadesse and his friend met me a out

               stolen. Tadesse said everything appeared to be there, and it
               did not look like anyone had even entered his vehicle. He told
               me the only thing of value inside his vehicle was his
               checkbook, but that had not been taken and there were no checks
               missing. I asked if he knew who may have done this to his
               vehicle, and he said no. I described the suspect vehicle to
               Tadesse and his friend, but they both said that vehicle does
               not sound familiar to them. I told Tadesse to call me if he
               discovers anything had been stolen from his vehicle. I provided
               him with my business card. I cleared the scene. No suspects or
               leads at this time. My Vievu camera was activated, and the
               video was later downloaded into the permanent digital evidence
               folder. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 17th day of January, 2016, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer

               female at Regents Hall. Subject evaluated by medics and left
               with a friend. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 01-17-16 at approximately 0227 hours, I responded
               to a sick person call at Regents Hall. The RP stated the female
               was intoxicated and having a hard time standing. I arrived and
               found them in the restroom. The female was intoxicated and had
               the odor of intoxicants emitting from her breath. Shortly after
               I arrived, she began puking in the toilet. Her friends were
               helping her and I remained until Pullman PFD medics arrived.
               They began evaluating her and determined she did not need to go
               to the hospital. They asked the friends if they would watch her
               and they stated they would. Medics stated I could clear and I
               did. They assisted the friends in getting the female to their
               room. I did not identify the female or the friends. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.
