    Narrative: RVWD: AE/330 OFC:MTK/336 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #:16-W0365 SYNOPSIS: Loose cows on Animal
               Science Road. They were coaxed into returning to their field.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               01/23/16 at approximately 1110 hours I was dispatched to the
               report of cows loose on Animal Science Rd. I arrived on scene
               and found 3 dairy cows standing in front of the barn. I managed
               to get one into a nearby field. The other two began walking
               down Animal Science Rd. towards Terreview. I drove down to
               Terreview and parked by the road and activated my emergency
               lights to warn cars, but in no way was I intending to detain
               the cows or make them feel as if they were not free to go. I
               began to walk towards the cows to turn them up the road when I
               noticed the rest of the herd walking down a field towards us. I
               noticed a double panel gate to the field was laying down. With
               the speed of a cheetah I up-righted one of the panels and held
               it in place with a nearby 2 x 4. At this point one of the cows
               walked over the other panel into the field. The lone cow left
               walked towards Terreview. I managed to get in front of the cow
               and turn it around and then it joined the other 4 in the field.
               I propped up the other panel and then realized the field I
               corralled them into opened up into the golf course. A student
               arrived on scene about this time and went up to the barn with
               her friend to find the other cows (apparently there was more)
               and to find the open gate. I knew it was futile to chase the
               cows so I gave up and went back to the barn to assist. I found
               the student and her friend trying to get 5 other cows from a
               neighboring field into the barn area. As I began to assist them
               I saw my original crew walking back up to the barn. I re-
               directed my efforts and opened a gate and low and behold they
               went right in. Now back to the other 5. We were able to wrangle
               2 of them into the appropriate area, but we were having the
               hardest time getting the last 3 to enter the gate. Cow 991
               would stand at the gate, but not enter because of the puddle of
               water that looked like a large pond to her. Luckily
               reinforcements arrived in the form of 2 four legged Border
               Collies. It should be noted that the dogs still had a difficult
               time getting the cows in. I was able to manhandle 991 into the
               gate. No injures to report, but I had very dirty boots and
               uniform. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 23rd day of January, 2016, in Pullman,

    Narrative: RVWD:MTK/336 OFC: JAK/333 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0368 SYNOPSIS: A citizen called Whitcom
               stating he heard a female yelling at one or more children
               within an apartment, then take one or more children to her car
               and "Storm" out of the parking lot. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 01-23-16, Alonzo M. Grogan
               (11-22-88) called Whitcom stating he heard a female yelling at
               one of more children in apartment 106B in the Outlook
               Apartments. He said the female then took one or more children
               from the apartment to a vehicle, described only as a white
               Hyundai sedan, and then "Storm" out of the parking lot. Grogan
               told Whitcom he believed there may still be a child in the
               apartment. I began driving toward the Outlook apartments and
               was dispatched to a Burglary alarm at the Pufferbelly Depot.
               Sgt. Kuhrt and I responded to the Pufferbelly Depot and found
               no one inside the Depot and all of the exterior doors locked.
               We cleared the scene and responded back to the Outlook
               apartments. Upon our arrival, we located the vehicle in
               question (WA/AMY2738). A woman was in the driver's seat and 4
               children were in the car with her. I identified myself to the
               woman and explained why we were there. I identified the woman
               by her WADL as Jessica A. Cahill (02-06-84). I asked Cahill to
               tell me what was going on. She said she was running late to
               meet someone to deliver a dog kennel and her oldest son, Dustin
               T. Kirk (12-20-03) was not listening to her or cooperating. She
               said Kirk was messing around and would not come to the car. She
               said she finally had to practically pull him out of the door.
               She explained Kirk has ADD and is OCD. She said he is a
               "Difficult" child. I explained I understood how difficult
               parenting can be at times, but she needed to do her best to
               keep her voice down and to keep things under control. I also
               asked her not to "Storm" out of parking lots when driving. I
               explained just because she was running late did not excuse her
               from using due care and caution while operating a motor
               vehicle. There was no Domestic Dispute therefore it is
               unfounded. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 23rd day of January,
               2016, in Pullman, Washington.

               01-95 Warned/Student Poss. of Marijuana NARRATIVE: On 01-23-16
               at approximately 2121 hours I was dispatched to the report of
               the odor of marijuana emitting from Regents Hall #384, located
               at 1580 NE Cougar Way. I arrived on scene. The hall director,
               Jordan L. Keithley (DOB 05-12-86), and a few Resident Advisor's
               (RA) met me near the hallway. Keithley told me the odor of
               marijuana was coming from #384, and there was at least one
               resident inside. I went to room #384, and I could smell the
               strong odor of marijuana emitting from the crack in the door. I
               knocked on the door several times before I heard a female voice
               answer. I told them it was was the police department and to
               come to the door. I heard a female voice say she just got out
               of shower. I waited a couple minutes before a female, later
               identified as Dominique S. Thomas McCullum (DOB 12-24-95),
               answered the door. I asked Thomas McCullum if she knew why I
               was there, and she said no. I told Thomas McCullum I was audio
               and video recording. I asked her how much marijuana was in the
               room, and she replied "none". I asked her why her room smelled
               like marijuana, and she said "I can't imagine why". I could see
               another female in the room, she was later identified as Mia E.
               Alvarez (DOB 05-01-95). I told Thomas McCullum I knew there was
               marijuana in the room and I wanted her to go get it. I asked to
               see Thomas McCullum and Alvarez's identification, and they both
               provided it to me. I asked if either of them were over the age
               of 21, and they both said no. I asked if either of them had a
               medical marijuana card, and Alvarez said no, but Thomas
               McCullum did not reply. I asked Thomas McCullum and Alvarez if
               they had been smoking in the room, and Thomas McCullum said she
               had some candles lit in her room. I asked her if they were
               marijuana candles, and she said no. I asked where they had been
               smoking, and Thomas McCullum said she had not smoked marijuana
               today, only cigarettes. I told Thomas McCullum to stop lying to
               me because my report would be going to WSU Student Conduct. She
               told me she was familiar with the process. I kept asking about
               the marijuana, but she continued to deny it. I again asked
               about the marijuana, and I asked what they had been smoking out

               of. I asked if they were smoking out of a pipe, and Alvarez
               said "no we were smoking out of an apple". I again asked when
               they had smoked marijuana, and Thomas McCullum said they had
               both smoked a couple hours ago outside. I asked for them to go
               grab the apple and any other illegal drugs in the room. Alvarez
               brought me an apple with holes in it containing burnt marijuana
               residue, along with a small ziploc baggie containing fresh
               marijuana. Alvarez told me the marijuana belonged to her. I
               told both Thomas McCullum and Alvarez they would be referred to
               WSU Student Conduct. They both followed me outside to a nearby
               dumpster and the apple and marijuana were thrown away. I
               cleared the scene. My Vievu camera was activated, and the video
               was later downloaded into the permanent digital evidence
               folder. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under

               approximately 0220 hours I was on patrol on B St. and Campus
               St. when I observed three subjects walking on the pathway
               behind McCroskey Hall. A female subject appeared to be holding
               onto a male, and appeared to need assistance walking. I drove
               my patrol vehicle over to Veterans Way. I watched the male and
               female walk down the sidewalk, and they were having trouble
               walking in a straight path. It appeared the male had stumbled a
               few feet to his left, but I am unsure if it was because of the
               female leaning against him. There was another female subject
               walking with them. All three of them appeared to be under the
               age of 21. WSUPD Intern Murphy and I exited my patrol vehicle.
               I walked behind the subjects and asked if I may talk with them,
               and they all stopped. I asked both the females and male who had
               the arm around the female how much they had to drink tonight.
               The male told me he did not have anything to drink. I asked the
               female, later identified as Sarai Solorio Mendoza (DOB 05-04-
               97), if she was the only one to drink, and she told me she did
               not have any alcohol. I told Solorio Mendoza and the male they
               could barely walk in a straight line down the sidewalk, and
               Solorio Mendoza replied "no, he's my boyfriend". I told her
               that had nothing to do with what I asked. Solorio Mendoza had
               bloodshot and watery eyes and I could smell the strong odor of
               intoxicants coming from her breath. Solorio Mendoza told me I
               was just inferring that she had alcohol to drink tonight. I
               told her she did not need to lie to me, I could smell the
               intoxicants coming from her breath, and she replied "I have gum
               in my mouth". I told them they were being audio and video
               recorded. I asked Solorio Mendoza how much she had to drink
               tonight, and she said "not much". I asked her what not much
               was, and she said "I don't know". I told Solorio Mendoza first
               she told me she had nothing to drink, to not much to drink, to
               she is unsure of how much she drank. When I asked Solorio
               Mendoza how old she was she told me 19 years old. She later
               told me she was 18 years old. I asked her where her driver's
               license was out of, and she replied "I don't know" and then
               immediately said "it's Washington". She talked with fast and

               slurred speech. I asked if she could stand up without her
               boyfriend holding onto her, and she said yes. The male let go
               of Solorio Mendoza. Solorio Mendoza swayed in a circular motion
               as she stood there. I asked her if I may check her eyes and she
               said "sure I guess". Her eyes were equal in size and tracked
               equally. I did not observe any resting nystagmus. I observed
               lack of smooth pursuit, distinct and sustained nystagmus at
               maximum deviation, and nystagmus onset prior to 45 degrees in
               both eyes. I checked for vertical nystagmus, and it was present
               in both eyes as well. I asked her if she would be willing to
               take a voluntary PBT, and she said "I don't think so". I told
               Solorio Mendoza I could tell she has had a lot to drink based
               on her eyes, odor of intoxicants coming from her breath, and
               her difficulty walking down the sidewalk. I told Solorio
               Mendoza I would be forwarding charges on her to the Whitman
               County Prosecuting Attorney's Office for minor exhibiting the
               effects of having consumed alcohol in a public place. I asked
               her if she understood, and she replied "based on what?". She
               told me that she passed all of my tests. I asked what she meant
               by passing all of my tests, and she replied that she did all of
               my tests. Solorio Mendoza continued to tell me that chewing gum
               causes the tests to go up, and I told her well she never took
               the PBT. I told her if she wanted to spit out the gum and take
               the PBT she was welcome to. She told me the gum would still
               effect the breathalyzer. I told Solorio Mendoza she would also
               be sent to WSU Student Conduct. Solorio Mendoza's boyfriend
               told me he would be watching her tonight. Intern Murphy and I
               cleared the scene. No further action. My Vievu camera was
               activated, and the video was later downloaded into the
               permanent digital evidence folder. I certify and declare under

               about 0244 hrs Dispatch advised hall staff at Northside Hall
               were reporting the odor of marijuana coming from room 309A. I
               responded and upon my arrival found hall staff in the common
               area of the suite speaking with the occupants of 309A. I could
               smell the odor of burnt marijuana coming from the room. I told
               the occupants it was obvious they had been smoking marijuana
               based on the smell. I told them my plan was to send the
               incident to student conduct only and advised them to gather up
               all their illegal items, drugs/alcohol, and we would go destroy
               them. I asked them who lived in the room and the two male
               subjects, later identified as Dane E. Slaybaugh and Riley L.
               Ellison, said they lived in the room. The third occupant was
               later identified as Emily R. Conroy. I asked for their ID's.
               Ellison and Slaybaugh provided their driver's licenses and
               Conroy provided her cougar card and date of birth. Ellison
               retrieved a small prescription bottle that was approximately
               half full of what I recognized to be marijuana. They took the
               water bong which was laying on the floor as well as several
               bags of garbage and walked to the dumpster where the items were
               destroyed. I warned them about smoking marijuana in the room
               and told them I would be sending my report to student conduct.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 24 day of January, 2016, in
               Pullman, Washington. _______________________________________

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0382 SYNOPSIS: Subject was pulled over
               for not using his turn signal near Stadium Way and Lower Dr.
               The driver was cited and released for DWLS 3rd. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Jordan M. Dascalo/08-06-94 Cited and
               Released DWLS 3rd 6Z0246985 2. NARRATIVE: On 01-24-16 at
               approximately 0315 hours I was on patrol in the area of the
               Cougar Way and Stadium Way intersection. When I approached the
               intersection, I observed a white, 2002 Lexus 470 (CA Lic.
               SPRKLI) stopped at the red light in the left hand turn lane
               with no turn signal activated. Once the light turned green the
               Lexus traveled through the intersection completing the left
               hand turn onto Stadium Way to the inside lane. The Lexus then
               changed lanes into the outside lane, again not using their turn
               signal. I activated my emergency lights, and I stopped the
               vehicle for the above described violation on Stadium Way near
               Lower Dr. I activated my Vievu camera and contacted the driver
               of the vehicle, who was later identified as Jordan M. Dascalo
               (DOB 08-06-94) by his California driver's license. I told
               Dascalo I was recording, and I pulled him over because he did
               not use his turn signal. He told me he was trying to turn off
               the dome light in his vehicle in his car, and then he saw a
               vehicle pull behind him and the light turn green. Dascalo said
               he was just trying to get out of the way in a hurry. I asked
               him for his driver's license, vehicle registration, and proof
               of insurance. He provided me with current vehicle registration,
               valid proof of insurance, and his California driver's license.
               I went back to my patrol vehicle, and I asked Dispatch to run
               Dascalo for a records check. Dispatch advised Dascalo's
               driver's license was suspended in the third degree in
               Washington for failure to appear on an unpaid traffic ticket. I
               went back and contacted Dascalo, and I explained to him I would
               be issuing him a criminal citation for driving while license
               suspended. I issued Dascalo Sector Criminal Citation #6Z0246985
               for driving while license suspended in the third degree. I
               provided Dascalo with his copy of the citation and I explained
               the instructions on the citation. Dascalo told me he received a
               speeding ticket in Cheney, WA but his mom told him that she
               paid it for him. I told Dascalo to contact the courts in Cheney
               first thing on Monday. I told Dascalo he needed to have someone
               else come pick him up or drive his car for him with a valid
               driver's license. I told him if he drove away he was at risk of
               getting arrested again for DWLS, he told me he understood. I
               cleared the scene. No further action. My Vievu camera was
