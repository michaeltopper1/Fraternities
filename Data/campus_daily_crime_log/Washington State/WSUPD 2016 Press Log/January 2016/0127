               hours I was driving southbound on Stadium Way approaching
               Grimes Way when I noticed the car in front of me was displaying
               expired tabs as of 10/2015. I initiated a traffic stop at
               Stadium Way and the CUE parking garage. I contacted the driver,
               Shiloh Heta Filipo 02/03/94, identified myself, informed Filipo
               that I was recording, and told her about her tabs. Filipo
               stated she thought her mother had renewed the tabs. Filipo
               provided me with her driver's license only. She was unable to
               find her proof of insurance or vehicle registration. I returned
               to my patrol car and ran Filipo through dispatch. Dispatch
               confirmed the vehicle was expired and Filipo's return showed
               she was suspended in the 3rd degree through Washington. I
               filled out a Sector citation for DWLS 3rd degree and failure to
               renew tabs over two months. I returned to Filipo and asked if
               she would talk to me over by my patrol car. Filipo exited her
               car and I asked her if she knew that her license was suspended.
               Filipo said she did not know it was. I asked her if she had
               paid a speeding ticket she received in Grant County, WA. Filipo
               said she had forgot to pay that ticket. I issued Filipo a
               Sector citation for DWLS 3rd degree and an NOI for failure to
               renew tabs over two months. I explained the citations to Filipo
               and provided her with her copies. I asked if Filipo's passenger
               had a good driver's license but the passenger, Meritta Grace
               Leilua 05/29/96, only had an ID card. I parked Filipo's car for
               her and told her that she would need to call a friend to get
               her car home. Filipo said she understood and I cleared. END OF
