    Narrative: RVWD: Boyd/335 OFC: DBT/321 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0386 SYNOPSIS: Subjects reported the
               odor of marijuana coming from a room in Perham Hall. Male in
               the room was under the age of 21 and had admitted to smoking
               marijuana outside earlier. He will referred to WSU Student
               Conduct. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Adam N.
               Faasee/03-17-97 Warned/Student Poss. of Marijuana 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 01-24-16 at approximately 2206 hours I was dispatched to the
               report of the odor of marijuana emitting from room #632 in
               Perham Hall, located at 1624 NE Cougar Way. Ofc. Boyd and I
               arrived on scene. The Hall Director, Jordan L. Keithley (DOB
               05-12-86), and a few Resident Advisor's (RA) were in the
               hallway as well. They were all standing outside of room #632.
               The door was open to room #632, I asked them if they had
               already contacted the individual inside of the room, and they
               told me yes for alcohol. The male, later identified as Adam N.
               Faasee (DOB 03-17-97), gave me permission to enter his room. I
               told Faasee I was audio and video recording. I could not smell
               the odor of marijuana inside of the room. Faasee admitted to
               smoking marijuana outside of his room earlier, but denied
               having smoked inside of the room. When I asked if he had any
               marijuana, drug paraphernalia, or any other illegal drugs in
               the room, he told me no. I asked Faasee what he had been using
               to smoke the marijuana with, and he told me it was rolled in
               paper. I asked him how much marijuana he had, and he told me
               not very much. I told Faasee it is illegal to smoke marijuana
               in a public place, and he told me he did not know that. He is
               also under the age of 21. I told him he would be referred to
               WSU Student Conduct. He was polite and cooperative throughout
               my encounter with him. Ofc. Boyd and I cleared the scene. No
               further action. My Vievu camera was activated, and the video
               was later downloaded into the permanent digital evidence
               folder. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 24th day of January, 2016, in Pullman,

               Dispatch advised hall staff in Regents Hall were reporting the
               odor of marijuana coming from room 133. I responded and
               confirmed the odor of burnt marijuana was coming from room 133.
               I knocked on the door several times but no one answered the
               door and it did not sound like anyone was in the room. As I was
               waiting for hall staff to provide information for who lived in
               the room one of the residents, Aranza Rivera-Gaxiola, called
               the resident who lives across the hall and requested to speak
               with me. She said she was told the police were at her room and
               wanted to know what was going on. I told her I was called for
               the odor of marijuana coming from her room. Rivera-Gaxiola told
               me she had not been home for a while and did not know anything
               about it. I asked if her roommate smoked and she did not answer
               but said she hadn't seen her roommate in a while. I asked where
               she was and Rivera-Gaxiola told me she was off campus. I told
               her I would be sending the incident to student conduct. Nothing

               DEPARTMENT CASE #:16-W0389 SYNOPSIS: Two residents contacted
               and warned for smoking marijuana in their room. Referred to
               student conduct. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.Cortez
               Montiel, Elpidio Student Conduct Poss Marijuana 2.Figueroa
               Mendiola, Alan Student Conduct Poss Marijuana NARRATIVE: On 01-
               25-16 I was dispatched to the odor of marijuana coming from
               Gannon #418. I responded to the area and when I was just inside
               the hallway door I would smell the odor of burnt marijuana. I
               spoke to the R/P RED Dustin Cooper. He stated that the R/A on
               duty smelt the odor coming from 418 and called him. I checked
               the doors around 418 but there was no odor coming from them.
               When I smelt 418 there was a very strong odor coming from that
               room. I knocked on the door and residents Alan Figueroa
               Mendiola and Elpidio Cortez Montiel answered the door. I asked
               if they knew why I was there and they said they didn't know. I
               told them it was for the odor of marijuana coming from the
               room. There was no response from the two. I asked If anyone had
               been smoking marijuana in the room and both admitted they were.
               I asked if there was any more in the room and they said there
               was. Elpidio Cortez Montiel went to a desk and retrieved some
               rolling papers and a zip lock baggie containing a small amount
               of GVM (green vegetable material). We spoke about the legal
               problems with smoking marijuana since neither on is over 21
               years of age. Both admitted it was wrong to be smoking in their
               room. I told the two there would be no criminal charge, but I
               was going to refer them to student conduct. Alan Figueroa
               Mendiola and I went to the dumpster outside the building and he
               threw the marijuana away. Nothing further................. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
