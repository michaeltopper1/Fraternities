               hours I was dispatched to an others call. I contacted Lacey
               McNarir, WSU Health and Wellness by telephone. McNair was
               reporting a piece of missing property from the WSU Health and
               Wellness inventory. WSU Health and Wellness is unable to locate
               a Dell Inspiron XPS M1530 laptop, SN: CNOD50F7016684E0AFT, WSU

               $1484.43. It is unknown when the item was last seen and where.
               McNair is new to the department and told me that several
               computers like this one had gone out to WSU Surplus. I called
               WSU Surplus and spoke with Ron Redman. He has no record of this
               item being processed through WSU Surplus. Per the WSU Business
               Policy and Procedures Manual (BPPM) the missing inventory item
               must be reported to the police and WSU Internal Auditor. There
               are no witnesses, suspects or leads. No further investigation.

               protective custody and transported to PRH for evaluation.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Pringle, Ryan R
               (092396) Transported to PRH Protective Custody 2. NARRATIVE: On
               01/25/16 around 1741 hrs Ofc Olmstead and I were dispatched to
               a report of a possible suicidal subject in room 216 of either
               Streit or Perham Hall. As we were en route we were told the
               subject, later identified as Ryan R Pringle (09/23/96), had
               threatened to take some medication before hanging himself in
               his closet. Olmstead and I arrived a short time later and after
               speaking with Hall Staff determined Pringle lives in room 216
               of Streit hall and went to the room. No lights were visible
               through the peep hole in the door and we received no answer
               upon knocking on the door. Olmstead announced our presence
               before keying into the room which we found vacant. We secured
               the room and as we were leaving it was decided that Olmstead
               would try and contact the reporting party, while I attempted to
               contact Pringle. As we exited the building and I got back into
               my car I heard Pringle was currently in class in room 452 of
               Kimbrough Hall. We were also told he was scheduled to get out
               of class at 1800 hrs. We both went to that location and upon
               reaching room 452 found the class still in session. We entered
               and asked if Pringle was present. He identified himself and as
               we left the room he asked if his father had contacted us. We
               continued outside of the building where Olmstead contacted the
               reporting party, Donald E Pringle (07/22/72), while I spoke
               with Ryan. I asked Ryan what was going on and he made reference
               to Olmstead and I receiving a phone call from his father,
               Donald. I asked him what his father would have told us and he
               went on to explain the following. Ryan explained he has been
               having a difficult time recently. He told me he is currently
               taking 17 credits and is not doing well. In addition to his
               classes he had a relationship end approximately a month ago and
               he has no friends. During this point in the conversation Ryan
               was looking down at the ground with his shoulders hunched
               forward before speaking again. He went on to explain he had
               told his father he intended to kill himself tonight. I asked
               him what his plan was and he told me he was going to combine
               some NyQuil with Ibuprofen before hanging himself using his
               belt in his closet. Ryan explained he had been thinking about
               it and had tested the cross bar in the closet to see if it
               would hold his weight, and after determining it would, decided
               on that course of action. We continued to speak and I asked him

               if he had considered how this would impact other people in his
               life. He told me he had and he just wanted to do something for
               him. We continued to speak on this before I told him I would
               like to take him to speak with someone at the hospital. He
               agreed and I placed him in the rear of my patrol car, after
               searching him, before speaking with Olmstead. Olmstead told me
               he had just gotten off the phone with Donald. He went on to
               explain what Ryan had just told me about his plan and
               difficulties with classes. At this point it was decided I would
               transport Ryan to Pullman Regional Hospital for further
               evaluation while Olmstead contact Donald and explain what was
               going on. A short time later I transported Ryan to Pullman
               Regional Hospital where I signed the protective custody form
               which was also signed by medical staff. I briefed the medical
               staff on what I had learned from Ryan and Olmstead before
               making a copy of the form before speaking with Ryan again. We
               spoke for a short period of time before I told him I would
               leave my business card with his belongings and if he was having
               any difficulties and simply needed to talk to someone to give
               me a call. Ryan thanked me and I cleared a short time later.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 25th day of January, 2016, in

               arrived on scene, but nobody came to the door. The odor of
               marijuana was emitting from the room. Resident's of the room
               will be referred to WSU Student Conduct. NAME/DOB ACTION

               Conduct Poss. of Marijuana NARRATIVE: On 01-25-16 at
               approximately 2256 hours I was dispatched to the report of the
               odor of marijuana emitting from Stimson Hall #304, located at
               1355 E. College Mall. Ofc. Boyd and I arrived on scene. The
               hall director, Jordan L. Keithley (DOB 05-12-86), and a
               Resident Advisor (RA) met us in the hallway. I could smell the
               odor of marijuana in most of the hallway. They told me they
               knew the odor was coming from #304 because one of the neighbors
               that lives in #306 complained about the odor because his room
               shares a bathroom with #304. Keithley told me the neighbor in
               #306 was willing to speak with me and let me inside of his room
               if I wanted to smell the odor. I knocked on room #304 several
               times, but there was no answer. I did not hear anyone inside of
               the room. Ofc. Boyd told me he could smell the odor of
               marijuana emitting from the crack in the door. I went to room
               #306 and knocked on the door. A male voice coming from the
               inside told me to come inside. I opened up the door and went
               inside. The male was later identified as Vincent A. Daniels
               (DOB 04-28-97). Daniels told me he does not smoke, and he hates
               the odor of marijuana. He told me the smell of marijuana is so
               bad inside of the bathroom, that he does not use it. I asked
               him if he cared if I went inside of the bathroom, and he
               replied "go for it". I walked inside of the bathroom and I
               could smell the very strong odor of marijuana inside. The RA
               provided me with the individuals names that live in room #304:
               Jacob E. Brady (DOB 10-15-96) and Adrian C. Jenkins (DOB 03-09-
               97). Both Brady and Jenkins will be referred to WSU Student
               Conduct because of the odor of marijuana emitting from their
               room. No further action. My Vievu camera was activated, and the
               video was later downloaded into the permanent digital evidence
               folder. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 26th day of January, 2016, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer
