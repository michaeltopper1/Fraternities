    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Edwards/330 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0029 SYNOPSIS: RP called with questions
               about a visitor of a campus resident who may have a gun. It was
               determined that the gun is at PPD being held for safekeeping.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 01-05-
               16 at about 0833 hours I was dispatched to the report of a
               weapons offense. The RP, Megan Autry, is the supervisor of WSU
               Apartment Coordinators and had just talked to Katrina L.
               Cassens who was concerned that a visitor of an apartment
               coordinator may have a handgun in their possession in campus
               housing. As this call was being dispatched to me, PPD Officer
               McNannay sent me an IM through Spillman stating that the
               subject's handgun was currently being held for safekeeping at
               PPD. McNannay also advised that two days ago PPD responded to a
               domestic dispute between Cassens and her boyfriend, Matthew D.
               Scofield. Cassens was arrested for Assault 4th degree DV and
               Scofield voluntarily gave his gun to PPD for safekeeping (see
               case 16-P00041 for more information about the DV). I called
               Autry to ask her what was going on. She told me that she just
               got off the phone with Cassens who told her she was concerned
               about Scofield staying with the apartment coordinator for
               Chinook Village Apartments, Shinea Moss. Autry said that
               Cassens was concerned because she knows Scofield has a gun and
               that he is "volatile". Autry said that her main concern was the
               gun and that she realized there were other issues/violations
               going on that she would deal with from an employment/housing
               standpoint. She said Cassens provided her with a lot of
               information but wanted to pass the information about the gun
               along. I ended my call with Autry and called Cassens. She did
               not answer so I left a voicemail message for her. She called
               back within a few minutes. I asked her to explain what was
               going on. She went into great detail about the domestic
               violence situation she had with Scofield a couple days ago. She
               explained that she was unhappy about the way the investigation
               was handled and that she felt "violated" by the 4 male officers
               that responded. I tried several times to explain to Cassens if
               she was unhappy about the investigation she could contact PPD.
               I asked her twice about the gun she mentioned Scofield having.
               She said that she hid Scofield's gun during their argument but
               that the officer's retrieved it and gave it back to Scofield
               "even though he has untreated PTSD". She said that Scofield is
               "unstable" and that he has been staying with Shinea Moss, the
               apartment coordinator for Chinook Village Apartments. She told
               me she is concerned for the resident's in the apartment complex

               because of her assessment that Scofield is unstable. Cassens
               told me that I needed to "tell everybody about his untreated
               PTSD" so he would not be allowed to have the gun and stay on
               campus. I told Cassens that I would not do that and informed
               her that the handgun Scofield had during the domestic dispute
               was in safekeeping at PPD. She said "oh, that's good" and went
               on to say again that I needed to let everybody know how
               "unstable" he is so he can't have the gun back. Cassens was not
               able to provide any more detail or examples of why Scofield
               might be a danger. I explained to Cassens that even if Scofield
               had his handgun it would only be a university violation, not
               criminal. I also explained to her how she could file a
               complaint at PPD if she was not happy about the way the
               investigation went. After ending my call with Cassens I tried
               calling Scofield. He did not answer. I left him a voicemail
               asking him to return my call. I changed this case from a
               weapons offense to a civil issue based on the information I had
               gathered. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this ____ day of _____________, 2016, in
               Pullman, Washington. _______________________________________

               marijuana in Stephenson South room 931. Charges forwarded to
               Whitman County Prosecutro on resident for possession of
               marijuana. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Kasandra S.
               Numair/06-05-97 Forward Charges Poss. of Marijuana 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 01-05-16 at about 1148 hours I was dispatched to
               the report of drugs at Stephenson South room 931. Whitcom
               advised that the Hall Director had confirmed the odor of
               marijuana emitting from room 931 and was waiting on scene for
               contact. I arrived on scene and met the Hall Director, Dustin
               Cooper. Cooper advised that he was notified of the odor of
               marijuana by the custodian who was cleaning the hall. Cooper
               said when he went up to the room he could smell the odor of
               marijuana emitting from room 931. Cooper said he was 100% sure
               that the odor was emitting from room 931 and that the odor he
               was smelling was marijuana. We both went to room 931. I could
               smell the faint odor of burning marijuana in the hallway. I
               went to room 931 and put my nose to the crack of the door. The
               odor of burnt marijuana was very strong at the crack of the
               door. I knocked on the door and could hear shuffling around but
               nobody answered. I waited a moment and knocked again. I heard
               more shuffling but no answer. I knocked a third time and
               announced that it was the police department and to open the
               door. I heard more shuffling then a female answered the door.
               The female was identified by her Washington State Driver's
               License as Kasandra S. Numair. She was the only person in the
               room. When the door was open there was an overwhelming odor of
               marijuana emitting from the room, so much so that I believed
               Numair had been smoking marijuana when I first knocked on her
               door. I asked Numair if she knew why I was there. She said she
               thought it might have to do with her contact "last night". I
               told her no and told her I was there for the odor of marijuana
               coming out of her room. Numair denied having any marijuana in
               the room. I asked her about her drug use and she said that she
               smoked when she got up this morning around 8 am but that she
               did that outside and not in her room. I noticed Numair was
               wearing only a bathrobe and it appeared as if she had just
               recently got out of bed. I told her I did not believe her
               because of the overwhelming odor that was emitting from her
               room. I told her the odor would not be this strong if she
               smoked marijuana that many hours ago. She said she did not have
               anything. I asked Numair if she would give me permission to
               search her room and she said no. I told Numair that I knew she

               was contacted on the 3rd for the same issue and asked her if
               she could collect anything illegal she was in possession of.
               She looked around but said she did not have anything "except
               maybe a pipe". As I spoke to Numair I noticed her eyes were
               droopy and bloodshot which I know from my training and
               experience are both side effects of having recently consumed
               marijuana. I told Numair that based on the odor coming from her
               room I did not believe she did not have anything illegal. I
               told her that I would be forwarding the information to the
               Whitman County Prosecutor's Office and request charges for
               Possession of Marijuana. I offered Numair information about
               resources available to her if she thinks she has a drug problem
               (this is her 3rd contact regarding drugs in less than 2
               months). I ended my contact with Numair. Charges forwarded to
               Whitman County Prosecutor for possession of marijuana. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 5th day of January, 2016, in Pullman,

               hours I was dispatched to the report of found property at
               Northside Residence Hall. I call the complainant, Acacia L
               Kapusta (082/25/89). Kapusta is the RED for the hall. She told
               me a custodian was in room 244 cleaning the sink today. The
               custodian saw a Daisy BB gun lying on a bed in the room. The
               box for the BB gun was under the other bed in the room. There
               were no occupants in the room as they are gone on winter break.
               Kapusta was instructed to call the police. She said the room is
               rented by Andrew D. Norvell (02/07/97) and Matthew T. Abramo
               (09/04/97). I told Kapusta that I would not be keying into the
               room to seize the BB gun. Kapusta will make contact with the
               residents upon their return after winter break. I called both
               Abramo and Norvell. Both men are currently out of town. I
               educated them on WSU Housing's weapons policy and how to remedy
               the situation. I left Kapusta a message regarding my contact

               6Z0167381 2. NARRATIVE: On 01/05/16 at approximately 1803 hours
               I was driving southbound on Stadium Way near North Fairway when
               I noticed a Lexus SUV heading northbound on Stadium Way. The
               Lexus appeared to be traveling faster than the posted 20 MPH
               zone and I activated my in car radar (vehicle 4). I obtained a
               reading of 31 MPH for the Lexus. I turned around and initiated
               a traffic stop at Stadium Way and Cougar Way. The Lexus turned
               left on to Cougar Way and came to a stop near Perham Hall. I
               contacted the driver, Vinh N. Huynh 12/29/67, identified
               myself, informed Huynh that I was recording, and explained the
               reason for the stop. I asked for Huynh's driver's license.
               Huynh stated he was helping move his son to Pullman and his
               wallet was packed away somewhere. I asked Huynh if he had any
               other forms of ID with him and he said no. Huynh provided me
               with the vehicle registration and an expired proof of
               insurance. Huynh provided his name and date of birth verbally.
               I returned to my patrol car and ran Huynh through dispatch.
               Dispatch stated Huynh's was suspended in the 2nd degree through
               Washington and expired as of 12/29/15. I returned to Huynh and
               asked him to speak with me on the sidewalk. As soon as we got
               on the sidewalk Huynh without prompt began telling me why he
               was driving. I asked Huynh if he knew his license was suspended
               and he said he did. I told Huynh that he was under arrest and
               handcuffed (D/L) him. I advised Huynh that he was being audio
               and video recorded. I read Huynh his Miranda Rights off my
               department issued card and Huynh stated he understood his
               rights. Huynh was searched incident to arrest and no weapons or
               illegal items were found. I placed Huynh in the backseat of my
               patrol. I contacted Huynh's wife, Hoang-Uyen Thi Nguyen
               03/01/70, who was in the passenger seat. I explained the
               situation to Nguyen and she knew Huynh was suspended. I
               explained that Huynh would be taken to Pullman Police
               Department where he would be fingerprinted, photographed, and
               released. I gave Nguyen the address for PPD and cleared. Once
               at PPD Huynh was fingerprinted and photographed. I issued Huynh
               a sector citation for DWLS 2nd and explained the citation.
               Huynh was provided with his copy and released from custody. END

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0042 SYNOPSIS: Agency Assist for Seattle
               Police Department. Third party report of a possible rape that
               occurred on the west side of Washington. The subject was
               reported as being a WSU Student. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 01-06-16 at approximately 0358
               hours Dispatch radioed me to see if I could call them on the
               telephone. I called Dispatch and they advised Seattle Police
               Department (SPD) was requesting an agency assist for a welfare
               check. Dispatch advised there was a third party report of a
               possible rape that occurred on the west side of Washington,
               however the complainant mentioned the victim was a WSU student.
               Disptach advised the complainant, Mitchell M. Alvarez (DOB 03-
               15-95), said they were worried about their friend Jaqueline S.
               Hansen (DOB 10-13-95) who may have been raped. Dispatch
               provided me with Alvarez contact information. I called him on
               the telephone, and a female answered the phone. She identified
               herself as Avila S. Reznowski (DOB 11-01-96). Reznowski told me
               she is Alvarez's boyfriend. When I asked to speak with Alvarez,
               she told me she was the one that originally reported this to
               the police. I asked Reznowski to tell me what happened. She
               told me her friend Hansen had recently been fighting with her
               family, so she was not staying in Bellevue with her parents.
               She said Hansen was using an online website called
               "Couchsurfing" to find a place to stay. I asked Reznowski what
               "Couchsuring" was, and she said it was a website individuals
               could use to find a place to stay for the night or multiple
               nights. She said Hansen was staying at some random guy's house,
               however she does not know the guy's name or where he lives.
               Reznowski said her and Alvarez have been trying to locate
               Hansen, but have been unable to. She told me she is definitely
               somewhere near Seattle, but unsure where. Reznowski said they
               last heard from Hansen around midnight or 0100 hours. She told
               me they had been communicating by Snapchat, and that she was
               acting really weird. When I asked her if she could provide me
               with more details on how she was acting odd, she did not say
               anything but handed the phone to her boyfriend Alvarez. Alvarez
               said Reznowski and Hansen are best friends. He said Hansen had
               been sending Reznowski Snapchats. One of the Snapchats
               mentioned she had just woken up and a guy was having sex with
               her. Alvarez said they received another Snapchat from Hansen
               saying she was scared because she could hear the guy awake in
               the house. Alvarez mentioned she sent several more saying how
               much she loves Reznowski and how they are bestfriends. Alvarez

               said they thought this was odd, and it sounded as if Hansen was
               saying her goodbye's to Reznowski. Alvarez told me Reznowski
               and him tried calling/texting Hansen several times. Hansen
               never answered any of their phone calls or returned any of
               their text messages. Alvarez said Hansen had not read any of
               the texts either because they can see when somebody reads the
               texts. Alvarez told me they have contacted several different
               police departments near the Seattle area, but none of them have
               been able to do anything without an address. I told Alvarez to
               please call me if he hears from Hansen. I contacted Dispatch to
               see if I could speak with the Seattle Police Department Officer
               (SPD) who was working on the case. Dispatch advised they
               provided them with my phone number and someone would be
               contacting me. I soon received a phone call from Operator 8
               from SPD. She told me they received the same information from
               Alvarez and Reznowski. I was able to provide Operator 8 with
               another possible address for Hansen. No further action at this
               time. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the
               laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 6th day of January, 2016, in Pullman,
