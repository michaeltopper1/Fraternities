    Narrative: RVWD: 316 / OFC: ENW/328 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0027 SYNOPSIS: Report of a fire alarm at
               the Holland Library Garage. The cause was determined to be a
               ruptured pipe. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 01/04/16 around 1638 hrs I responded to the
               Holland Library Garage for a fire alarm. Upon my arrival I
               noticed Pullman Fire had already arrived, and as I entered the
               garage I could see water flowing down the ramp. As I entered
               the parking level I saw a vertical pipe, which I was later told
               was a sprinkler system relief pipe, which had ruptured and was
               spraying water. Pullman Fire assessed the situation and I was
               later told the cause of the alarm had been the pipe I saw. They
               went on to explain that due to the temperature change the pipe
               probably froze and the plug near the bottom of the pipe busted.
               WSU Life Safety personnel were on scene and effecting repairs
               before I was told I could clear. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               4th day of January, 2016, in Pullman, Washington.
