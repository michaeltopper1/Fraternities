               WA/C97422E backed into WA/21272E while backing out of a parking
               space. WA/21272E was parked, unoccupied along a yellow curb in
               the Community Hall parking lot, just off of "B" Street. DRIVER
               1: William J. Larsonberg (09-10-78) VEHICLE 1: WA/C97422E
               INSURANCE: USAA 02021 90 19U 7104 5 DAMAGE: $20 Small scrapes

               WA/21272E INSURANCE: WSU Self Insured DAMAGE: $350 dent to
               passenger side of bed area NARRATIVE: On 02-25-16, at
               approximately 1313 hours, I was dispatched to a non-injury
               accident in the Community Hall parking lot, just off of "B"
               Street. Upon my arrival to the parking lot, I identified the
               driver's who were involved in the accident. They both said they
               were not injured. William J. Larsonberg said he was backing his
               Toyota Tundra (WA/C97422E) out of a parking stall. He noticed a
               white truck parked along the yellow curb behind his truck. He
               used his rear view camera as he was backing and thought he had
               plenty of room. He said he backed his truck into the white
               Dodge (WA/21272E). The collision caused small scrapes to the
               back bumper of the Toyota and a small dent in the passenger
               side of the bed area of the Dodge. I estimate the cost to
               repair the Toyota to be approximately $20. I estimate the cost
               to repair the Dodge to be approximately $350. I took photos of
               the damage to each vehicle and downloaded them to the "Files"
               section of the report when I returned to the Police Department.
               Both Drivers were given my business card with the Police Case
               Number on it. Both drivers exchanged information. Since Jamison
               is a WSU Parking and Transportation employee, and was working
               at the time of the accident, he will fill out a WSU Employee
               Accident Form. He said he will e-mail a copy of the form to me
               so I can attach it to the case. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               25th day of February, 2016 in Pullman, Washington.

               hours I was dispatched to a bike found in the roadway. The RP,
               Cheryl Oliver, was going to leave the bike near the Fine Arts
               parking garage entrance. I responded and located the bike. It
               did not appear to be damaged. It was also not in riding
               condition due to the lack of pressure in the tires. Oliver was
               not on scene. I took the bike back to the station and ran it
               via dispatch and no returns came back. I spoke with Oliver on
               the phone and she confirmed the bike had oddly been in the one
               way exit onto Stadium Way out of the Fine Arts garage. She had
               not seen anyone. On the bike, a yellow and black GMC Denali
               road bike ($380), was a University Of Alabama registration
               number and bar code of 00294. I emailed the University to see
               if they have any current data on the owner. Case pending
               results from Alabama. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 26th day of February,

               and set up a perimeter around the building. Pullman PD observed
               that the door on the east side of the building was open.
