               duty), who showed me spray painted graffiti on the 6th floor of
               Gannon and Goldsworthy Halls in the outside stairwells. Allen
               said she talked with other hall staff and they think the
               graffiti would have showed up in the last week. The graffiti
               was an outline of a "P" and other stenciled animals on the
               ground. I took photos and saved them to the case. There are no

               hit his head. Medics responded and found the boy to be
               medically clear. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 02/28/16 at approximately 1358 hours Pullman Fire
               was dispatched to the SRC for a 3 year old boy who fell and hit
               his head. I responded and then I arrived on scene Pullman Fire
               was already tending to the child who appeared in good spirits.
               I asked two unidentified employees what happened and they told
               me the child and his older (still juvenile) brother were
               running down the hall from the vending machines and the 3 year
               old tripped and hit his head on the stairs. I asked if anyone
               saw it and they said no. I found no defects in the carpet that
               would have caused the child to fall. I checked with the medics
               and they advised that the child was medically cleared, so I
               left. I returned to WSUPD and checked the video footage of the
               SRC. I saw the two kids running and the 3 year old tripped and
               fell into the stairwell. The child's father was a few feet
               behind the children and swooped up the kid and consoled him.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 28th day of February, 2016, in

               the hall director's space. The vehicle was identified as a
               silver, 2001 Toyota 4Runner (WA Lic. ARP6933). I arrived on
               scene and saw that the vehicle was parked in the hall
               director's space. The vehicle had a standard WSU parking permit

               returned from work and the back door to her apartment at
               Chinook was open. Nothing appeared to be missing and resident's
               said it did not appear as if anyone had actually entered their
               apartment. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 02-28-16 at approximately 2129 hours I was
               dispatched to the report of a possible residential burglary at
               Chinook Apartments #D19, located at 710 SE Chinook Dr. Dispatch
               advised the complainant and her roommate returned from work and
               noticed their back door to their apartment was open. Dispatch
               advised the resident's have already been inside and nothing
               appeared to have been taken and nobody was found inside. I
               arrived on scene. I went to #D19 and I met with the
               complainant, Daejhanai L. Hare (DOB 11-11-93) and her roommate
               Aquelio J. Vinson (DOB 02-10-94). Hare and Vinson told me they
               have both been through their apartment and nobody was inside.
               Hare told me that her and Vinson both left for work at about
               1345 hours on 02-28-16. She said when they both returned from
               work around 2126 hours on 02-28-16 they noticed the back door
               to their apartment was open. Their back door faces Chinook Dr.
               I asked them if they had locked the door, and they both said
               yes. They told me they rarely use that door, but they always
               keep it locked. I looked at the door, but there did not appear
               to be any damages from forced entry. I asked them if anything
               appeared to be missing from their apartment, and they both said
               everything appeared to still be there. I asked if it looked
               like anyone had been inside their apartment, and they both said
               no. Hare and Vinson both told me they have issues with some of
               their locks on their doors, but they have not been fixed yet.
               They both asked me what they should do about it. I told Hare
               and Vinson they should put in a work order to have their locks
               fixed. I also told them I would forward a copy of my report to
               WSU Housing. I told Hare and Vinson in the meantime they may
               want to prop their couch or chair in front of their back door
               to prevent it from opening for now. I told them there is a good
               chance the wind blew it open because it may have not been
               completely shut. I told Hare and Vinson to please call me if
               they noticed anything missing from their apartment. I told them
               if their door is found open in the future to call 911 and wait
               for us to show up before going inside of their apartment in
               case someone is inside. I cleared the scene. No further action
               at this time. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury

               Wilmer Hall #304. Upon my arrival I contacted RED Richard
               Wallace. He stated the R/A's on rounds could smell the odor of
               marijuana coming from #304. We went up to the floor. When we
               open the door from the stairwell to the hallway there was

               with the odor was 304. I knocked on the door and Madison
               Schultz answered the door. There was a strong odor of burnt
               marijuana coming from the room. I asked her if she knew why I
               was there and she said she didn't. I told her why and she told
               me she had been at her sisters house off campus smoking
               marijuana. I told her I thought she had smoked in the room and
               was not being truthful. She denied smoking there. While
               speaking to her not only could I smell the odor, but Schultz's
               eyes were blood shot and watery and her speech was slurred. I
               told her it was a violation for her to even smoke marijuana
               since she was under 21 years of age. She said she knew that. I
               told her I was going to refer her to student conduct for the
               violation. I asked if she had any question and she didn't.
