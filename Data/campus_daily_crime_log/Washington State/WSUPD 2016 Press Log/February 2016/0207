               erratically driven vehicle. Unable to locate. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 02/07/16 at
               approximately 0856 hours I was dispatched to a traffic offense
               that occurred at the intersection of NE B St and NE Campus St.
               There were two reporting parties. One reporting party stated
               that a white Ford Explorer turned right off of NE B St onto NE
               Campus St without stopping at the sign. The vehicle was said to
               be driving 40 MPH and this reporting party stated the vehicle
               then drove onto a lawn and clipped a tree. A plate of AVU8362
               (which was not correct) was provided. This was said to have
               occurred 5 minutes prior to calling. Sgt. Griffin and I checked
               campus but could not locate the vehicle. We went to the scene
               and could see tire marks on the roadway which were consistent
               with a vehicle traveling south on NE B St and turning west onto
               NE Campus St. The tire marks went into the oncoming lane of
               travel and then up onto a hill side into some ivy and back onto
               the road. The tracks then lead to Spokane St. There did not
               appear to be damage to the ivy, nor were any trees struck. I
               contacted both reporting parties, Karin Harrington-Gibbs &
               Jennifer Cheslek. Karin stated she was turning east onto Campus
               St from Spokane St when the suspect vehicle turned onto Campus
               St from B St. Karin said the vehicle did not stop for the stop
               sign and was in her lane of travel. Karin said the driver over
               corrected and drove up onto the hillside, before traveling back
               down and onto Spokane St. Karin described the driver as an
               average college student. Karin described the vehicle as a white
               SUV. Cheslek said she was traveling north on Spokane St behind
               Karin (whom she did not know also reported the incident) when
               she saw the suspect vehicle turn off of B St onto Campus St.
               Cheslek described the vehicle as traveling 40 MPH. Cheslek said
               the vehicle turned into the oncoming lane of travel and then
               drove up onto the hillside. Cheslek said she thought the
               vehicle hit a tree before coming down the hill and continuing
               south on Spokane St. Cheslek described the vehicle as a newer
               white Ford Explorer. I tried various combinations for the plate
               provided, but could not come up with a white or cream SUV.
               Unable to locate vehicle. Pullman was notified of the call as
               it occurred in their jurisdiction. They were busy and asked
               that I handle it. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 7th day of February,

               Rafael Salgado 04/18/95 Suspect Harassment NARRATIVE: On
               02/07/16 at approximately 1130 hours I was dispatched to a
               Harassment call at Gannon Hall room 331. I called the reporting
               party, Taylor Foster, and asked how I could help. Foster
               explained that she broke up with her boy friend, Rafael
               Salgado, 3 weeks ago. Foster said since the break up Salgado
               has been showing up every weekend and bothering her. Foster
               explained that Salgado would stay in her room the last two
               weeks, but she no longer wanted to communicate with him. Foster
               said that Salgado had been texting her since yesterday stating
               he was coming to campus to get his "stuff". I asked Foster what
               he was referring to and she said she did not know. I asked
               Foster how many times and when Salgado texted her. Foster said
               that Salgado texted her at 0200 hours on 02/06/16 and then on
               02/07/16 he texted her at 0900, 1000, 1043, and 1124. I asked
               Foster if the texts contained any threats and she said no. I
               asked Foster if she has told Salgado that she does not want him
               texting or calling her. Foster said she told him during a phone
               call. I asked Foster to send a text to Salgado specifically
               telling him not to attempt contact with her further, and she
               did while we were talking. I called Salgado and asked about
               what he needed to pick up from Foster. Salgado said he bought
               Foster a TV back in August. Salgado then corrected himself and
               said the TV was for both of them when he comes to visit her on
               Campus. Salgado is not a student at WSU and he lives in
               Spokane. I told Salgado that if he bought the TV as a gift he
               would have to talk with the court since it would be a civil
               issue. I told Salgado I would ask Foster if she wanted to give
               him the TV, which I did and she said she did not. I told
               Salgado that Foster wants no further contact and told him it
               would be best to cut his loses and not pursue Foster any
               further. Salgado asked if he could just call her and have a
               friendly conversation with her and I told him that she does not
               want communication with him and if he attempted, the issue
               could turn criminal in nature. Salgado said he understood. I
               went and met with Foster and provided her with a DV pamphlet,
               victim's rights card, and my business card. I explained
               different resources to her and I left. At approximately 1600
               hours I called Foster back to check if Salgado had called or
               texted her and she said that he had not. Nothing further. I

               hours I was driving through the Green 1 Lot of SE Nevada St

               people if they needed any assistance at which point I was told
               they were working on the door as the vehicle had been broken
               into. I asked one of the subjects, identified as Lani Kailea,
               to tell me what happened. Kailea said she parked her car in the
               Green 1 Lot around 0300 hours on 02/06/16. Kailea said when she
               went back to her car around 0900 hours she noticed the door was
               not completely shut and saw a dent in the front fender well

               damage to the frame of the driver's window as well as a chip to

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0625 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched to an
               agency assist for the Pullman Police Department. The
               complainant reported that someone had been shot with a gun.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 02-07-
               2016 at about 2019 hrs Sergeant Griffin and I were dispatched
               to an agency assist for the Pullman Police Department (PPD) at
               the trailer park located at 605 NW Fisk Street. Dispatch
               advised that someone had been shot with a gun. Sergeant Griffin
               and I arrived on scene and assisted PPD officers with securing
               the scene and conducting the initial investigation. The suspect
               was apprehended without incident, and the victim was
               transported to the Pullman Regional Hospital via ambulance.
               Sergeant Griffin and I located a trail of fresh blood on the
               ground beginning at the northwest corner of the trailer park
               near where the victim was located. The blood trail continued in
               a southeast direction across the trailer park and ended near
               where the suspect was taken into custody. The perimeter of the
               crime scene was secured with crime scene tape, and the path of
               the blood trail was marked with traffic cones. While I was
               stationed at the perimeter of the crime scene, I contacted and
               interviewed the following individuals: Raymond J. Schaff (DOB
               07-02-1936). Schaff resides at 605 NW Fisk Street #42. Schaff
               said about 30 to 45 minutes ago he was inside his residence and
               heard what he thought might have been one gun shot. Schaff said
               he had observed "James Gray" and "Candy" arguing outside
               earlier that afternoon. Larry L. Schutz (DOB 11-05-1953) and
               Laurie R. Schutz (DOB 03-20-1958). Larry and Laurie are husband
               and wife and reside at 605 NW Fisk Street #56. Larry told me
               that about 30 minutes ago both he and Laurie were inside their
               trailer and heard some yelling and arguing coming from outside.
               Larry said the arguing consisted of male and female voices, and
               Larry thought the voices were "mainly female". Larry said he
               recognized the voices and thought it might have been "James"
               and "Candy" arguing. Larry told me that Laurie thought she
               heard one gunshot, but he did not hear anything like that.
               After Laurie told him that she had heard a shot, they turned
               the television down but did not hear anything else. For more
               information, see related case 16-P01264. My Vievu camera was
               activated during this incident. For more information, see the
               video, which has been downloaded into the permanent digital
               evidence file. No further action at this time. Olmstead/339 I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0627 SYNOPSIS: Report of an ongoing
               problem with noise at Kamiak Apts H3. Resident was warned. She
               was also extremely hostile toward the residents below her, the
               housing coordinator, and police. The case will be sent to WSU
               Housing so they are aware of the situation. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Natalie DeClare/110775 Warned Noise
               Complaint 2. NARRATIVE: On 02/07/16 at about 2141 hrs Dispatch
               advised of a complaint regarding an ongoing issue with noise
               coming from apartment H3 at Kamiak Apartments. The residents of
               H1 had tried to speak with the resident of H3, Natalie DeClare
               (110775), but she was extremely hostile toward them. The
               apartment coordinator also tried to speak with DeClaire but
               received an equally hostile response. They said she was not
               threatening but was impossible to speak with or reason with.
               The resident of H1, Gaber S. Abdellatief Abdelrazeq (121277),
               told me there are often loud mechanical sounds coming from the
               apartment above them in the middle of the night, right above
               his children's bedroom. They played me a recording of the sound
               they took from inside their children's room the last time it
               occurred. It was a very loud buzzing sound, which sounded
               similar to a dentist drill, but I did not know exactly what the
               sound was. I explained the Pullman City noise ordinance to them
               and advised them the next time they had a problem with the
               noise to call the police and we would come try to handle the
               situation for them. I told Abdellatief Abdelrazeq I would go
               and try to talk to the resident upstairs about the issue. I was
               told by the apartment coordinator the resident was Natalie
               DeClare, formerly Natalie Florez, who has had numerous problems
               with housing and the police in the past. I went to apartment H3
               and knocked on the door. I attempted to speak with DeClaire
               about the issue but she was extraordinarily hostile toward me.
               I explained that if I received a complaint in the future and
               was able to verify the noise she would receive an infraction
               for the noise. I asked why DeClaire was so hostile and she
               said, "Because you're a cop. I don't want to get shot,
               murdered, or raped." I said she had nothing to worry about
               because I had no desire to do any of those things. She replied,
               "You people are known for murdering, raping, assaulting, and
               beating people." I cleared the scene. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 08 day of February, 2016, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer
