               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On February 23, 2016 at about
               0903 hours WSU Police were toned out to a burglary alarm at
               McCluskey Services. Whitcom advised this appears to be a test
               account without a zone location. This alarm had not been
               received by Whitcom before. I responded to McCluskey where I
               contacted Ryan Gehring, WSU Life Safety Supervisor. After some
               further research it appears to be a test account that
               accidentally went live or on line. There was no emergency and
               the account will be better labeled for future reference. No
               further investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of

               February 23, 2016 at about 1233 hours I received a report from
               WSU Aware Network regarding Krishna Yadav. Yadav had made
               suicidal comments while in the Ombudsman's Office on February
               22, 2016. According to the report, when Yadav was leaving the
               office he made a motion like he had a gun to his head and said
               he would kill himself. Yadav then said he was just kidding.
               There was no call to the police or 911 at the time of incident.
               It is unknown what time of day this incident occurred. Sgt.
               Macy and I went to Yadav's residence at Steptoe V301 on
               February 23, 2016 at about 1247 hours. We were unable to make
               contact with Yadav. There was no answer when I knocked on the
               door or rang the doorbell. We returned to the residence at
               about 1515 hours on February 23, 2016. We made contact with a
               female who told us she was ill and Yadav was not in the
               apartment. The apartment door was open. I could not see anyone
               else in the apartment. The female said she saw Yadav yesterday.
               She has not seen him today as he is in school during the day.
               Further investigation required. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 23rd day of

               room. Carney exited the room and said I could search the room.
               I asked her how old she was and she said 18. I asked if she had
               a medical marijuana card, she said she did not. I asked if
               there was any marijuana in the room she said there was not. I
               asked if she had been smoking marijuana and she said she was at
               a place where they were smoking marijuana. I then explained
               that she had the right to deny the search, stop the search or
               restrict where I searched. Carney asked if she refused the
               search, would it change anything. I told her it would not since
               I would still be warning her and sending my report to student
               conduct. She then decided to not allow me to search her room.
               She again said there was no marijuana in the room. Forward to
               student conduct. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 24th day of

               Hall, located at 1620 NE Cougar Way. I called the Hall Director

               that he had smelled the odor of marijuana coming from room #416
               in Streit Hall, at approximately 2345 hours today. I asked

               coming from room #416, with 10 being absolutely positive.

               marijuana, with 10 being absolutely positive. Wallace told me

               marijuana burn class conducted by the police department, and he
               said yes. Wallace said he last attended a controlled burn class
               conducted by Sgt. Daniels in the Fall of 2015. Wallace told me
               he also worked at the University of Kansas for two years, and
               he worked at the University of Illinois for three years. I
               asked Wallace if he has reported other drug incidents at
               Washington State University and the other universities he
               worked at, and what were the results. Wallace told me he has
               probably called about 50 other times and in all of those
               incidents there have been drugs found or resident's had been
               smoking marijuana in the room. I went to a drugs call on 02-21-
               16 at room #416 in Streit Hall and the resident of the room is
               Brandon R. Mitchell (DOB 12-29-96). Mitchell is 19 years of age
               and when I dealt with him on 02-21-16 he had marijuana in his
               room which he was warned for. Mitchell told me he does not have
               a medical marijuana card. I asked Wallace if anyone was still
               in the room, and he said yes there was at least one. They said
               someone left the room recently, but had returned. Ofc.
