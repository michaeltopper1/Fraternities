               approximately 1009 hours I was dispatched to a trespassing call
               on the 2nd floor of Orton Hall. I was told that there was a
               male subject on the floor who had been trespassed by "the
               school" but not law enforcement. I arrived on scene and met
               with the RA (only identified as Carlos). Carlos told me that a
               subject named Jesus was in room 223 and he was already kicked
               out of the HEP (High School Equivalency Program) and was told
               he could not be at the residence hall. I went to room 223 and
               knocked on the door. The door was opened and I saw three people
               inside. I asked them if they lived in the room and they all
               said no. At this time another subject showed up to the door. I
               asked her if she lived there and she said no. I asked all
               subjects for their names or IDs, and was provided with them. I
               asked them why they were at the room and they said the resident
               (who wasn't present) invited them. Carlos confirmed this. I
               told the four they could not be in the hall unescorted and told
               them that if they returned they would be subject to arrest for
               trespassing. All four said they understood. I escorted the
               group out and watched as they got into a car and drove away. I
               spoke with Lori Manzanares (HEP coordinator) and she explained
               that Anna (resident of 223) had invited them to the room and
               Lori explained to her that she could not do that since Jesus
               was already told not to return. I suggested to Lori that she
               work with the AG's office to put together Trespass Admonitions
               in the future when they "trespass" someone from the residence
               hall. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 1st day of February,

               report a Bellevue Police car on campus acting suspicious.
               Caller was contacted, Bellevue officer was notified, and
               Pullman PD was asked to perform extra patrols. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 02/01/16 at
               approximately 1452 hours Whitcom radioed the report of a caller
               reporting a Bellevue Police car on campus acting suspicious.
               Whitcom radioed that the caller was following the officer on
               Wilson Rd and then the vehicle turned onto Stadium Way. Before
               I told Whitcom to have the caller discontinue following the
               marked patrol car they said the police car was driving down N.
               Fairway towards the gold course. I was aware a Bellevue officer
               was coming to WSUPD to put on a training later in the evening.
               Whitcom further advised me that the caller was making odd
               statements on the phone and did not want to provide his
               information. I checked the call and found a phone number of
               509-769-8490. I called the phone number and after ringing twice
               the phone was picked up and then hung up. My phone line then
               rang and I saw a name of Jordan Dunn with the above phone
               number listed. I introduced myself and asked how I could help
               him. The caller (who I'll refer to as Dunn) questioned where I
               was calling from. After again explaining the department I work
               for I asked Dunn if he called 911 because of a suspicious
               police car. Dunn said he did and said that he has seen in the
               news recently about officers getting killed because of police
               impersonators. Dunn then went on to explain that the officer
               did not like him filming him and clearly wanted to get away
               from him. Dunn then said that it is not illegal to film the
               police. I told Dunn that he was correct that he could film the
               police and then I asked him if he was following the police car
               on foot or in a vehicle. Dunn said he first saw the officer
               when he was filling up the patrol car and he began filming the
               officer. I asked Dunn if he was using a video camera or his
               phone and told him that it was possible the officer didn't know
               he was filming him. Dunn said he was using his dash camera and
               the officer clearly knew he was being filmed as he was looking
               at Dunn oddly. I asked Dunn what it was the officer did that
               was suspicious. Dunn said that the officer was driving all
               around campus and it was obvious that he did not want Dunn
               following him. I explained to Dunn that as a police officer I
               would not want him following me either and would feel
               uncomfortable. Dunn explained that the Bellevue officer was out
               of his jurisdiction and had no right to be here unless he was

               doing an investigation. I told Dunn he was incorrect and that
               the officer was in town for a training. I explained to Dunn
               about the Mutual Aid Peace Officers Power Act. Dunn was
               hesitant to believe me that the Bellevue officer had the
               authority to be where ever he wanted. Dunn went on to tell me
               how only WSP and Sheriff's had authority outside of their
               jurisdiction. While speaking with Dunn I apparently said
               "Jordan" as he questioned me about it. Dunn asked if I used his
               first name and then corrected himself and said "a" first name.
               I told him I did not intend to. Dunn then became upset and told
               me it was illegal to wire tap his phone. I told Dunn it wasn't
               illegal, but one would need a search warrant to do so. I told
               Dunn I did not wire tap his phone. Dunn said that I could not
               trace his phone. I assured Dunn I did not trace his phone. Dunn
               then alluded to (he clearly did not want to ask) wanting to
               know how I knew his name. I reminded Dunn that he called my
               phone and it is equipped with caller ID. I told him the name
               Jordan Dunn came up on the phone and that was how I knew his
               name. Dunn said, "Oh." Dunn thanked me for calling and
               educating him on the law and I disconnected. I contacted Det.
               Amir Mousavi (the Bellevue Officer) and notified him of the
               call. I asked Mousavi if he noticed if he was being followed.
               Mousavi said he thought a silver car was following him closely
               on Campus. I checked Spillman and located a Silver VW Jetta
               belonging to Dunn. I cautioned Mousavi about Dunn's comments
               and that he had been following him around. Mousavi requested
               that Pullman PD perform extra patrols of the Holiday Inn
               Express parking lot, as that was where he was staying. Mousavi
               was worried about Dunn damaging his patrol car. I contacted
               Sgt. Dornes and notified him of the events. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               1st day of February, 2016, in Pullman, Washington.

               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0526 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched
               to a report of harassment. The complaint reported that she had
               received some suspicious text messages. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 02-01-2016 at about 1627 hrs I
               was dispatched to a report of harassment in Regents Hall,
               located at 1580 NE Cougar Way. I contacted the complainant,
               Katelynn M. Piazza (DOB 04-07-1994), on the telephone. Piazza
               is the assistant hall director for Regents Hall. Piazza
               reported that on 01-27-2016 at 0819 hrs she received a
               suspicious text message on her cellular telephone. Piazza's
               cellular telephone number is 425-235-4844, and her service
               provider is Verizon. Piazza said the text message originated
               from the following number: 702-478-1621. The message addressed
               Piazza by her first name, but her name was misspelled. Piazza
               replied to the message and inquired about who was sending her
               the text message. The sender replied and stated they had
               obtained "pics" of Piazza from a friend. Piazza did not receive
               any further communication until 02-01-2016 between 1622 hrs and
               1628 hrs. During this time period, Piazza received additional
               text messages from the same telephone number. The sender stated
               that they had nude photographs of Piazza and threatened to post
               them online. Piazza communicated with the sender via text
               messages and demanded to know who was contacting her. The
               sender would not answer her questions and said they were going
               to post the photographs and would provide Piazza with a link.
               Piazza has received no further communication from the sender. I
               asked Piazza if anyone could realistically have any naked
               pictures of her. Piazza did not believe anyone could have naked
               photographs of her and has never provided naked photographs to
               anyone. Piazza provided me with screen shots of the text
               message conversation. The screen shots have been downloaded
               into Spillman and attached to this case. I instructed Piazza to
               have the offending telephone number blocked, and told her to
               notify me immediately if she had any further contact from
               anyone claiming to have naked photographs of her. Piazza said
               she would do this. I told Piazza that this was most likely
               someone playing a joke on her or some type of scam. I told
               Piazza to forward any additional text messages to me and to
               have no further communication with the sender. I called the
               offending telephone number and an automated message stated that
               the text mail subscriber was not available. I reviewed the
               facts in this investigation. I determined that the harassing
               contact has been minimal, the contact has stopped, and Piazza

               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0530 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched
               to a report of nuisance telephone calls. The complainant
               reported that she had received a harassing telephone call.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 02-01-
               2016 at about 1901 hrs I was dispatched to a report of nuisance
               telephone calls at Stevens Hall, located at 600 NE Veterans
               Mall. I contacted the complainant, Gisel M. Miranda (DOB 07-24-
               1997), on the telephone. Miranda resides at Stevens Hall #205.
               Miranda reported that on 02-01-2016 between 1400 hrs and 1500
               hrs she received a suspicious telephone call on her cellular
               telephone. Miranda's telephone number is 562-347-0882. Miranda
               said that the number for the incoming telephone call was
               blocked and was unknown. Miranda reported that the male caller
               knew her name and identified himself as "Mike". The caller said
               he was conducting a survey for a fraternity initiation and
               proceeded to ask Miranda a series of questions. Miranda said
               the questions were about all kinds of things, such as height
               preference in men, lips, tongues, male extremities, skin tone,
               and what she would do if he was in his underwear. Miranda said
               she could hear noise like a television or voices in the
               background, and the caller was laughing. Miranda was concerned
               because the caller knew her name, and she had no idea who would
               have called her. I checked the WSU Directory and found that
               Miranda's full name and telephone number were listed on the
               directory. I instructed Miranda to have her number removed from
               the directory. I told Miranda that this was most likely a prank
               telephone call and instructed her to contact me immediately if
               she received additional calls. I reviewed the facts in this
               investigation. Miranda only received one harassing telephone
               call and no additional telephone calls were received. Further
               investigation is not warranted at this time, and I recommend
               this case be closed. No further action at this time.
               Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under penalty of perjury

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0531 02/01/16 SYNOPSIS: Suspicious
               voicemail message left at the WSU President's Office. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On February 2,
               2016 at about 1738 hours I was assigned to investigate a
               suspicious voicemail message that was left at the WSU
               President's Office. The telephone number associated with the
               message is 509-570-6411. An unknown male caller left a message
               regarding "Dana Cooper" who he said was a professor. The caller
               goes to talk about how Dana Cooper is seeing a man named John
               Mahoney. The caller then references about a "disturbing
               conversation" he had with Chanda Johnson. According to the
               caller Chanda is obsessed with John and want to get to Dana.
               The caller said Chanda has a very serious disorder but does not
               say what it is. The caller goes on to say how he is extremely
               worried as Chanda has a propensity for anger and cruelty. The
               message continues to ramble on for another few minutes. The
               caller wanted to remain anonymous and did not leave his
               information. I searched the WSU database and could not locate
               anyone named Dana Cooper, John Mahoney, or Chanda Johnson using
               a variety of spellings. It does not appear that they are
               affiliated with WSU. At about 2037 hours I called 509-570-6411
               and spoke with the anonymous male caller. He told me that he is
               a former Hell's Angel member who is in bad standing with the
               club. He was affiliated with the club in California several
               years ago. He went on to say he is not a "snitch" but wants
               John to "fucking leave Chanda alone." I learned that Chanda is
               his ex wife who he was married to for only 1.5 to 2 years.
               Chanda is "mental" according to him. Chanda lives in the Coeur
               d'Alene area and John lives in Spokane Valley. The caller had
               no idea where Dana lived or worked as he only knew about her
               second hand from Chanda. The caller thought that Dana was a
               professor at WSU because of what he saw on the internet. He was
               not able to verify this information with me while on the
               telephone. After talking with the caller it was clear that he
               just want's to stay out of the drama and have John stay away
               from Chanda. He did not want to provide any information and
               remained anonymous. We talked for about 15 minutes before
               ending the conversation. I received a telephone call from the
               caller at around 2100 hours. He called back to tell me that he
               thinks Dana Cooper is a professor at the University of Idaho in
               Moscow, ID. I checked the U of I web site but I was still not
               able to locate anyone by that name at U of I. No further
               investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0532 02/01/16 SYNOPSIS: Smoke from an
               electrical outlet in the floor of Vet Teaching Hospital 1410.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               February 1, 2016 at about 2012 hours Pullman Fire and WSU
               Police were dispatched to the Veterinary Teaching Hospital for
               an outlet with smoke coming out of it. I responded to the
               building and was the first emergency responder to arrive on
               scene. When I arrived the building was still occupied and the
               fire alarm was not active. I went to room 1410. There were
               custodians in the room cleaning the floors. I could smell the
               faint odor of burnt electrical. The custodians told me they
               were cleaning the floor and observed some black smoke coming
               from an uncovered electrical floor outlet. The custodians said
               they did not get any water or cleaning product in the outlet.
               Pullman Fire arrived and determined the outlet was warmer in
               temperature than a nearby comparable outlet. I called WSU
               Facilities Operations and a worker responded. The outlet was no
               longer energized and Facilities Operations will make the
               necessary repairs. The outlet most likely shorted out due to
               debris and/or liquid in it because it was not covered. No fire
               emergency, no further investigation. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               1st day of February, 2016, in Pullman, Washington.
