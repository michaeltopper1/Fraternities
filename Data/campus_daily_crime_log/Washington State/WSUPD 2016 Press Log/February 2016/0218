               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0818 SYNOPSIS: Student was scamed and
               blackmailed over social media. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 02/18/16 at approximately 1640
               hours I was dispatched to a threatening call. Dispatch stated
               Alexander J Spiese 04/24/96, was in the lobby for contact. I
               met with Spiese in the interview room. Spiese reported that
               today around 1355 hours Spiese received a facebook friend
               request from a "Clarisse Hardway" asking to be his friend.
               Spiese accepted and they began to chat using the facebook
               messenger system. The conversation started casual until Hardway
               asked Spiese to make a skype account. Spiese did and they began
               using skype to video chat. Hardway instructed Spiese to take of
               his clothes. Hardway began to instruct Spiese what to do.
               Hardway had Spiese masturbate on the video chat while Hardway
               did the same. Spiese said it was hard to see Hardway because
               her camera was fuzzy. After Spiese showed his genitals Hardway
               messaged him stating that she recorded the skype video and
               would release it to all of his family members unless he paid
               her $800 dollars. Hardway continued to blackmail Spiese to pay
               her or she would put the video on facebook and youtube. Hardway
               also told Spiese that if he went to the Police she would file a
               report saying she is really a minor when she had first
               identified herself as 22 years old. Spiese became very worried
               and decided to contact the Police. I informed Spiese what he
               had witnessed is a very common scam where people pretend to be
               young females who want to "video chat." Once they get the
               victim to perform a sexual act in front of the camera they tell
               the victim that they have recorded it and will release the
               video unless they pay them not to. I also told Spiese that
               because facebook and skype are anonymous sites, "Clarisse
               Hardway" is most likely a fake account. Spiese said he did not
               pay the money but was worried about the video because he is in
               the Army National Guard. I told Spiese that it would be best to
               inform his commanding officer about the situation. With
               Spiese's permission I sent Hardway one final facebook message
               using his account. The message stated that I was investigating
               the matter and provided my contact information and the related
               case number. I also told Hardway that Spiese did not want any
               further contact from her and if there was any contact it would
               be considered harassment. After the message was sent Spiese
               blocked Hardway's facebook account. I showed Spiese how to
               increase his facebook security so other people could not see
               personal information he posted online. Spiese also deleted his

               skype account. Spiese stated he was worried that Hardway would
               go to the Police and claim that he sought out a minor to do
               sexual acts over the internet. I explained that the facebook
               and skype messages clearly show Hardway lured him into the scam
               and she was the one who was trying to extort him. I told Spiese
               he did the right thing by reporting the incident. Spiese was
               not concerned about the crimes that Hardway committed. Rather
               he was only concerned about Hardway trying to get him in
               trouble for something he did not do. I provided Spiese with my
               business card and his case number. I told Spiese to contact me
               if anything else happened. Spiese appeared to be pleased with
               our course of action. Once the interview with Spiese was
               completed I logged onto facebook and looked up "Clarisse
               Hardway." The facebook profile was clearly fake. The profile
               had just been created on February 11th. I reported the profile
               as fake and being used to harass people to Facebook Officials.
               Spiese provided screen shots of his conversation with Hardway
               which were added to the files folder. END OF REPORT I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.

               Kreinke, Lauren G (08/28/97) Contacted NARRATIVE: On 02/18/16
               around 2157 hrs I was dispatched to a report of the odor of
               marijuana coming from room 1005 of Stephenson East. Upon my
               arrival I contacted the reporting party, later identified as
               Joshua B McPhatter (06/24/89), and lead to room 1005. As we
               were walking towards the room McPhatter told me the occupants
               had been using a spray in an attempt to mask the odor of
               marijuana coming from within the room. I walked up to the
               closed door and smelled around the crack of the door and could
               not detect the odor of marijuana coming from inside. I knocked
               on the door, which was answered by a female, later identified
               as Tatiana M Large (05/16/97). As Large opened the door I
               detected a faint odor of marijuana coming from within the room.
               I asked if I could come in and speak with her and her roommate,
               later identified as Lauren G Krienke (08/28/97), and was
               invited into the room. Once inside of the room the odor I had
               noticed while standing in the doorway disappeared. I explained
               to both Large, and Krienke why I was there and asked them about
               the odor I had noticed when the door first opened. Both Large,
               and Krienke told me there was no marijuana in the room and
               nobody had been smoking in the room prior to my arrival. As we
               continued to speak I noticed the window on the west side of the
               room was open as Large was getting ready to go out for the
               evening. We continued to speak about marijuana and Large told
               me she had some friends who had been in the room prior to my
               arrival, adding one of them had smoked a cigarette, but there
               was no marijuana in the room. After speaking with Large and
               Krienke I cleared and spoke with McPhatter, explaining there
               was no marijuana in the room. McPhatter and I cleared a short
               time later, after which I cleared this call. I recommend this
               case be closed as unfounded. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 02-18-16 at
               approximately 2331 hours, I contacted Catherine Sumida at her
               residence reference someone possibly following her. Catherine
               stated she had been working late and had walked down to her
               vehicle which was parked in the Green Lot outside of the CUE
               around 2300 hours. She stated as she got to her vehicle,
               another vehicle in the parking lot started. She did not see how
               many people were inside the vehicle and didn't pay much
               attention to it, other than notice is was a small white SUV
               style vehicle. She stated the vehicle pulled out of the parking
               space and drove to the the exit at Stadium Way. She stated it
               turned left (northbound on to Stadium Way) and she turned the
               same direction. As they were driving on Stadium Way, the
               vehicle slowed and she passed by it. She stated she continued
               on Stadium Way to Orchard were she turned right to head to her
               residence at Steptoe Apartments. As she turned onto Orchard,
               she noticed the vehicle also turned onto Orchard and was behind
               her. She continued to Valley Rd and then turned right onto
               Merman Dr and then left onto Garden Ave. The vehicle continued
               to follow her into the parking lot of Steptoe Apartments. As
               she turned left to travel to the parking lot near the P
               building, and then into the small parking lot area, the vehicle
               was still following her. Instead of parking, went around the
               parking lot and then turned back towards the area she had just
               come from and traveled back out to Merman Dr. She then turned
               right and then right onto Valley Rd. The vehicle continued to
               follow her. She then turned into the Providence Court drive and
               she observed the vehicle continue to the light at Valley Rd and
               Stadium Way. Catherine stated she did not see if the vehicle
               traveled straight through the intersection or turned left onto
               Stadium Way. She also stated she was unable to see any of the
               occupants due to the rain and headlights. Catherine was unable
               to provide any further description of the vehicle. I asked her
               if she had anyone who may follow her and she said no. She
               stated she just started here this semester. I asked her if she
               has had any other weird things happening to her and she said
               no. I gave Catherine some advice if she had this happen again.
               I also provided her with my business card with the non-
               emergency number to call if she wanted an escort to her vehicle
               in the future. I advised her to call if she remembered anything
               else and she stated she would. I cleared. I certify and declare

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: dd/329 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0826 SYNOPSIS: While on patrol I
               observed a possible domestic dispute. It was determined the
               male had been trying to keep the female from getting into a
               fight with some other subjects. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 02-18-16 at approximately 2357
               hours, I was on patrol near Global Scholars Hall when I
               observed a male and female on the sidewalk who appeared they
               may be arguing. I saw the male grab the female by the arm and
               she pushed him away. I got out and contacted the two who were
               still yelling. I told the male to sit down on the steps and
               asked the female to come speak with me. She began to walk away
               and I grabbed on to her to stop her from leaving while telling
               her to stop. She stated she didn't want to talk to me and was
               agitated. I could smell an overwhelming odor of intoxicants
               emitting from her breath and her speech was slurred. I asked
               her why she didn't want to talk to me and she said they weren't
               doing anything. I told her I saw them pushing each other and
               she said it was because some females in Einstein had started
               some stuff with her. Ofc. Westerman arrived and began speaking
               with the male. I asked her if she had ID and she said she
               wasn't going to show it to me and was going to leave. I advised
               her she was being detained and she began to pull away from me.
               I told her several times to stop resisting and she would stop
               and then start pulling away. I explained I was investigating a
               possible assault and I was detaining her. I told her several
               times to stop resisting and she continued. I pushed her into
               the cement pillar and held her there until she stopped. I then
               placed her in handcuffs and double locked the handcuffs. I told
               her she was not under arrest, but was just being detained. I
               asked her how old she was and she stated she was twenty three.
               I had her sit down on the steps and she complained about
               needing to pull her pants up. I assisted her with pulling her
               pants up and pulling her coat down over her butt. I then had
               her sit down. I told her several times why she was being
               detained and she continued to be argumentative. I asked her if
               she had identification and she said it was in her phone cover.
               I asked her if I could look at it and she said yes. I advised
               her of her Miranda Rights which she stated she understood. When
               I asked her if she wanted to talk to me she said, "not if it
               has something with nothing I did." I told her all I wanted to
               know was what happened tonight as I had observed them pushing
               each other as I pulled up. She said they had nothing to do with
               what I was doing right now. I again explained it to her and she

               said I had arrested her. I again explained she was not under
               arrest, but being detained. She was identified as Breann
               Martin. Due to her level of intoxication, she was not listening
               to what I was saying. She would say she understood she was
               being detained, but then would say I had arrested her. She then
               stated this was the first time she had seen him since 0000
               hours and he had just come out his dorm. I told her I just
               wanted to know about what I observed happening between the two
               of them when I pulled up. She said she wasn't threatened and he
               wasn't threatened. She said she wasn't assaulting him and he
               wasn't assaulting her. I spoke to Ofc. Westerman who stated the
               male had told him some girls had said something to Breann
               inside Einstein and she got mad. He said when I pulled up he
               had been trying to keep her from getting in a fight with the
               females. He said he had grabbed her and to stop her and that
               was when she shoved him. His story matched with what I had
               observed. I went back to Breann and told her it was my
               understanding that the two of them were not fighting with each
               other, but he was trying to prevent her from getting in a fight
               with the females and he said yes. She admitted they had been
               arguing earlier on the phone, but that was it. I asked her if
               she was hurt tonight and she said no. I tried to explain to her
               again why she was in handcuffs and she was not listening to
               what I was saying. I advised her at this time it was in her
               best interest to go home and stay there. I released her from
               the handcuffs and told her she was free to leave. She left. I
               then talked to the male and advised him she had gone home and
               it would be best for them not to talk tonight. He stated he
               understood and he went inside the residence hall. The females
               who were supposedly involved had left and we were unable to
               locate them. We cleared. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 19th day of February,
               2016, in Pullman, Washington.

               On 02-19-16 at approximately 0155 hours, I responded to
               Einstein Bagels reference a backpack which had been found. I
               contacted the RP who stated they had found the backpack in the
               sitting area and when they looked in it to try and find the
               owner, they found marijuana inside. I asked if they found id in
               the bag and she said no, she had stopped looking when she saw
               the drugs. I opened the bag and in the main compartment were
               two small plastic bags containing marijuana. There was also a
               pipe with burned residue in the bowl wrapped in two t-shirts.
               Next to the marijuana was a piece of paper from a Biology 107
               class which had the name Ian Nelson on it. I was able to find
               an Ian Nelson who resides in Northside Hall. Due to the time I
               decided I would attempt to contact Nelson later today to ask
               about the backpack. Nelson is under the age or twenty one. I
               returned to the station and placed the backpack in an evidence
               locker. More to follow. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 19th day of February,

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Boyd/335 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0830 SYNOPSIS: Report of a vehicle which
               had been unattended and running for approximately 8 hours. The
               owner was contacted and did not know why she left the vehicle
               running. The vehicle was turned off. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 02/19/16 at about 0320 hrs
               Dispatch advised of a report regarding a vehicle that was left
               running in the parking lot at Stephenson for approximately 8
               hours. I responded and located the vehicle, CA 7CMS987, a
               silver Nissan Altima. The vehicle was running with the lights
               on an all the doors locked. I noticed the vehicle was one with
               a push button start which only requires the key to be present
               to start the vehicle. It would be possible to walk away after
               driving the vehicle and forget to turn the vehicle off. I was
               able to locate the owner of the vehicle, Michelle L. Magee
               (122395), and contact her on the phone. When I spoke with her
               it was obvious she had been sleeping when I called. She told me
               she did not know why the vehicle was left running but she would
               go turn it off right away. I contacted Magee at her vehicle
               again to confirm everything was ok and she said it was. She
               told me she drove the vehicle earlier in the day but did not
               know why it was still running. She turned the vehicle off.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 19 day of February, 2016, in
