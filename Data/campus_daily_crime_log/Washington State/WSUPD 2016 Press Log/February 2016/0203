               arrested on an arrest warrant out of Colfax, WA. He was later
               booked into Whitman County Jail. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Vladimir Borisov (011484) Booked FTA/DWLS 3rd
               Degree Warrant 2. NARRATIVE: On 020316 at approximately 1245
               hours, I was contacted by WSUPD Records regarding a Vladimir
               Borisov who was on his way to the WSU Police Department to pick
               up his lost wallet. Records told me that Borisov had a warrant
               for his arrest out of Colfax listed in Spillman. I called
               Whitman County Jail and they confirmed that Borisov had a
               warrant for Failure to Appear on a suspended driving charge.
               Shortly after, our records staff contacted me and advised
               Borisov was at the WSU Police Department. I went to the lobby
               and contacted Borisov. I asked him if he was Vladimir and he
               told me he wasn't, he was just a friend who was there to pick
               up Vladimir's wallet. I explained to him I couldn't release
               Vladimir's wallet to anyone but Vladimir. He told me okay and
               left the office. I wasn't sure what Borisov looked like, so I
               checked the Cougar card picture in the wallet and noticed it
               was the same person who had just left the police department
               lobby. I ran to Terrell Mall outside the police department and
               contacted him again. I activated my VieVu body camera. I asked
               Borisov why he didn't tell me who he really was. He told me he
               thought something was up and got nervous. I explained to him
               that he had a warrant for his arrest and that he was under
               arrest. I handcuffed his wrists (DL), checked spacing and
               walked him to my patrol car. I searched him incident to arrest
               and placed him in the back seat of my patrol car. I transported
               him to Whitman County Jail. Dispatch later advised Borisov also
               had an arrest warrant out of Spokane County that was
               extraditable for FTA on a DWLS charge. At the jail I read him a
               copy of the arrest warrant out of Colfax. I told the jail staff
               that Borisov had a warrant out of Spokane County as well and
               they were faxing the warrant to the Whitman County Jail. Jail
               Sergeant Sam Keller told me he would take care of the warrant
               when it arrived. I took a photocopy of the Colfax warrant and
               provided Borisov with his wallet he had originally lost.
               Nothing Further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 2nd day of February, 2016, in

               Library parking garage. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               2. NARRATIVE: On 02/03/16 at approximately 2123 hours I was
               dispatched to a cold non-injury collision that occurred in the
               Holland Parking garage. I called the reporting party Jasmine A.
               Flores 08/24/94, who stated she had been in a collision. Flores
               said she was driving her roommate's car, WA/P289WSU 2000 VW
               Jetta, inside the Holland Parking garage. Flores stated she was
               going up the ramp to the upper part of the parking lot when a
               truck was turning onto the same ramp. Flores stated because of
               the tight turn the truck was taking, the truck was driving half
               in her lane and she ran into the truck. Flores stated her
               driver's side front quarter panel struck the truck's driver's
               side rear bumper. Flores said a male exited the truck and they
               both looked at the damage. Flores said they had agreed to
               exchange information but the male changed his mind and stated
               he would just fix his truck on his own. Flores said she was
               unsure what to do so she let the male go. Flores did not know
               who the driver was and only described the truck as a big white
               truck possibly a Chevrolet. When Flores got home she again
               looked at the damage and realized the amount of damage was
               greater than she first had imagined. Flores decided she needed
               to report the collision. I emailed Flores the State Patrol's
               citizen collision report and instructions how to complete it. I
               responded to Flores' residence and took pictures of the damage
               to her roommate's car. The damage was to the driver's side
               quarter panel above the wheel well. The bumper had also
               separated from the quarter panel due to the collision but did
               not look damaged. The majority of the quarter panel was dented
               and will need to be replaced. The driver's side mirror had also
               been damaged in the collision. The estimated value of damage to
               the Jetta is $800 dollars. Flores was provided with her case
               number and my business card. After I answered all of Flores'
               questions I cleared. END OF REPORT I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 4th day of
               February, 2016, in Pullman, Washington.

               call at Gannon Hall room 635. RED Ross McClure reported the

               from the door jamb of room 635. I knocked on the door several
               times. A male, later identified as Michael Gray, answered the
               door. I asked if he knew why I was there. He said he did not. I
               said I was there because someone reported the odor of marijuana
               coming from room 635. Gray's roommate was also in the room, I
               asked him to come to the door too. I asked if there was any
               marijuana in the room, Gray said there was "some". I asked him
               how old he was he said he was 19. I asked him if he had a

               Davis if he had any marijuana in the room, he said he did not.

               warning him for possession of marijuana and I would be
               forwarding my report to student conduct. I also told if he
               wanted he could collect the marijuana from the room and I would
               escort him to the dumpster and he could destroy the marijuana.
               Gray brought out a medicine bottle with about 2-3 grams of
               marijuana in it. We walked down to the dumpster and he opened
               the bottle and dump the marijuana out. I asked if he had any
