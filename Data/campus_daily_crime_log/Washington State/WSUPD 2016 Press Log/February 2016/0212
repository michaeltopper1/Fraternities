               the Chief Joseph Apartment parking lot near the B building.
               Upon arrival, I contacted Jacob Detwiler who told me the
               following. On 021116 at approximately 0910 hours, he parked his
               2013 Subaru Impreza in the parking lot outside the B building
               of Chief Joseph apartments. When he returned to his vehicle at
               approximately 0810 hours on 021216, he noticed an empty beer
               bottle on the ground near his vehicle and there was a circular
               dent in the hood of his car and several abrasions on the hood
               near the front windshield on the passenger side. Detwiler told
               me there are always people partying in the area, but doesn't
               have any specific suspect information for me. I took pictures
               of the damage to his vehicle and provided him with my business
               card with case number on it. No suspects or leads. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.

               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 02-12-2016 at
               about 1804 hrs I was dispatched to a report of a fraud at the
               Bookie, located at 1500 NE Terrell Mall. Dispatch advised that
               the Bookie had obtained a counterfeit bill. I arrived on scene
               and contacted Carolina N. Calvin (DOB 04-07-1994). Calvin is a
               manager for the Bookie. Calvin stated that on 02-08-2016
               between 1600 hrs and 2000 hrs the Bookie was selling books at a
               book fair located at the Museum of Anthropology inside College
               Hall. Calvin said during one of the transactions at the book
               fair, they obtained a counterfeit $20.00 bill. Calvin does not
               know what transaction contained the bill and does not have any
               suspect information. There was no video surveillance at the
               location of the book fair. Calvin provided me with the
               counterfeit bill. The serial number on the bill is:
               JB01390225B. I photographed the counterfeit bill, and the
               photographs were downloaded into Spillman and attached to this
               case. The counterfeit bill was logged into property as
               evidence. I forwarded the information in this case to the U.S.
               Secret Service. No suspects or leads were identified. No
               further action at this time. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare

               Poss of Marijuana 4. Mabel Hernandez Collazo/031297 Charges
               Forwarded Poss of Marijuana NARRATIVE: On 02/12/16 at about
               2310 hours I was walking back to my vehicle from a previous
               call. I was parked at the bottom of the blue lot near the
               Chinook Apartments. I noticed a vehicle parked three spaces
               over from my patrol vehicle that appeared to have people in it.
               The vehicle's windows were fogged up so it was difficult to
               determine how many people were inside. I noticed a red yellow
               glow come from inside the vehicle near the front seating area.
               It appeared to be someone smoking. I knocked on the passenger
               side front window and a female, later identified as Mabel
               Hernandez Collazo, rolled down the window. As the window rolled
               down I could see a cloud of smoke in the vehicle and could
               smell the odor of burnt marijuana. I asked the driver, later
               identified as Terah Whitehurst, and Hernandez Callazo how much
               marijuana was in the vehicle and they said they were not sure
               how much. I asked them both how old they were, they both said
               they were under 21. I asked if they had a medical marijuana
               card and they both said they did not. There were two males in
               the back seat of the vehicle, they were later identified as
               James Lawler(passenger side) and Aidan Mabry. I asked Mabry and
               Lawler the same questions and they both said they were under 21
               and did not have medical marijuana cards. I saw a plastic
               tackle box sitting on the center console arm rest. Everyone in
               the vehicle had direct access to the box. I asked if that was
               where the marijuana was and Whitehurst said it was. Sergeant
               Daniels was on scene at this time. I asked everyone to step out
               of the vehicle. I advised Whitehurst she could bring the tackle
               box if she would like, she brought it with her. I asked
               Whitehurst if the vehicle was hers, she said she was the
               registered owner. I asked if I could search the vehicle.
               Whitehurst said I could. I explained to Whitehurst she had the
               right to refuse the search, she had the right to stop the
               search at any point during the search and she had the right to
               restrict the area where I searched. Whitehurst said she

               understood and said I could search the vehicle. I searched the
               vehicle and found a glass pipe with burnt marijuana residue in
               it. It was located between the seat and the center console on
               the driver's side of the vehicle. I did not find anything else
               during my search. I asked Whitehurst if she could open the box
               that she had brought out of the vehicle. She opened it. Inside
               was a bag with green vegetable material(GVM) in it, and a glass
               bottle with GVM in it. I seized the pipe, the bag of GVM, and
               the bottle of GVM. I explained to all four that I would be
               forwarding charges of possession of marijuana to the Whitman
               County Prosecutor's office and forwarding my report to student
               conduct. I explained that since they had all been smoking they
               could not legally drive the vehicle. Whitehurst secured the
               vehicle and I told them they were free to go. I returned to the
               office and photographed and processed the evidence. I weighed
               and NIK tested the GVM in the bag. It weighed 2.49g and test
               presumptive positive for marijuana. The GVM from in the glass
               bottle weighed 2.04g. All three items were placed in evidence.
               Charges forwarded to Whitman County Prosecutor and report
               forwarded to student conduct. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               13th day of February, 2016, in Pullman, Washington.

               the area and found Susan Roberts sitting on the Chief Joseph
               Apartment sign near Merman Dr. Susan advised me he is a
               transgender male who prefers to be called Drew. I asked Drew
               what was going on and he stated he was just tired of it all and
               had too much to drink. He also stated he had thoughts of
               hurting himself. He stated he was hoping a vehicle would drive
               by going 50 mph so he could step out in front of it and it
               wouldn't be able to stop. I asked Drew if he wanted to go to
               the hospital, and he stated he didn't know. I advised Drew
               based on what he had told me, he could go voluntarily, or I
               could make the decision for him and take him into protective
               custody. Drew stated he would go voluntarily. I patted him down
               and walked him to my vehicle. Drew was placed in the rear seat
               and I transported him to Pullman Regional Hospital. While en
               route to the hospital Drew and I talked. Drew stated he is
               working on his Master's and has his thesis due soon. He stated
               he is stressed out and talked about several issues he was
               currently having, from financial issues to emotional and
               mental. Drew also stated he had just come out as trans and was
               dealing with issues surrounding the decision. When we arrived
               at PRH, I assisted in getting Drew checked in. I advised him to
               call if he needed any further help, and he stated he would. I
               provided information to the hospital staff and I cleared. I
               later sent an email to WSU Counseling Services and placed a
               copy in Files. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury

               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               02/13/16 at about 0152 hours there was a report of loud
               motorcycles in the area of Regents Hall. Officer searched the
               area and were unable to locate. The reporting party called
               again at about 0215 hours and reported hearing them again. I
               responded and talked to two males Tavarse Martin and Isaiah
               Johnson in the bicycle locker area of Northside dorms. Martin
               and Johnson had just placed two small dirt type motorcycles in
               the locker area. Neither bike had a license plate or
               registration. I explained to Martin and Johnson they were not
               allow to drive the motorcycles on the roadways unless they had
               them registered in the state of Washington. I explained they
               may need to make modifications to the motorcycles to make them
               street legal and they would need to have motorcycle
               endorsements on their driver's licenses as well. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 13th day of February, 2016, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer
