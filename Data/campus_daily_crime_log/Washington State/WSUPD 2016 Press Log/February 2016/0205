               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0580 SYNOPSIS: Report that an unknown
               person threw something baseball sized off the pedestrian bridge
               Between Wegner and Troy Hall on a vehicle. No suspects.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 020516
               at approximately 1052 hours, I was dispatched to contact Walker
               C. Ward regarding a malicious mischief report. Upon contact,
               Ward told me the following. On 020416 at approximately 1154
               hours, he was driving his 1999 Toyota SB on Stadium Way under
               the foot bridge that goes between Troy Hall and Wegner Hall. As
               he passed under the bridge, someone threw something hard and it
               hit his front windshield. Ward told me he wasn't sure what hit
               his vehicle, but thought it was about the size of a baseball.
               He explained that the front window has a large crack in it. I
               asked him to send me a picture of the damage and he told me he
               would. Ward told me he didn't stop driving, and he has no idea
               who may have thrown the item off the bridge. Ward asked me to
               check video surveillance cameras in the area, and I advised him
               we didn't currently have any in that area. I estimated the
               value of a new windshield at $700.00. Case inactive pending
               further leads. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 5th day of February, 2016, in

               Eric R. Foster 04/25/75 Counseled Citizen Dispute 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 02/05/16 at approximately 1618 hours I responded to the
               report of a WSU Parking Services parking attendant being
               harassed by someone he issued a ticket to. Upon arrival I found
               Jonathan D. Hoefs 09/13/86 standing near a 2002 Jeep Wrangler.
               Hoefs works for WSU Parking Services. Next to Hoefs was Eric R.
               Foster 04/25/75 who was talking on his cell phone. I asked
               Hoefs what was going on and Hoefs stated he issued the Wrangler
               a parking citation for not properly displaying a parking permit
               when the Wrangler's owner, Foster, confronted him about it.
               Hoefs stated Foster was yelling at him and demanded for Hoefs
               name and contact information. Hoefs also stated that Foster was
               video taping the incident. Hoefs said Foster did not threaten
               him or touch him. Ofc. Petlovany spoke to an eye witness,
               Samuel D. Anagnostou 04/23/94, who stated Foster was in Hoefs
               face yelling aggressively. Anagnostou said Foster never touched
               Hoefs however Anagnostou said Foster was clearly "harassing"
               Hoefs. Foster was still on his cell phone and I was able to
               determine that he was talking to Parking Services. Once Foster
               was off the phone I asked him what his side of the story was.
               Foster stated that he had a parking permit in his window but
               the parking attendant said he could not see the expiration date
               on it. I looked at the parking permit and the paper temporary
               permit was placed up against the front window on the dash. The
               expiration date was covered up by the lower section of the
               dash. The parking permit clearly states that the temporary
               permit must be hung from the rear view mirror. Foster stated he
               is tired of getting tickets even when he does nothing wrong. I
               told Foster that I understood he recorded his interaction with
               Hoefs. I asked Foster if we could watch the video together so I
               could get a better understanding of their interaction. Foster
               told me I could not see the video because it was his. It was
               clear that Foster did not want me to see the video because it
               would paint him in a poor light. I told Foster that if he would
               like to file a complaint about the parking attendant he could
               do so at WSU Parking Services. I also told Foster that there
               were witnesses to Hoefs and his interaction. I told Foster that
               it sounded like he was behaving inappropriately and let his
               emotions get out of hand. Foster was in his PAC 12 media
               clothing since he was working at Beasley for the upcoming

               Women's basketball game. I told Foster that it would not
               reflect well on him if he was seen behaving the way he did
               while at work. Since Foster had already talked to Parking
               Services he knew the next steps to contesting his parking
               citation. I asked Foster if there was any questions I could
               answer for him and Foster said no. I told Foster he was free to
               go and I cleared. I responded to WSU Parking Services and spoke
               with Damen Rodriguez about the situation. Rodriguez was already
               aware of the situation and I provided him with the case number.
               Rodriguez said he did not need anything else from me and I
               cleared. END OF REPORT I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 5th day of February,

               NARRATIVE: On 02-05-2016 at about 1710 hrs I was dispatched to
               a report of a suspicious person at Goldsworthy Hall, located at
               1457 SE Stadium Way. I arrived on scene and contacted the
               complainant, Brittney D. Ramirez (DOB 06-02-1994). Ramirez was
               working at the front desk in the main lobby of Goldsworthy
               hall. Ramirez said a few minutes ago she had observed a
               suspicious person dressed in a full body, spandex suit walking
               around the main lobby of Goldsworthy Hall. Ramirez said she
               believed the person was wearing a "slender man" costume, which
               also covered the person's face. Ramirez said the person was
               acting strange and had bothered someone studying in the lobby,
               so she decided to call the police department. Ramirez said she
               last saw the person walking into Goldsworthy Hall. I walked

               approximately 2025 hours Ofc. Westerman was dispatched to a
               Welfare Check. I proceeded to check the subjects room at Perham
               and confirmed he (Hunter S. Kronberg 100296) was not there. I
               then called the RP, Hunter's mother, Rachel E. Kronberg. She
               had expected him home about 2-3 hours before. She had no reason
               to believe he would harm himself and had no leads. Rachel said
               her husband Phillip was on his way to Pullman, tracing the
               route their son would have taken. She gave me his phone number.
               Ofc. Westerman checked the area for a possible vehicle. I
               contacted Phillip and linked up with him at Perham Hall when
               dispatch informed us they had gained some information. I called
               dispatch and was informed Hunter had been arrested for DUI in
               Colfax earlier in the day. I informed the obviously distressed
               Phillip of what I knew and directed him to the Whitman County
               Jail. I cleared. Nothing follows. I certify and declare under

               Exhibiting 2. NARRATIVE: On 02/06/16 at about 0008 hrs I was
               driving westbound on Colorado St. approaching B St. when I
               noticed a male and female walking eastbound along Colorado St.
               They caught my attention because the female, later identified
               as Joelle M. Antilla (082496), appeared to be under 21 and was
               having great difficulty walking. She was stumbling side to side
               and her head was wobbling from side to side as she walked. She
               was using the male, who was not identified, for balance as she
               walked. I observed Antilla stumble and almost fall down as they
               were walking. I went around the block and saw as they crossed
               the intersection of Thatuna Rd. and Colorado St. as they walked
               up on the sidewalk after crossing the street Antilla again
               stumbled and almost fell. I turned on to Colorado St. and
               contacted Antilla along Colorado St. across from D. St. As I
               exited my car Antilla was leaning against a large concrete
               retaining wall for balance. She almost fell forward as she was
               leaning against the wall but was caught by her male companion.
               As I approached they started to walk off. I asked Antilla how
               much she had to drink and said I was concerned by how
               intoxicated she was. She said she was fine and I told her she
               needed to stop and speak with me. Antilla stopped and I asked
               how old she was and she said 19. I asked if she had ID with her
               and she said no. She provided me with her name and date of
               birth, which I confirmed through Dispatch. I asked Antilla if I
               could check her eyes so I could see how much she had to drink.
               She agreed and I had her step away from the wall. I attempted
               to administer a horizontal gaze nystagmus but she was unable to
               maintain her balance long enough to perform the test. I could
               smell the odor of intoxicants on her breath as I spoke with
               her. Antilla spoke with slurred speech and had bloodshot and
               watery eyes. I asked if she would be willing to submit to a
               breath sample and Antilla agreed. She provided a sample of .201
               on Alco-Sensor FST #5493. Antilla said her friend was taking
               her home. I explained I was concerned with how intoxicated she
               was and that she should not be alone. The male friend who was
               with her agreed to stay with her until Antilla's roommate
               returned home. I spoke to Antilla's roommate on the phone and
               confirmed she was going to be home in approximately 30 minutes.
               I advised Antilla she was free to go. As she was walking away I

               Exhibiting 2. NARRATIVE: On 02/06/16 at about 0034 hrs I was
               driving eastbound on Campus St. near Community Duncan Dunn Hall
               when I noticed a group of three people walking eastbound along
               Campus St. They caught my attention because one of the females,
               later identified as Sydney D. Spencer (043097), appeared to be
               under the age of 21 and was having great difficulty walking.
               She was being assisted by the other two people and was still
               stumbling side to side as she walked. Her head flopped to the
               side every time she stumbled. I stopped and contacted Spencer
               near Wilmer Hall. I told her I was concerned with how much she
               had to drink and she said, "no I'm good". She admitted to
               having 4-5 drinks but could not say what they were. At this
               point I was concerned Spencer may fall over and asked one of
               her friends, who were not identified, to hold on to her to make
               sure she did not fall. Spencer's clothes were dirty, as if she
               already fell down at least one time. She also had mucus hanging
               from her nose down onto her upper lip and her hair was very
               disheveled. I asked if she had any ID with her and she said no.
               She provided me with her name and date of birth, which
               confirmed she was under 21. The information provided was
               confirmed through Dispatch. I asked if I could check her eyes
               to see how much she had to drink and Spencer agreed. I
               attempted to administer a horizontal gaze nystagmus test on her
               but she could not follow my pen long enough to perform the
               test. I observed she had bloodshot and watery eyes. I could
               smell a strong odor of intoxicants on her breath as I spoke to
               her. I asked her friends where they were taking her. They
               advised her roommate was meeting them at Wilmer Hall to take
               her back to the room. I advised Spencer I would be forwarding
               charged to the Whitman County prosecutors office and she was
               released to her sober roommate, who was not identified. Nothing

               trespassing in an employees area of Flix Cafe. The subject was
               warned for trespassing and removed from the building. His
               backpack was later located and found by Flix staff to contain

               hrs Dispatch advised staff at Flix Cafe was reporting a subject
               who was claiming to be an employee trespassing in the employee
               only area of the building. He was not an employee and the
               manager had him in the manager's office. I responded and was
               directed to the southside cafe manager's office where the
               suspect was. I recognized the suspect as Bradley J. Stipek
               (040897) from a previous case where he was involved. Stipek
               appeared to have been consuming alcohol but was not intoxicated
               to the point where I felt enforcement was necessary. Stipek
               refused to tell me why he was trespassing in the employees only
               area of the building. The manager advised he just wanted Stipek
               removed. I warned Stipek for criminal trespass and advised him
               if he was caught trespassing again he would be arrested. I
               escorted Stipek out of the building. A short time later I was
               called back by staff because they located a backpack in the
               Flix manager's office, which was one of the areas Stipek had
               been seen trespassing. They were going through the backpack to
               find an owner when they located what they believed to be drugs
               in an asprin container. The drugs were described as a white
               powder in several small baggies. They said they also found
               Stipek's cougar card in the same backpack pocket. I took
               possession of the backpack and transported it back to the
               station. I removed four small plastic bags with a white powder
               in each one. One of the bags was marked with an "H" in sharpie.
               The contents of one bag was NIK tested and showed a presumptive
               positive test for Cocaine. I inventoried the rest of the
               contents of the backpack, which was a black Skullcandy
               backpack. It contained Stipek's cougar card, a book titled "the
               great depression", mamba sour candies, a bic lighter,

               two Bic lighters, a black&mild cigar, and $0.18. The bags
               containing cocaine were seized as evidence and the remaining
               items logged as found property. As I was logging the
               evidence/found property we received a report of a subject
               acting strangely and trespassing in Gannon Hall. The suspect
               was believed to be Stipek. See case #16-W0597 for further
               regarding that report. I attempted to contact Stipek at his
               room and on the phone but was unable to do so. I left a message
               for him advising him his backpack was found in Flix and I would
               like to return it to him. I will be attempting to contact
               Stipek at another time. More to follow. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               06 day of February, 2016, in Pullman, Washington.

    Narrative: RVWD:MJG/309 / OFC: Olmstead/339 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY
               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0595 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched
               to a report of a theft at Orton Hall. The complainant reported
               that his WSU Cougar Card Maxx was stolen. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 02-06-2016 at about
               0133 hrs I was dispatched to a report of a theft at Orton Hall,
               located at 1475 SE Olympia Avenue. I arrived on scene and
               contacted Jenafer L. Doolittle (DOB 07-09-1988) and Parth O.
               Chandak (DOB 01-02-1996). Doolittle is the hall director for
               Orton Hall, and Chandak is the resident advisor for the 9th
               floor of Orton Hall. Chandak reported that on 02-05-2016 at
               about 2030 hrs he was in the Orton Hall lobby and had his WSU
               Cougar Card Maxx with him. Chandak's student identification
               number is: 011440915. Later that same day at about 2130 hrs
               Chandak went to the Student Recreation Center (SRC) and
               discovered that his Cougar Card Maxx was missing from his pant
               pocket. Chandak was not sure where he lost the card but
               speculated that he could have lost it in Orton Hall or on the
               way to the SRC. The value of the card was determined to be
               $15.00. The Cougar Card Maxx is a student identification card
               and debit card. The card can be swiped at card readers posted
               at the doors in residence halls to grant access. The card can
               be used to purchase food and other items on campus and is
               linked to the student's residence dining account. The card is
               also linked to the student's bank account and can be used as a
               debit card. Doolittle said that on 02-06-2016 at about 0130 hrs
               she was in the hall director's office in Orton Hall. She heard
               someone outside the door and heard the person swipe a card to
               open the door. The door opened, and Doolittle saw an
               unidentified male standing in the doorway. Doolittle did not
               recognize the male, and the male proceeded to run out of the
               building through the main entrance doors. Doolittle said the
               male ran down the sidewalk and towards the "blue #1" parking
               lot. Doolittle described the male as: white male; college age;
               short brown hair; blue jeans; fleece camo jacket; and tan in
               color beanie hat. Doolittle did not recognize the male and
               could not provide any further descriptive details. Because
               Doolittle did not recognize the male, she returned to her
               office and looked up the card swipe information for the hall
               director's office door. Doolittle discovered that the
               unidentified male had used Chandak's Cougar Card at 0127 hrs to
               open the office door. Doolittle then contacted Chandak, and
               they checked the card swipe history for his Cougar Card. They
               discovered that in addition to being used at 0127 hrs to enter

               Doolittle printed out the card swipe history for Chandak's
               Cougar Card and provided it to me. The document was scanned,
               downloaded into Spillman, and attached to this case. Doolittle
               said nothing was missing from the hall director's office and
               nothing appeared to be out of place. Doolittle checked the
               general card swipe activity for Orton Hall around the time
               Chandak's Cougar Card was being used but nothing of interest
               was identified. While I was speaking with Doolittle, Sergeant
               Daniels and Officer Boyd searched the area for the suspect, but
               the suspect was not located. Doolittle advised that she had
               locked Chandak's Cougar Card so it could no longer be used to
               gain access to Orton Hall. Doolittle said she would contact the
               police department if she observed the suspect in the building
               again. Chandak checked his residence dining account and bank
               account records and advised that he did not find any
               unauthorized transactions. Chandak said he would take the
               appropriate steps to cancel his Cougar Card and would contact
               me if he identified any charges on his accounts. No further
               action at this time, pending additional suspect information.

               at approximately 0150 hours, I was driving through the parking
               lot behind Rogers Hall when I observed the odor of marijuana. I
               observed two males in the lower lot of Stephenson Parking Lot,
               walk to the fence of Yakama Apts and jump over the fence. After
               watching them leave the area, I drove down to where I had first
               seen them walking. As I approached the area, I watched five
               people quickly get out of a parked vehicle. As I got closer to
               the vehicle, I observed the odor of marijuana became stronger.
               I parked my vehicle and got out and asked who own the car as
               the subjects began walking towards Stephenson Complex. I
               activated my VieView camera, but soon realized the camera was
               dead and did not record my contact. One of the males, later
               identified as Matthew D. Topaz, stated the vehicle was his and
               he walked back to my location. I noticed as I stood in front of
               the car, I could still smell a strong odor of marijuana even
               though the wind was blowing fairly hard. I asked him who had
               the marijuana and he began to say something and then stopped. I
               watched him bend his head down, look at the others walking
               away, and then he stated, "I don't have it". I then asked the
               others to stop and come speak with me. They all began walking
               back towards me, and as they approached, I watched one of the
               females, later identified as Stefani A. Williams, bend down at
               the rear passenger tire of the truck parked next to the car and
               drop something. I asked her what she just dropped and she said
               nothing. I walked towards the truck and could see a plastic bag
               in the exact spot she had dropped something. I picked it up and
               observed it was a plastic bag containing marijuana and there
               was also a metal grinder. I walked back to her location and
               asked her how old she was and she stated 18. I asked her if she
               was a medical marijuana patient and she said no, and began
               crying. I asked the group for their identification and they all
               had Cougar Cards or a driver's license except for Cooper S.
               Knowles. The others were identified as Colin L. Coker and Mary
               M. O'Neal. I asked the group if any of them were 21 and they
               all said no. I asked if any of them were medical marijuana

               patients and they all said no. I asked if they were all smoking
               in the car and Matthew said yes. While speaking with them, I
               watched Colin bend down and pretend to tie his right shoe lace.
               He then switched to his left foot and I watched him hesitate,
               start to reach for his back pocket, and look around like he was
               looking to trying to find a place to drop something. I asked
               him what he was doing and he said just tying his shoe. I told
               him I found it odd he untied them first to retie them and I
               asked if he was trying to toss something and he stated he
               wouldn't do that. He then stated he had marijuana in his back
               pocket and would give it to me. He handed me a black plastic
               container which had a plastic bag of marijuana, two glass pipes
               with burned residue in the bowls, and a lighter. I advised the
               five I would be forwarding the incident with their names to
               Student Conduct. I advised them I would not be arresting them
               for the marijuana and explained the marijuana laws to them. I
               looked in the car and could not see any other items. I asked
               them if they had anything else and they stated no. I asked them
               if they had any questions and they said no. I advised them they
               were free to leave and the left. I returned to the station and
               placed the items seized into evidence for destruction. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0597 SYNOPSIS: Report of a subject
               acting strangely in Gannon Hall and trespassing in people's
               rooms. I was unable to locate the suspect at the time. This is
               related to another case (16-W0593). NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Bradley J. Stipek/040897 Trespassing 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 02/06/16 at a bout 0157 hrs Dispatch advised of a
               report regarding a subject who was acting suspiciously and
               trespassing in people's rooms in Gannon Hall on the 5th floor.
               The suspect was believed to be Bradley J. Stipek (040897), who
               was involved in a similar case earlier in the evening (see case
               #16-W0593). Dispatch advised Stipek had already been escorted
               from the building by hall staff. I responded to Gannon Hall and
               checked the stairwell inside and outside the building as well
               as the immediate area surrounding the building. I did not see
               Stipek in the area. I contacted the complainant, Logan T.
               Pruitt (090696), on the phone. He told me he was contacted by
               residents because an individual followed them into the building
               and then into their room, closing the door behind him. He was
               acting very strangely just starring and not speaking at all.
               The eventually got him into the hallway where several residents
               were trying to speak with him when hall staff arrived. Pruitt
               spoke to Stipek and was able to determine he did not live in
               the building and needed to be escorted out. Pruitt said he and
               several of the residents were concerned Stipek might be under
               the influence of some sort of drugs based on his strange
               behavior. Pruitt told me he believed the suspects last name was
               Stipek and he lived in Stephenson South. He provided me with a
               physical description which matched what I know Stipek to look
               like. Pruitt told me he spoke to the residents and none of them
               desired to press charges for trespassing. I attempted to
               contact Stipek on the phone and at his residence but was unable
               to find him. I will be making contact with him regarding the
               previous incident (16-W0593) and will warn him for trespassing
               in this case at that time. More to follow I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               06 day of February, 2016, in Pullman, Washington.
