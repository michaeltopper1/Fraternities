               on gravel shoulder of road injuring her right ankle. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On February 16,
               2016 at about 0834 hours WSU Police and Pullman Fire were
               dispatched to a female who fell and broke her ankle in the area
               of a brown building near the WSU Alumni Center parking lot. I
               responded to the area. I located the patient on Ellis Way about
               100 north of the Wilson Road intersection. The patient was
               lying on the west gravel shoulder of Ellis Way. There was a
               group of people surround the patient. They were holding her
               right leg. As I exited my patrol vehicle I was approached by a
               male who was on a cell phone with 911. He told me that the lady
               on the phone (911 dispatcher) did not know where Ellis Way was
               and he was very concerned. I assured him that the ambulance was
               enroute to our location. I later learned the male was the
               husband of the patient. When I approached the patient I could
               see her right ankle was hanging from her leg. It was obvious
               that the ankle was injured. She complained of right leg and
               ankle pain. The patient and husband complained about how long
               it took for an ambulance to arrive on scene. I repeatedly told
               them that they were enroute to our location. Pullman Fire
               personnel arrived on scene approximately eleven (11) minutes
               after they were paged. I assisted Pullman Fire personnel with
               treating and extricating the patient from the shoulder of the
               road. The patient was transported by ambulance to Pullman
               Regional Hospital. I later learned from the husband that his
               family was here to visit campus from the Seattle area. His son
               had an appointment with FSHN for a tour. A representative from
               FSHN was on scene and took the son on a tour. I provided
               driving instructions to the hospital for the husband. He went
               on to tell me that his wife slipped on the gravel slope. He
               said when her foot caught on the grass her ankle was injured.
               There was no approved walkway where the incident took place. I
               photographed the scene. It is a steep slope on this portion of
               shoulder covered in gravel. It is not indented for pedestrian
               use. No further investigation. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 16th day of
               February, 2016, in Pullman, Washington.

               assaulted by his roommate during an argument over the electric
               bill. Investigation continues NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Devan E. Boucher (071496) 2. NARRATIVE: On
               021616 at approximately 1426 hours, I was dispatched to the
               lobby of the WSU Police Department for an assault report. Upon
               arrvial, I contacted Joshua K. Hames who told me the following.
               Since the beginning of August 2015, Devan E. Boucher, Joseph
               Schultz and Hames were all cohabitating in their apartment.
               Boucher agreed to have the electric bill pulled from his
               account on a monthly basis, and Schultz and Hames had agreed to
               pay one third each which came to $34.40 monthly. Over the past
               month, Schultz had been staying at his girlfriends apartment
               and stopped paying his portion of the electric bill. At
               approximately 1300 hours, Boucher approached Hames and told him
               that since Schultz was not paying his third, he wanted Hames to
               pay $51.60 monthly because Schultz was not paying his portion
               of the bill. Hames refused to pay Schultz portion of the bill.
               They continued arguing for a few minutes and Boucher left the
               apartment. At approximately 1315 hours, Boucher returned and
               told Hames that he needed to pay the $51.60 regardless of if he
               gets any money from Schultz. Hames refused to pay Schultz
               portion again. Boucher got upset and grabbed Hames by his right
               wrist and t-shirt and began shaking him. Boucher was yelling
               and swearing at Hames. Hames told me he was in fear of his
               safety and thought Boucher might hit him. Hames told me after
               Boucher grabbed him, he kicked the heater vent and knocked the
               doorbell off the door as he slammed the door leaving the
               apartment. I asked Hames if his wrist hurt when he was grabbed
               and he told me it was sore afterwards. He told me he didn't
               have any marks or injuries from the assualt, but he didn't want
               to be around Boucher anymore because he fears the problem will
               get worse. Hames told me he was working with WSU Housing on
               relocating as soon as possible. I attempted contacting Boucher
               via cell phone and was unsuccessful. I went to his residence
               and he was not home. I went to his girlfriend's house at E26
               and nobody answered the door. Investigation continues. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 17th day of February, 2016, in Pullman,

               stopped in Royal City by a police officer she believed was an
               impersonator. She reported the situation to WSP who is
               investigating the case, but wanted us to be aware because the
               subject has her campus address. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 021616 at approximately 1509
               hours, I was dispatched to contact Eden A. Kelshaw in the WSUPD
               lobby regarding an informational report. Upon contact, Kelshaw
               told me the following. Earlier on 021616 she was driving from
               the Seattle area to Pullman via SR 26 when she was stopped in
               the area of Royal City. She told me a male officer named Parker
               approached and asked for her license, registration and proof of
               insurance which she provided. He went back to his vehicle for
               several minutes, and returned he ordered to get out of her car.
               She inquired why she was stopped and why he needed her to get
               out of the vehicle and he refused to tell her. She asked for
               his name and badge number and he refused to provide that
               information. She stated she rolled the window up to where there
               was only a crack to commuicate. She told me he tried to open
               her door and she locked it. She stated she dialed 911 and the
               officer returned her license, registration and insurance and
               went back to his car. She told me he turned off his lights and
               made an immediate U turn driving away in the Westbound
               direction. Kelshaw described the patrol car as a white SUV
               similar to WSP's patrol cars. She thought the lights were dash
               lights inside the car and not mounted on the roof. She
               described the officer as 6 feet tall, stocky build with blonde
               hair. He was wearing a black uniform with a black gun belt on.
               She told me she didn't see what patches were on his shoulders.
               Kelshaw told me she reported the incident to WSP and they
               confirmed that they were not the agency who stopped her. She
               also told me WSP confirmed there were no other local agencies
               with an officer Parker working in that area. Kelshaw stated she
               is concerned the officer has her local address in Nez Perce K43
               because it was on her registration. I contacted Sgt. Shawley
               with WSP in Whitman County and inquired if he had received any
               information on an impersonator. He told me he hadn't but would
               contact WSP Sergeants in the area of Royal City and see what he
               could find out for me. Investigation continues. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               17th day of February, 2016, in Pullman, Washington.

               check. Subject transported to PRH. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Henderson, Kevin (06/23/97) Protective Custody
               2. NARRATIVE: On 02/16/16 around 2031 hrs I was dispatched to a
               request for a welfare check on and individual, later identified
               as Kevin Henderson (06/23/97), who lives in room 1121 of
               Stephenson North. Whitcom went on to tell me Henderson had left
               a suicide note and the complainant, later identified as Sean D
               McGaughey (06/12/96), could not reach him. I went to Stephenson
               North, while Ofc Westerman began to search the area for
               Henderson. Upon my arrival I contacted McGaughey and was told
               he believed this had started over a conversation over a
               roommate situation next year. He continued and explained
               Henderson believed they would be living together next year.
               McGaughey explained he was planning on living with his brother
               and believed that was the end of the conversation. When
               McGaughey returned to his room around 2034 hrs he found a note
               written by Henderson (SEE FILES), which I later took, in which
               he indicated his intent to take his own life. McGaughey showed
               me the note and told me last he knew Henderson was going to
               Dutch Brothers in Moscow. I read the note which said "I'm
               really sorry but I just can't take it anymore. I have to end it
               while I still can. I just can't take anymore pain." The note
               continues and he says "I will end tomorrow probably at midnight
               tonight or sometime thurs morning. I'll send the letters I made
               for everybody right before but I just can't take this pain
               anymore." As I was reading the note McGaughey was receiving
               instant messages from Henderson, who said he was heading out of
               cell phone range soon. Westerman went to Stadium Way near Grand
               Ave to try and locate Henderson's vehicle (Wa. AKW5046), which
               Whitcom had located, while I remained with McGaughey. McGaughey
               tried to convince Henderson to come and speak with him, but
               Henderson was refusing. The text messages continued with
               Henderson for a short period of time, during which Resident
               Advisor Bashir A Hussein (02/05/95) was made aware of the
               current situation. A short time later Westerman advised he had
               located Henderson's vehicle near Bishop Blvd. He later stopped
               the vehicle on East Main St near Bishop Blvd and I headed that
               way. Upon my arrival I found Westerman speaking with Henderson
               outside of the vehicle and as I approached I activated my Vie
               Vu camera. We spoke for a short period of time during which he
               admitted to having written the note. He denied having any
               intention of harming himself and after a brief conversation

               about this I told him I did not believe what he was telling me.
               I went on and asked how he planned to end his life at which
               point he paused and told us he had not thought about that part.
               We continued to speak for a brief period before I asked him if
               he was willing to go and speak with someone tonight. Henderson
               did not want to speak with anyone tonight, telling us he just
               wanted to return home for the night. At this point I placed him
               in protective custody and placed him in handcuffs, which were
               double locked, before searching him and transporting him to
               Pullman Regional Hospital. Upon our arrival at Pullman Regional
               Hospital I deactivated my camera and he was checked in for
               further evaluation. I completed the necessary paperwork and
               provided a copy of the note Henderson had written to medical
               personnel before explaining what we had learned. I cleared a
               short time later and returned to the WSU Police Department
               where I completed this case and downloaded the note and video
               to this case. I later placed the Protective Custody form and
               note in the records box to later be added to this case. Around
               0006 hrs I received a phone call from Dr Geiger regarding this
               case. She told me after speaking with Henderson she felt
               comfortable in releasing him and we briefly discussed what I
               had learned. After speaking with Geiger I contacted Hall Staff
               for Stephenson North and let them know of his release. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 17th day of February, 2016, in Pullman,

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0787 SYNOPSIS: Subject reporting an ex-
               boyfriend violated a protection order at the SRC. This case
               will be referred to the prosecutor. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE 1.
               Faisal F.A.A. Alqudairi 01/10/90 Prosecutor Notified Violate
               Order 2. NARRATIVE: On 02/16/16 at approximately 2046 hours I
               was dispatched to a violate order call that had occurred at the
               SRC. I met the reporting party LuJain A.M. Alaali 01/08/94, at
               her apartment 2290 NE Westwood Dr, apt U203. Alaali stated she
               has a protection order against her ex-boyfriend, Faisal F.A.A.
               Alqudairi 01/10/90. Alaali stated she went to the SRC to work
               out around 2000 hours. When driving through the parking lot she
               noticed Alqudairi's car in the parking lot. Alaali decided to
               go and work out even though she knew that Alqudairi was most
               likely inside. When Alaali entered the SRC she noticed
               Alqudairi working out in the weight area on the first floor.
               Alaali went to the second floor to use an elliptical machine. A
               while later Alqudairi walked to the upstairs, walked past
               Alaali, and began to use a machine. Alaali stated Alqudairi was
               looking at her so she said loudly to her friend, something to
               the effect of, "if he (Alqudairi) does not leave soon I'm going
               to call the Police." Alaali said Alqudairi got up and left the
               building a few minutes after her statement. I read over
               Alaali's protection order prior to contacting her. The order
               states, "SHALL N0T SEEK 0UT PET WHILE AT WSU/SHALL HAVE N0
               INTENTI0NAL C0NTACT/IS PR0HIB FR0M C0MING WITHIN 300FT 0F PETS
               H0ME & WITHIN 50FT 0F PET." I asked Alaali how close Alqudairi
               walked near her. Alaali said Alqudairi came within
               approximately 30 feet of her. Alaali said Alqudairi did not say
               anything to her but did look at her when he was working out.
               Alaali said this is an ongoing issue. I told Alaali that I
               would contact Alqudairi and figure out what was going on. I
               called Alqudairi and left a message on his voicemail. Alqudairi
               returned my call and I asked if we could meet up. Alqudairi
               stated he was in Moscow so I interviewed him over the phone. I
               asked Alqudairi what happened today at the SRC. Alqudairi
               stated he was working out downstairs when Alaali came into the
               SRC. Alqudairi stated that Alaali went upstairs to work out and
               that was it there was no issue. I told Alqudairi that I had
               been told he went upstairs to use a machine. Alqudairi said yes
               he did and walked by Alaali however Alqudairi said Alaali was
               the one who came over to him. Alqudairi stated that Alaali
               walked past his backside but no words were exchanged. Alqudairi
               said that was the entire contact. Alqudairi kept expressing his

               frustration with Alaali continuing to show up where he is and
               calling in that he violated the no contact order. Alaali went
               on to say that Alaali got him expelled from school so he now
               attends the University of Idaho in Moscow, ID. Alqudairi said
               he started at U of I in January. I asked Alqudairi if he is no
               longer a student at WSU why was he using the WSU Student Rec
               Center? Alqudairi said he still lives in Pullman so it is
               closer. I told Alqudairi that unless he is a paying member or
               current WSU student then he should be using the U of I Rec
               Center. Alqudairi also expressed his frustration with the fact
               that Alaali can contact him without and not get in trouble but
               if he does he will be in trouble. I explained how protection
               orders work and told him how he could apply for a protection
               order against Alaali. I urged Alqudairi to leave the area if he
               saw Alaali. Alqudairi responded that he did not want to be a
               "chicken" and always having to run away. I told Alqudairi that
               he needed to do anything in his power to prevent him being
               around Alaali. Charges of violation of a no contact order will
               be forwarded to the prosecutor as discretion only. END OF

               dispatched to a report of the odor of marijuana coming from
               room 319 of Goldsworthy Hall. Upon my arrival I walked up to
               the door and noticed the lights were not on inside of the room
               as I looked through the peep hole in the door. I smelled around
               the crack of the door and noticed the odor of what I believed
               to be marijuana coming from inside of the room and knocked on
               the door. I heard no movement from within the room and after
               knocking several times spoke with the complainant, later
               identified as Joshua B McPhatter (06/24/89). I explained to

               residents of the room and was told they haven't been a problem
               up to this point. I asked them to keep an eye on it and to
               speak with the residents when they had a chance, which they
               said they would do before I cleared. Nothing further. I certify

               Jacox 06/23/95 Warned Harassment 2. NARRATIVE: On 02/16/16 at
               approximately 2236 hours I was dispatched to a harassment call
               at Coman Hall room 317. Upon arrival I met with Raven E. Savage
               02/10/97 who was reporting Julian Paul Jacox 06/23/95 was
               harassing her. Raven and her twin sister Nya W. Savage 02/10/97
               were both present in their room during the interview. Raven
               said since around the beginning of January, Jacox has been
               sending her facebook messages. Raven thought it was odd since
               she had never met Jacox. Raven said today at approximately 2215
               hours she was at Einstein Bagels in Global Scholars Hall
               sitting at a table when Jacox walked up to her and leaned over
               her from behind. Jacox started to talk to Raven asking personal
               questions such as about her boyfriend. Jacox also took Raven's
               phone momentarily as if he was looking for her cell phone
               number. Raven stated she has been a victim of stalking in the
               past and became very uncomfortable. Raven became so
               uncomfortable that when Jacox turned his back to her Raven ran
               out of the bagel shop and ran to her dorm room. Raven called
               her sister Nya and Nya came back to their room and that's when
               they called 911. Raven showed me the facebook conversation with
               Jacox. The conversation was light hearted and it appeared as if
               Jacox was trying to flirt with Raven. Raven several times told
               Jacox that she did not know him. Raven kept referring to Jacox
               that she had a boyfriend but Jacox did not appear to get the
               hint. At no point in the conversation did Raven tell Jacox that
               she did not want anymore contact from Jacox. I told Raven and
               Nya that it would be a good idea to message Jacox telling him
               that they did not want any further contact from him in person,
               via social media, or any other forms of communication. I also
               told the two that they should block Jacox's profile. Other than
               feeling uncomfortable, Raven did not report anything that would
               be classified as harassment. I provided Raven with my business
               card and her case number. I told Raven that I would try and
               contact Jacox and tell him that both Raven and Nya did not want
               any further contact. I went over to Jacox's dorm room, Global
               Scholars Hall room 288 and knocked on the door. Jacox answered
               and I asked if we could talk. Jacox invited me in and I asked
               him if he knew why I wanted to talk to him. Jacox said it was
               because of a girl. As soon as Jacox began to talk I could tell
               by his speech and mannerisms that he had diminished mental

               capability. Without prompt Jacox knew I wanted to talk to him
               about Raven. I explained that Raven and Nya did not want to be
               his friend and they were a bit scared of Jacox. Jacox stated he
               understood and he had already block both of them on facebook. I
               told Jacox that he needed to not talk to either sister on
               social media or in person. Jacox stated he understood. I asked
               Jacox if there was any questions I could answer for him and he
               said no. After my conversation with Jacox, it is my belief that
               Jacox did not intend to make Raven uncomfortable, rather Jacox
               does not understand social queues. I called Raven back and left
               a message explaining my conversation with Jacox. This case will
               be referred to Title XI and OEO. END OF REPORT I certify and

               hrs I was dispatched to a reported harassment. The victim,
               later identified as Joshua K Hames (03/13/96), was awaiting
               contact at the WSU Police Department and upon contacting him I
               was told the following. Hames explained he had been receiving
               text messages from an individual, Devon Boucher, and was told
               to report them to the police. Upon viewing the text messages I
               noted Hames was visibly shaken and as I reviewed the text
               messages I noted there were no threats made. The text messages
               explained Boucher's displeasure over the electric bill. He went
               on to say he was going to contact the power company on 02/17/16
               and have the power turned off as a result of his displeasure.
               After viewing the text messages Hames and I spoke. I explained
               to him I saw no threats being made, which he agreed, and we
               discussed his safety following the previous case. He told me he
               was staying with friends and after I asked about if he had been
               given information regarding Alternatives to Violence of the
               Palouse, I was told he had. We discussed this for some time
               along with restraining orders and his right to apply for one if
               he felt that was what he needed to do. As we continued to speak
               I told him to contact Cpl Stewart on 02/17/16 regarding the
               text messages and the current status of his other case. I also
               suggested to discontinue responding for the time being and if
               necessary shut his phone off for the evening. Hames told me he
               would look into it and we concluded our conversation a short
               time later. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
