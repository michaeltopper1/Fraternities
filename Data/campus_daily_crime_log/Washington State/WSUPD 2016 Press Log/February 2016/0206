               On 02-06-2016 at about 2219 hrs I was dispatched to a report of
               a sick person at Olympia Hall, located at 1620 SE Olympia
               Avenue. Dispatch advised that Pullman Fire Department personnel
               had requested a police officer to respond to the scene. I
               arrived on scene and contacted Pullman Fire Department
               personnel and an unidentified residence hall staff member. I
               learned the following: The patient, identified as Belky L.
               Martinez Cruz (DOB 08-01-1996), had been in the main lobby of
               Olympia Hall. Martinez Cruz had approached the hall staff
               member working at the front desk and told him she had smoked
               marijuana with friends. Martinez Cruz told the staff member she
               was not feeling well and told him to call 911, which he did.
               Pullman Fire Department members arrived on scene and began
               treating Martinez Cruz. Martinez Cruz was placed into the
               ambulance and was being prepared for transport to the hospital.
               While in the ambulance, Martinez Cruz told the fire department
               members that she wanted to go to the hospital, and she wanted
               something sharp because she planned to kill herself. Martinez
               Cruz stated that she was in trouble and believed she was
               pregnant. Martinez Cruz said she had been hit by a car and
               indicated she wanted to speak with a police officer. Martinez
               Cruz said she had smoked marijuana and said someone had given
               her drugs. I entered the ambulance and attempted to speak with
               Martinez Cruz. Martinez Cruz's statements were random, and she
               was not able to formulate sentences or conduct normal
               conversation. Martinez Cruz was disoriented and appeared to be
               suffering from a mental disorder or was under the influence of
               drugs. I told the ambulance personnel that I would follow them
               to the hospital and would attempt to speak with Martinez Cruz
               in the emergency room. Before leaving the scene, I knocked on
               the door to Martinez Cruz's room, Olympia Hall #237. No one
               answered the door, and the room was quiet. I arrived at the
               hospital and spoke with Martinez Cruz. I explained to Martinez
               Cruz that I had placed her into protective custody because she
               had threatened to kill herself. I identified myself as a police
               officer and asked Martinez Cruz if she wanted to speak with me.
               Martinez Cruz replied and said, "I don't know, I have to think
               about it". Martinez Cruz appeared to be on the verge of falling
               asleep, and it was apparent to me that she was in no condition

               to participate in a conversation. I told Martinez Cruz that I
               would be leaving my business card with the hospital staff and
               told her to contact me later if she needed to speak with a
               police officer. I provided my business card to the nurse and
               told the nurse to remind Martinez Cruz that she could contact
               me when she was released from the hospital if she needed to
               speak with a police officer. I completed the protective custody
               form, and Martinez Cruz was admitted to the hospital. I cleared
               the scene. The protective custody form was scanned, downloaded
               into Spillman, and attached to this case. No further action at
               this time. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare under penalty of

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0612 SYNOPSIS: Subject reported her
               roommate is selling marijuana from their room. Investigation
               continues. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Kylie B.
               Serl/072297 2. NARRATIVE: On 02/06/16 at about 2320 hrs
               Dispatch advised of a report from hall staff in Stephenson
               South regarding someone possibly selling marijuana from their
               dorm room. I responded to room 1105 and contacted the
               complainant, Erin I. Nixon (021396), who told me one of her
               residents, Ishana S. Trivedi-Bbion (042397), came to her and
               said her roommate, Kylie B. Serl (072297), was selling
               marijuana from their room and she did not want to get in
               trouble because of it. I spoke to Trivedi-Bbion, who told me
               she got in trouble before when Serl was smoking marijuana in
               their room. Trivedi-Bbion told me since the spring semester
               started Serl has been selling marijuana from their room. She
               told me she has personally seen Serl sell marijuana to people
               who come to their room. Trivedi-Bbion is concerned she is going
               to get in trouble again for her roommates actions. She
               confronted Serl over it earlier in the day. She said Serl took
               a purse which had the imprint of a mason jar in it, out of the
               room. When she returned the purse was no longer shaped like a
               mason jar. According to Trivedi-Bbion Serl keeps her marijuana
               in a small mason jar. She said the jar is no longer where Serl
               use to keep it in the room. Their only friend in the building
               is Mason Sadiarin, who lives in room 803. She saw Serl take the
               purse down the stairs and assumes that is where she took it
               because there was no where else for her to go. She also saw
               Serl Facebook messaging Sadiarin prior to taking the marijuana
               out of the room. There was not enough information for a search
               warrant for Sadiarin's room so I went and knocked on the door
               but received no answer. Trivedi-Bbion thought Serl was out at a
               party for the night. I will be attempting to contact both Serl
               and Sadiarin at another time. More to follow. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               7 day of February, 2016, in Pullman, Washington.
