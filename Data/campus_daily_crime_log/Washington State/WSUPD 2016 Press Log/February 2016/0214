    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: JAK/333 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0745 SYNOPSIS: A mother of a WSU student
               called stating she has not spoken to her daughter since 02-12-
               16 and was concerned. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               2. NARRATIVE: On 02-14-16, at approximately 0912 hours, Lourdes
               Sebastian Salvador (03-30-81) called Whitcom wanting some
               assistance checking on the welfare of her daughter. I called
               Lourdes and asked her to explain what was going on to me. She
               said she had spoken with her daughter several times on Friday
               (02-12-14), the last time being approximately 0100 hours on 02-
               13-16. Her daughter said she had broken the screen on her phone
               and it may be acting up. Lourdes texted back and forth with her
               daughter, Ana L. Abelo Sebastian (06-11-97), on Saturday 02-13-
               16, with the last time being between 1900 and 2000 hours. She
               said she has not heard from her daughter since that time and is
               concerned. I asked Lourdes if she had had any trouble with
               people wanting to hurt her in the past and she said "No". She
               said Ana has always been a good girl and had never been in any
               trouble. She said her daughter was attending WSU in order to
               get her GED. I told Lourdes I would attempt to contact Ana and
               would have someone get back to her. I checked "MyWSU" and found
               Ana is assigned to Orton Hall; room 223. I responded to Orton
               Hall and knocked on the door to room 223. No one answered. I
               knocked on the door for the 2nd floor Resident Advisor (Carlos)
               and no one answered the door. I responded to Cleveland Hall
               thinking the HEP (High School Equivalency Program) may have
               been in session, but it was not. I contacted the Director of
               the HEP Program, Lori Manzanares, and explained what was going
               on. She said Ana was doing very well in the program and had
               told her she was going to stay in her room over the weekend.
               She said she would try to contact some of the other students
               who are enrolled in the program to see if Ana could be
               contacted. I asked her to contact me if someone was able to
               make contact with her and she said she would. I called
               Manzanares again at approximately 1530 hours to see if anyone
               had been able to contact Ana. She said they have not been able
               to contact her, but said she should be in her room no later
               than 2200 hours as they have a curfew. At approximately 1559
               hours, I tried calling Lourdes again at (360) 244-0340 and
               received a voice message stating the caller has a voice mail
               box that has not been set up. I was not able to speak with
               anyone or leave a voice message. I have asked Sergeant Griffin
               (Swing Shift Sergeant) to try to make contact with Ana this
               evening (02-14-16). Investigation continues. I certify and

               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 02/14/16 I
               learned that there was a fire at a WSU building on 02/11/16.
               The building is a residence and is located at 2253 Country Club
               Rd. I contacted Whitcom and learned that no law enforcement
               from WSU responded and also found out that the address
               "geobases" as a Whitman County Sheriff Office call. I responded
               to the residence and found that on the northwest side of the
               residence a garage and possibly an outbuilding were completely
               destroyed by a fire. I knocked on the door to the residence,
               but received no answer. I notified Ofc. Jones of the fire and
               asked him to further investigate it on 02/15/16. I took photos
               of the scene and saved them to the case. I learned that Jerry
               E. Glass 09/17/70 is a resident at this address and is the one
               who called to report the fire. Investigation continues. I

               POM & Fake ID 6Z0310688 6Z0310689 2. NARRATIVE: On 02/14/16 at
               approximately 1230 hours I was parked in the rear/side lot of
               Honors Hall monitoring traffic at the intersections of Campus
               and B and Spokane Sts. I saw the defendant traveling south on
               NE B St approaching the intersection with Campus St, which is a
               clearly posted STOP intersection. I watched as the defendant
               slowed down and turned left onto Campus St without stopping. As
               the defendant turned I noticed he was holding his phone up to
               his ear as well. I activated my emergency lights and stopped
               the vehicle across from Davis Hall. I advised the driver of the
               reason for the stop and that the stop was being recorded. I
               asked the driver for his license, registration, and proof of
               insurance. The driver provided me with an expired insurance
               card and a temporary license. The driver was identified as Ryan
               M. Mazure Schmidt 04/03/97. While Ryan was looking for current
               information, I could smell the odor of fresh marijuana coming
               from the interior of the vehicle. I asked Ryan how old he was
               and he said 18. I asked Ryan if he had a medical marijuana card
               and he said no. I asked Ryan if he knew why I was asking and he
               said because it smelled like marijuana. I asked Ryan how much
               marijuana was in the car and he said he did not believe there
               was any. Ryan then said it would be his friends if he had some.
               I asked Ryan where it would be and he said either the center
               console or the glove box. I asked Ryan if he wanted to check,
               which he did. Ryan removed a glass jar with marijuana from the
               center console, and when he did I noticed an out of state
               license on top of it, which fell into the console. I asked Ryan
               about the ID and asked if it was his and he said no. I told
               Ryan he is not supposed to be in possession of other peoples
               licenses and asked him to grab it. At first Ryan tried to act
               like he didn't know what I was talking about, but eventually
               handed me a fictitious Illinois license, making him 21. The
               license had the same street address as his WADL did. Ryan
               retrieved a sandwich bag containing marijuana and gave it to
               me. I returned to my patrol car and issued Ryan a SECTOR
               citation for Possession of Marijuana and Possession of a
               Fictitious ID. I returned to Ryan's vehicle and explained the
               tickets to him. I advised him of his right to counsel and
               reminded him that he was being audio and video recorded. I
               provided Ryan with a copy of the tickets and told him he was

               NIK test kit, which showed a presumptive positive result for
               Cannabis Sativa. I photographed the items and logged them into
               evidence. I put both quantities of marijuana together into the
               sandwich bag. Due to having multiple charges I chose to issued
               Ryan a citation in lieu of forwarding charges. I certify and

               could tell a window in the room was open because there was an
               obvious breeze coming from inside the room. With the airflow
               coming from the room I could smell a strong odor of marijuana
               coming out of the room. I noticed the male's eyes were
               extremely bloodshot, which is one sign of ingesting marijuana.
               The resident denied smoking marijuana and claimed he had been
               sleeping. It was clear to me based on my training and
               experience that he had been smoking marijuana in the room. He
               refused to admit to smoking marijuana and refused to identify
               himself. I told him his refusal to cooperate would be sent to
               student conduct as well as the report regarding the strong odor
               of marijuana coming from his room. I was later given the names
               of the residents of room 232 by hall staff. I looked at the
               resident's cougar card photos on mywsu and determined the
               resident I spoke to was Samuel J. Loomis (090596). I did not
               see any indication that the other resident of the room was
               present at the time. Incident referred to student conduct only.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 15 day of February, 2016, in
               Pullman, Washington. _______________________________________

               WAC/BB gun in dorm NARRATIVE: On 02-15-16 at approximately 0044
               hours I was dispatched to the report of a suspicious persons
               report at Northside Residence Hall, located at 1590 NE Cougar
               Way. Dispatch advised two males were seen in the elevator about
               30 minutes ago with what looked like BB guns. The subjects were
               last seen on the third floor and believed to be going to their
               room. Ofc. Boyd and I arrived on scene. The Hall Director on
               duty, Acacia L. Kapusta (DOB 08-25-89) and Resident Advisor
               (RA) on duty, Yousef F. Nazer (DOB 09-20-83) met us in the
               lobby. I asked if either Kapusta or Nazer witnessed anything.
               Nazer said no, that the resident on the third floor reported it
               to their RA and that he called Nazer. Nazer told me the two
               suspects are Tavares L. Martin (DOB 02-04-96) and Isaiah J.
               Johnson (DOB 11-28-97). I asked Nazer if I may speak with the
               witness, and he told me yeah but that she was worried about the
               individuals with the BB guns finding out because she lives
               close by to them. Nazer went to room #386B and knocked on the
               door. A female answered the door and he asked if he may speak
               with Taylor A. Shewchuk (DOB 11-20-96). Shewchuk came outside
               and I asked if I may speak with her in the nearby study lounge.
               I asked Shewchuk if she saw two males with BB guns early, and
               she said yeah. She told me that two males that live down the
               hallway from her had each bought a BB gun at Walmart. I asked
               her how she knew the males had purchased the BB guns at
               Walmart, and she told me she had been in a car with them
               earlier at Walmart. Shewchuk said there were two other girls in
               the car, but they did not know the males were buying the BB
               guns. She said her friends and her were buying groceries and
               when the males returned to the car they had the BB guns in a
               bag. Shewchuk said in the car both males removed the BB guns
               from the wrappers and were looking at them. She said when they
               all returned to Northside Residence Hall she had taken the
               stairs back to the third floor, and the two males and her two
               female friends got on the elevator. Shewchuk said some other
               people had seen the males with BB guns as well when they got
               off of the elevator. I asked Shewchuk if the males loaded the
               BB guns with BB's inside of the car, and she said "no I don't
               think so". I asked her when they bought the BB guns, and she
               said on 02-14-16 at approximately 2030 hours. I asked Shewchuk
               if they had any other BB guns in their, and she said "I have no

               idea". I asked her what the BB guns looked like, and she said
               they were black in color and looked like real guns. Shewchuk
               said each male had purchased a BB gun. Shewchuk mentioned that
               one of the males dropped the BB gun in the elevator when people
               were exiting the elevator, and that other people had seen it.
               She told me she thinks they had the BB guns in their pockets. I
               asked her if the males mentioned why they bought the BB guns,
               and she said she did not know why. I asked Shewchuk if the
               males had purchased BB's as well, and she said she did not
               know. She mentioned they may have been inside the grocery bag,
               but that she never saw them. I asked Shewchuk if she knew if
               the BB guns had been pointed at anyone, and she said no. She
               told me when she got up the stairs she heard someone say "oh
               no". Shewchuk said she asked her friends what happened, and
               they told her that one of the males dropped the BB gun on the
               floor. I thanked Shewchuk for her time. Ofc. Olmstead arrived
               on scene because he spoke with Martin and Johnson in the past
               about BB guns (see related case #16-W0261 for full report).
               Some windows in Regents Hall had been shot out with BB gun
               pellets in the past, and the shots appeared to have come from a
               room in Northside Residence Hall. Ofc. Olmstead and I went to
               room #382A. I knocked on the door and a male answered the door
               and identified himself as Tavares L. Martin (DOB 02-04-96). I
               asked Martin if I may speak with him, and he said "yes sir".
               Ofc. Olmstead told Martin that he needed to speak with his
               roommate as well. Isaiah J. Johnson (DOB 11-28-97) came out of
               the room and went with Ofc. Olmstead to speak with him (see
               Ofc. Olmstead's supplemental report). Martin and I walked to
               the nearby study lounge to speak. I told Martin I was recording
               and that he was free to leave at anytime. I asked him if he
               knew why I wanted to speak with him, and he replied "the dirt
               bikes". I told him I needed to speak with him about that as
               well, but I was there for another reason. Kapusta had told us
               Martin and Johnson have been riding mini dirt bikes on the
               sidewalk near Northside Hall. I asked Johnson if he had bought
               a BB gun, and he said "oh yeah". I asked him if he wanted to
               tell me about it and he said he had just recently purchased the
               BB gun. I told Martin I needed to read him something, and I
               read him his Constitutional Rights from my department issued
               Miranda Warning card. I asked him if he understood his rights,
               and he said yes. I asked him if he wished to speak with me now,
               and he replied "no sir". I told Martin I knew he had a BB gun
               inside of his room. I told him it was against university policy
               and his housing contract to have a BB gun inside of his dorm
               room. I suggested to Martin that he turn the BB gun over to me
               and that I would lock it up at the Public Safety Building. I
               told Martin he would be allowed to come and check the BB gun
               out if he wanted, but it could not be stored in his dorm room.
               Martin told me that we could throw it away. I told him that he
               could at least return the BB gun and get his money back if he
               wanted. I asked Martin if he would mind giving it to me so we
               could lock it up at the station for him, and he replied "yes
               sir". Martin went back to his room and brought me his BB gun
               and the BB's. I told Martin since he had the BB gun in his dorm
               room he would be referred to WSU Student Conduct, and he told

               me he understood. Martin was polite and cooperative throughout
               my encounter with him. Once Ofc. Olmstead finished interviewing
               Johnson he told me that Johnson did not admit to shooting out
               the windows in Regents Hall. See Ofc. Olmstead's supplemental
               report for more details. Johnson turned over his BB gun to Ofc.
               Olmstead. We all cleared the scene. I later checked Martin's
               and Johnson's BB gun's into the gun room at the Public Safety
               Building. The investigation continues. My Vievu camera was
               activated, and the video was later downloaded into the
               permanent digital evidence folder. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 15th day of
               February, 2016, in Pullman, Washington.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0755 SYNOPSIS: Pullman PD requested an
               officer check a residence hall for a subject of a welfare check
               they received. The residence was checked and found unoccupied.
               The subject was later located by Pullman PD off campus.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               02/15/16 at about 0357 Dispatch advised Pullman PD was
               requesting assistance with a Welfar Check call they received.
               The subject was possibly at a boyfriends residence off campus
               but lived in Northside Hall. They asked we check northside hall
               for the subject due to suicidal text messages that were sent. I
               checked mywsu and determined the subject, Paige K. Spring
               (072397), lived at 484 Northside Hall. I went to the residence
               and knocked on the door several times. Due to the suicidal
               nature of the text messages I keyed into the room and found no
               one inside. I had Dispatch advise Pullman PD the residence was
               checked and found empty. Pullmnan PD later located Spring and
               transported her to the hospital, see related case. Nothing
