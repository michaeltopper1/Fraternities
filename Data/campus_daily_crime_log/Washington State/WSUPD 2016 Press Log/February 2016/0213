               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0727 SYNOPSIS: An oven fire occurred
               inside Chinook Village Apartment U97 while the resident was
               baking cookies. The resident was able to extinguish the fire
               prior the the Fire Department arriving on scene. NAME/DOB

               approximately 1236 hours, Sergeant Kuhrt and I responded to the
               Chinook Village Apartments (U97) for the call of a structure
               fire. Upon our arrival, we found the apartment door opened and
               a female inside the apartment. We identified the female as the
               apartment resident, Lindsay J. Wilson (03-06-95). We also
               observed a white colored powder substance all over the kitchen.
               Wilson stated she had been baking cookies when she smelled
               smoke and observed flames inside her oven. She got a fire
               extinguisher and used it to put the fire out. The fire was
               contained to inside of the oven. Wilson was advised not to use
               the oven until someone from WSU came to look at and fix it.
               Sergeant Kuhrt told Wilson she should contact her Apartment
               Coordinator and that he would contact the WSU Housing
               Maintenance on her behalf and advise them of the situation. We
               cleared. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true

               Leandro M. Lessin 12/31/96 Warned Student Conduct POM
               NARRATIVE: On 02/13/16 at approximately 1400 hours Intern
               Arnevick and I were traveling near the intersection of SE
               Olympia Ave and SE Forest Way when I saw two individuals
               walking southwest through the parking lot of the old Carver
               Farms along a building. I have never seen anyone walking in
               this area previously so I drove closer and watched. I saw a
               male and female stop at one of the buildings and the female
               walked to a door and the male walked to a garage door. I could
               not see what the female was doing, but I noticed the male
               looking into the window on the garage door. I drove down
               towards the two, who were now walking back to the northeast.
               When the two saw me it appeared that both subjects moved their
               hands from their jacket pockets and I saw something fall to the
               ground, but I could not tell who it fell from. As I exited my
               patrol car I asked Intern Arnevick to go see what was dropped
               in the parking lot. As I walked towards the two, the wind was
               blowing from their back towards me and I could smell the odor
               of burning marijuana. I asked the two what they were doing at
               the building and they said they were just curious what it was.
               I asked where they lived and they said Olympia Hall. I asked if
               they had ID and was provided Cougar Cards, identifying them as
               Rebecca Rambo & Leandro Lessin. I asked if either was 21 and
               they said no. They were both watching Intern Arnevick as he
               retrieved something from the parking lot from the exact
               location they just walked. I asked them if they knew why I was
               asking if they were 21 and Lessin said because they were
               smoking. I asked Lessin what they were smoking and he pointed
               towards Intern Arnevick, who walked over and handed me a
               "roach" that smelled of burnt marijuana. I asked if both of
               them were smoking from it and they said yes. I warned both for
               possession of marijuana and told them I would be sending my
               case to student conduct. I told them they were free to go and
               returned to WSUPD and logged the roach into evidence for
               destruction. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 13th day of February, 2016, in

               start for the vehicle. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               2. NARRATIVE: On 02-13-16 at approximately 2153 hours I was on
               patrol in the area of Olympia Ave, when I observed a white,
               2003 Honda CRV (WA Lic. 633ZRB) parked on the side of the road
               with the hood up. There was a group of males standing around
               the vehicle and they appeared to be trying to jump start it. I
               drove by and asked them if they needed assistance, and they
               said yes. I parked my patrol vehicle and walked over to the
               Honda that was parked next to the Rogers Orton Play field. The
               vehicle the individuals were trying to use to jump start the
               Honda with was not doing the trick. I told them I would go grab
               a jump pack from the station, and that I would be back in a few
               minutes. I returned to the Honda and was able to successfully
               jump start the vehicle. The driver of the vehicle was
               identified as Aleczander D. Martin (DOB 02-26-95) by his WA
               driver's license. Martin thanked me, and I cleared the scene.
               No further action. My Vievu camera was activated, and the video
               was later downloaded into the permanent digital evidence
               folder. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 14th day of February, 2016, in Pullman,

               of Marijuana NARRATIVE: On 02-13-16 at approximately 2323 hours
               I was dispatched to the report of the odor of marijuana coming
               from room #463 in Regents Hall, located at 1580 NE Cougar Way.
               Sgt. Daniels and I arrived on scene. The resident advisor (RA)
               on duty, Kristen A. Sparkman (DOB 03-01-94) met us in the
               lobby. She told me she could smell the odor of marijuana coming
               from the room and she thought people were still inside. We
               walked to room #463 and I could smell the odor of burnt
               marijuana and various fragrances through the crack in the door.
               I knocked on the door several times and a female later
               identified as Ashley N. Ceniceros (DOB 06-14-97) opened the
               door. There was a male inside of the room who was later
               identified as Jacob T. Osborn (DOB 09-06-96). I told Ceniceros
               and Osborn I was audio and video recording. I asked Ceniceros
               if she knew why I was there, and she said no. I then asked her
               who has marijuana in the room, and she replied "okay, I'm sorry
               that was me". I asked if either of them were over the age of
               21, and they both said no. I asked Ceniceros and Osborn if
               either of them had a medical marijuana card, and they both said
               no. I asked who the marijuana belonged to, and Ceniceros
               replied "it was mine". She told me that Osborn had nothing to
               do with it. I asked her if she had been smoking in her dorm
               room, and she told me she had been earlier. Osborn told me he
               had not smoked any marijuana. I asked him if he had been in the
               room when Ceniceros had been smoking marijuana, and he said he
               was not. I asked Ceniceros what she was using to smoke out of,
               and she said a pipe. I told Cencieros I wanted her to gather up
               all her marijuana, alcohol, any other illegal drugs, and drug
               paraphernalia. Ceniceros brought over a small orange pill
               container containing a small amount of fresh marijuana, a glass
               pipe with burnt marijuana residue, a flask, and a bottle
               containing vodka. I asked her what was inside of the flask, and
               she told me it was whiskey. The vodka was a fifth and was less
               than a third full. I explained to both Ceniceros and Osborn

               that they would be sent to WSU Student Conduct, and they told
               me they understood. Sgt. Daniels and I explained to Osborn that
               even though he denied smoking he put himself in a bad position
               by being in the room with someone who had recently smoked
               marijuana. Ceniceros walked outside with me to the nearby
               dumpster. I had her dispose of the marijuana, pipe, and alcohol
               inside of the dumpster. Ceniceros was very apologetic. They
               were both polite and cooperative throughout our encounter. No
               further action. My Vievu camera was activated, and the video
               was later downloaded into the permanent digital evidence
               folder. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under

               approximately 0114 hours, I was advised of a third party report
               of a possible verbal domestic dispute. Ofc. Olmstead, Tiengo,
               and I responded to the apartment. From outside, I could not
               hear any disturbance. I knocked on the door and a male
               identified as Yousef Nazer, opened the door. I could see two
               small children behind him. I explained to him why I was there
               and he stated he understood. Nazer stated he and his wife were
               home, but had not been arguing. I asked if I could speak with
               her and he stated she was in the kitchen. He stated I could
               come in, but she did not have her head dress on as they are
               Muslim. I entered the apartment and spoke to his wife, Haifaa
               Al/Hindi. I told her why we were there and she denied they had
               been arguing. I asked her why someone would call and say they
               heard loud voices, and she stated she didn't know. She stated
               they were not yelling as their son was asleep upstairs. Ofc.
               Tiengo spoke to Nazer who stated the same thing. We were unable
               to anything had happened as both parties denied having an
               argument or talking with raised voices. I went outside and
               spoke to the RP, the Apartment Coordinator. He stated he had
               been contacted by neighbor who did not want her information
               used. She had stated she had heard arguing, and it had been
               happening a lot lately. He stated it may have been a matter of
               perspective as to the yelling. He stated he had instructed the
               neighbor to call directly next time there was an issue. While
               en route to the call I had Whitcom check for history at the
               apartment and there have been no calls associated with noise or
               domestic violence. We cleared. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
