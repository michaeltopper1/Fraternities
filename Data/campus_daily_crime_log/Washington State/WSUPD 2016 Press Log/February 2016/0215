               (05/16/97) Warned Possession of Pistol 18-21 2. NARRATIVE: On
               02/15/16 around 2018 hrs I was dispatched to a request for a
               gun check. During the check in procedure I identified the male
               requesting the gun check by his Washington State Drivers
               License, Jacob D Benavidez (05/16/97). Benavidez told me he
               wanted to check in his firearms, which included 1 rifle and 1
               Glock 22 handgun. As we were completing the check in procedure
               I looked in the pistol box and found it contained a Glock 22
               .40 caliber handgun. I asked Benavidez if the handgun was his
               or his parents and was told it is registered to his father, but
               was purchased by him. I explained the law to him and told him
               he was not permitted to carry it except under certain
               conditions. We discussed this as we checked in his rifle and it
               was agreed he would not be allowed to check the Glock back out
               until his father arrived prior to spring break. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 15th day of February, 2016, in Pullman,
