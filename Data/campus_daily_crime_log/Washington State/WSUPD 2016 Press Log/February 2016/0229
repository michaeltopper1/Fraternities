               the report of the odor of marijuana coming from her room.
               Foster said she could smell it too and it was coming from her
               downstair's neighbor. I could not smell any odor of marijuana
               at this time. I went down to room 231 and knocked, with the

               they were not smoking marijuana, which I did not smell. I went
               back to 331 and spoke with Taylor. I told Taylor the odor was
               not coming from downstairs and to be honest. Taylor said she
               had smoked marijuana in her car earlier using an apple. I
               warned Taylor for smoking marijuana and I left. I certify and

               responded and met with Cassandra Olds in the parking lot of

               DEPARTMENT CASE #:16-W1049 SYNOPSIS: Report of two subjects
               riding dirt bikes on the sidewalk and against traffic on Cougar
               Way. Subjects contacted and warned, football staff notified.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               02/29/16 at approximately 1230 hours I was dispatched to a
               traffic offense near Mooberry Track. After completing two other
               calls I responded and called the reporting party, Shannon
               Rogers. Rogers explained that she was walking on the track when
               two African American males wearing jerseys rode small dirt
               bikes on the sidewalks and against traffic on Cougar Way. As I
               was in the area looking for the subjects I saw them driving up
               the hillside on the west of Northside Hall near the bike
               storage. I contacted the two as they were putting the dirt
               bikes away. I asked if they had been previously warned about
               riding the bikes and they said they had. I asked for their
               ID's, which they provided, identifying them as Isaiah Johnson
               and Tavares Martin. I asked why they were riding their bikes if
               they'd been warned and they said they had to get milk shakes.
               They then mentioned something about practice. I explained the
               plethora of infractions I could issue them. I told them I would
               be notifying coaching staff in an effort to fix the issue
               without imposing monetary fines. The dirt bikes are not
               registered or street legal, so I do not have any information on
               them. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 29th day of February,
               2016, in Pullman, Washington.

               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W1050 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched
               to a report of trespassing at the Compton Union Building. The
               complainant reported that someone had climbed onto the roof.
               The suspect was not located. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 02-29-2016 at about 1317 hrs I
               was dispatched to a report of trespassing at the Compton Union
               Building (CUB), located at 1500 NE Terrell Mall. Dispatch
               advised that someone had climbed up onto the roof and then ran
               away when contacted by CUB staff members. Sergeant Kuhrt and I
               arrived on scene, and I contacted the complainant, Zachary A.
               Gill (DOB 02-21-1995). Gill is a CUB employee. Sergeant Kuhrt
               checked the area for the suspect. Gill stated that about ten
               minutes ago, he was outside on the plaza above the Terrell
               Library. Gill said he observed a male jump over the railing on
               the west side of the CUB in order to access the lowest roof of
               the CUB. Gill watched as the male left his backpack on the roof
               and then climbed up the wall of the CUB to the next highest
               roof. Gill said he went inside the CUB to call for help. Gill
               returned to the area with another CUB staff member but could
               not find the male. Gill saw that the male's backpack was still
               on the roof. Gill said the male then returned, climbed back
               onto the lowest roof, and retrieved his backpack. Gill
               confronted the male and told him to stop. The male ignored
               Gill, walked to the edge of the roof, and then jumped about 10
               feet down to the ground. Once on the ground, Gill said the male
               ran eastbound on Terrell Mall. Gill described the male as:
               white male; college age; 5-08; 140 lbs.; slender build; light
               brown hair; blue jeans; burgundy colored hoodie with gray in
               color sleeves; "Under Armour" brand backpack that was black and
               red in color. The area was checked, but the suspect was not
               located. I told Gill to notify his supervisor and other CUB
               staff members of the incident and to conduct extra security
               checks of the roof. I told Gill to call 911 if someone was
               located on the roof again. No further action at this time.

               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W1052 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched

               reported that someone had posted threatening statements on

               a report of suspicious circumstances. Dispatch advised that
               someone had posted threatening statements on Craigslist. I
               contacted the complainant, Donna J. Hime (DOB 07-14-1955), on
               the telephone. While I was on the computer, Hime directed me to
               the suspicious message, which was posted on the Pullman-Moscow
               Craigslist page under the "rants & raves" section. I read the
               message and saw that the message included threats to kill WSU
               students. The message has been scanned, downloaded into
               Spillman, and attached to this case. Upon further
               investigation, I learned that this incident was currently under
               investigation by the Pullman Police Department (PPD). I
               contacted Sergeant Dornes from PPD on the telephone. Sergeant
               Dornes advised that they had identified a person of interest
               and would be continuing with the investigation. It was also
               noted that the message included a reference to Walmart and that
               the person of interest resided off campus. It was decided that
               the investigation would be handled by PPD. For more
               information, see related case 16-P02063. No further
               investigation at this time. Olmstead/339 I certify and declare

               approximately 2112 hours I was dispatched to the report of a
               suspicious vehicle in the yellow 1 parking lot, located at 925
               NE North Fairway Rd. Dispatch advised the complainant, Robin J.
               Cambier (DOB 07-06-92), saw a grey, 2014 Toyota Fiji Cruise (WA
               Lic. AOU0184) with one of the doors left wide open. Dispatch
               advised Cambier said nobody was in the area of the vehicle. I
               tried calling the owner of the Toyota, Trenton J. Williams (DOB
               10-17-93), on the phone. However, the first time I could barely
               hear the male voice on the other end. I tried calling back
               several times, but there was no answer and his voicemail box
               had not been set up. I went to the yellow 1 parking lot. I saw
               the Toyota with the driver's side door wide open. I spoke with
               Cambier who said he noticed the door was open on the Toyota
               around 2105 hours on 02-29-16. I asked Cambier if he saw anyone
               near the vehicle, and he said no. He said the only other person
               he saw was standing near a truck. Cambier pointed out the male
               who he had saw earlier because he returned to the parking lot.
               I went over to the male, who was later identified as Kyle D.
               Everitt (DOB 04-02-94). I asked Everitt if he had seen anyone
               near the Toyota earlier, and he said no. Everitt told me he had
               parked his vehicle in the lot around 30 minutes ago, and had
               noticed the driver's side door to the vehicle had been left
               open. The Toyota had a bunch of items that appeared to be of
               value still inside of the vehicle. Inside was military
               equipment and uniforms that looked like they belonged to
               someone in ROTC, along with a backpack and other various items.
               It did not appear as if anyone had been inside of the vehicle.
               The doors were unlocked, and there was no damage to the

               pass along information. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               2. NARRATIVE: On 02/29/16 around 2155 hrs I was dispatched to a
               report of suspected drug activity at apartment K 38 of the Nez
               Perce Apartments. I contacted the reporting party, who was
               identified as Haley C Alexander (02/23/94) and who wished to
               remain non disclosed, who told me the following. At
               approximately 2130 hrs Alexander explained she had been
               upstairs in her apartment, K39 of the Nez Perce Apartments. She
               went on to explain around this point she had heard voices
               outside of her window in the lawn below. As she continued to
               listen she recognized one of the voices as possibly being one
               of the residents in the apartment to the left of K-39, if you
               were facing the front door. As the conversation continued she
               explained she believed she had heard what sounded like a drug
               deal being made. I asked her for specifics and she told me she
               heard the male she believed to be her next door neighbor say
               something along the lines of "I'll give you a half an ounce for
               $40.00." and a response which agreed. I asked Alexander what
               she could see regarding the individuals and was told all she
               would tell is they were two males. When asked about the voice
               she told me she had recognized I was told she had been certain
               his voice was one of the two she heard. She went on to tell me
               she recognized it from previous interactions, but did not know
               a name and couldn't tell where he had been standing in
               relationship to the two males she was viewing. As Alexander and
               I continued to speak she told me she wished to remain non
               disclosed and wanted the information passed along. I told her I
               would look into this further before passing it along and asked
               her to let me know if she started noticing anything else out of
               the ordinary in the area such as odd vehicles and or people
               coming and going at odd hours. She told me she would and we
               concluded our conversation a short time later. Following our
               conversation I checked Spillman and found no involvements at
               apartment K-40 and will ask dayshift to contact Housing
               services in an attempt to identify the residents before
               proceeding further. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 29th day of February,

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W1061 SYNOPSIS: Subject reported someone
               in Regents Hall was suicidal and may have cut herself. Officers
               and Pullman medics responded. After subject was checked on by
               medics, officer placed subject into protective custody. She was

               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Raevyn S. Kagawa-
               Burke/10-29-95 Protective Custody 2. NARRATIVE: On 02-29-16 at
               approximately 2334 hours I was dispatched to the report of a
               possible suicide attempt at Regents Hall #266, located at 1580
               NE Cougar Way. Dispatch advised the complainant, Nichole C.
               Chambers (DOB 10-08-94), was concerned that her friend, Raevyn
               S. Kagawa-Burke (DOB 10-29-95), was going to hurt herself
               tonight. Chambers said Kagawa-Burke's ex-boyfriend got a call
               from her saying that she had cut herself and had access to
               anti-depressants. I arrived on scene. I went to room #266 and
               knocked on the door, and a female later identified as Kagawa-
               Burke answered the door. I noticed she had a small band aid on
               the inside of her left arm just above her wrist. I could see
               dry blood on the band aid. There appeared to be other several
               scars on her arms from cutting in the past. There were no other
               visible injuries on Kagawa-Burke. I radioed Dispatch and
               advised them medics could downgrade their response, and the
               scene was safe for them to come inside. Ofc. Olmstead soon
               arrived on scene. I asked her if she knew why we were there,
               and she said no that she had just been sleeping. I told her we
               received a report that she had been cutting herself, and she
               told me she had cut herself a couple hours ago. She removed the
               band aid and showed me her self inflicted injuries. The cuts
               were horizontal, and did not appear very deep. I asked her why
               she did it, and she told me she suffers from depression. I
               asked her if she was thinking about killing herself, and she
               said no. Kagawa-Burke told me she has been cutting herself for
               over 8 years now. She told me she sees a counselor regularly
               and is currently taking anti-depressant medication. Although,
               she told me the medication does not seem to be working for her
               and she believes she needs a stronger dosage. Pullman medics
               soon arrived on scene. They looked at her cut marks and
               determined they did not need to transport her to the hospital.
               They cleared the scene. Ofc. Welter soon arrived on scene. I
               asked Kagawa-Burke if she only cuts her wrists or if she ever
               cuts anywhere else on her body, and she told me only above her
               wrists. Earlier Dispatch advised her ex boyfriend, Nico M.
               Morales (DOB 04-13-92), thought she may have cut her leg as

               well. I asked about her legs, but she denied cutting them. I
               told Kagawa-Burke that I thought it would be a good idea if she
               went and spoke with someone at the hospital tonight, but she
               told me she did not want to. She told me she was not going to
               the hospital because it costs a lot of money, which she does
               not have. I asked Kagawa-Burke what she had been using to cut
               herself with, and she told me a razor. She said in the past she
               used a knife, but had thrown it away because she did not want
               to cut herself anymore. I asked her if I may have the razor,
               and she said no that she needed it for shaving. I asked Kagawa-
               Burke if I could see the text messages between her and Morales,
               and she told me yes. She handed me her phone and showed me the
               messages. There were several messages between Kagawa-Burke and
               Morales. I asked her about what time did she tell Morales she
               had cut herself, and she said around 2100 hours. At 2025 hours
               there was a text from Kagawa-Burke that read "I hurt myself".
               At 2044 hours Morales replied "How did you do that?", and
               Kagwa-Burke said "Cut. I found a way". She later texted "I'm
               just pathetic I know" "I wanna keep doing it". At 2148 she
               texted "I only wanted to talk to u but ur busy. No matter. I
               drugged myself so I'll b asleep soon". I went and spoke with
               Ofc. Welter and determined Kagawa-Burke should go to the
               hospital tonight. I told her I would be taking her to the
               hospital and she began to get upset because she said it was too
               expensive. I told her she did not have a choice because I was
               placing her into protective custody. I searched her, and told
               her she was not under arrest but in protective custody. I
               advised her I was audio and video recording. I walked her
               outside to my patrol vehicle, and I placed her in the back. I
               transported Kagawa-Burke to Pullman Regional Hospital where she
               was turned over to the care of medical professionals. The
               protective custody form has been downloaded into Spillman. I
               cleared the scene. I later called Chambers on the phone.
               Chambers told me that her and Kagawa-Burke are in the same
               sorority. She said "Kayla" was with Morales earlier in the
               evening. She said Morales had been on the phone with Kagawa-
               Burke when Kayla was with him. Chambers said Kayla mentioned
               that Kagawa-Burke told Morales she had cut herself and she also
               had sleeping pills she was going to take, but unsure if she had
               taken them. Chambers said Kagawa-Burke had also been texting
               "Lindsey" another friend, but all of a sudden stopped replying.
               Chambers said another girl from their sorority lives on the
               same floor as Kagawa-Burke and went to her room to go check on
               her. However, she never answered the door. The girl then went
               to the Resident Advisor (RA) and she went and checked on
               Kagawa-Burke. She said Kagawa-Burke answered the door, but did
               not want to talk with the RA and told her she was going back to
               sleep. Chambers told me that Kagawa-Burke has cut herself in
               the past. She said that Kagawa-Burke usually cuts herself on
               her thighs, and the insides of her elbows. Chambers told me
               that Kagawa-Burke has threatened suicide in the past with
               cutting and taking pills. I asked if she specifically mentioned
               she wanted to kill herself, and Chambers said no. I called
               Morales on the phone. He told me him and Kagawa-Burke dated for
               a few months before breaking up in January, 2016. He said

               Kagawa-Burke was asking him for help over text several times,
               but h3 did not see it because he was busy doing other things.
               He said she later texted him saying that she had cut herself.
               Morales told me that him and Kagawa-Burke had spoken on the
               phone a couple times as well in the night. He said when she
               called he was stressed over school and other things and did not
               feel like talking. Morales said he has tried to help her cope
               in the past, but he is tired of her not listening to him when
               he tells her that she needs to seek other help. He said Kagawa-
               Burke kept telling him that nobody likes her. They eventually
               hung up. Kagawa-Burke eventually called him back. She told him
               she had a panic attack earlier and now can't sleep. She told
               Morales she was going to take sleeping pills. Morales said
               Kagawa-Burke also mentioned she had a headache and would be
               taking pills for that as well. Morales told me he was upset and
               told her not to contact him for the rest of the night because
               he did not want to hear her overdose on the phone. Kagawa-Burke
               told him that she would not overdose. Morales told me he knows
               about Kagawa-Burkes severe depression. He said it really became
               apparent when they had been dating and unable to see each other
               for awhile. He told me she has been cutting on and off. Morales
               said he was concerned because Kagawa-Burke had recently
               purchased new tools to self harm. I asked him how he knew this,
               and he said she told him. Morales told me how she recently gave
               her knife and other cutting tools she used in the past to a
               friend so she could no longer harm herself. I asked Morales if
               Kagawa-Burke has thought about suicide in the past, and he said
               no. Although, he said she talks a lot about not wanting to be
               around. He also said she sometimes sits in cold parking lots
               during hypothermic weather. I asked Morales if he would
               screenshot the text messages between him and Kagawa-Burke and
               email them to me. He told me he would do that. I later received
               an email from Morales with the text message screenshots, and
               they were later uploaded into Spillman. No further action. My
               Vievu camera was activated, although I am unable to download
               the video at this time due to technology issues. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               1st day of March, 2016, in Pullman, Washington.

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: ENW/328 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 15-W1062 SYNOPSIS: Report of a box found in
               an elevator with the words "Run! Run! Run!" and "They will kill
               you!" written on it. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 03/01/16 around 0035 hrs I was dispatched to a
               report of an Amazon.com box found in an elevator of Northside
               Residence Hall with the words "Run! Run! Run!" and "They will
               kill you!" written on it. Upon my arrival I contacted the
               reporting party, later identified as Alexandra J Rivas
               (01/19/96), and told the following. Rivas told me she had been
               contacted by a hall staff member, Jordan Frost, regarding a box
               which was in the elevator of the Northside Residence Hall.
               According to Rivas, Frost had told her the box had been there
               for some time and had the tag ripped off to obscure the
               identity of the recipient. Upon my arrival I contacted Rivas
               and she showed me the box, which had the tag ripped off, but
               showed a delivery to room 505 of the Northside Residence Hall
               upon it. I asked Rivas who lives in that room and was told the
               resident is a male, Justin D Lam Po Tang (10/22/95). After
               taking possession of the box I went to room 505 and found
               Justin's name upon the door with a note. As I looked at the
               note I noticed the writing in the lower part of the note
               resembled the writing on the box I now had in my possession. I
               took a picture of the the note and tried to contact Justin in
               his room. I knocked several times, without a response before I
               cleared and returned to the WSU Police Department. Upon my
               return to the WSU Police Department, I added the photo I had
               taken to this case along with a photos of the box and the
               writing on the back of the box. I later placed the box in a
               temporary evidence locker before completing this report.
               Investigation continues. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 1st day of March,
               2016, in Pullman, Washington.
