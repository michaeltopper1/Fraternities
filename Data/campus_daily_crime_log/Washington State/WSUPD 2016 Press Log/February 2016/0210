               hrs Ofc Petlovany, Ofc Westerman, and I were dispatched to a
               report of a panic alarm at the Dodgen Research Center. As we
               were en route we were given the location of the alarm and told
               there was also a high radiation pool door alarm. Upon our
               arrival we set up a perimeter and a responsible, later
               identified as Christopher C Hines (08/05/82), was contacted.

               Hines. We re-entered the building and determined this alarm was
               also a malfunction. I was also told he would have address the
               issues surrounding this call on 02/11/16. I told him that would
               be fine and cleared a short time later. Nothing further. I

               2. Jesse S. Maiwald/05-06-97 Passenger in car NARRATIVE: On 02-
               10-16 at approximately 2321 hours, I observed a vehicle
               traveling northbound on Stadium Way at Wilson Rd travel through
               an intersection after the light had turned red. I had been
               watching the tires of the vehicle and observed the light turn
               red prior to the vehicle crossing the stop line of the
               intersection. I immediately activated my emergency lights and
               observed the vehicle had already begun to pull over and stop in
               the bus turnout in front of Vogel Hall on Stadium Way. As I
               exited my vehicle, I activated my VieVue camera and approached
               the driver. I advised the driver I was recording the traffic
               stop and the reason for the stop. She stated she understood.
               She and the passenger both admitted they thought the light
               would be yellow longer. As I spoke with the driver, I could
               smell an over whelming odor of marijuana emitting from the
               vehicle. I asked her for her driver's license and she was
               identified as Niaylah Simone King, by her WA Driver's License.
               I observed she was under the age of twenty one. I asked her how
               old she was and she stated 18 years old. I asked her how old
               her passenger was and he stated 18 years old. I asked both of
               them if they were a medical marijuana patient and they both
               stated no. I asked if there was marijuana in the vehicle and
               advised King I could smell it and she stated no. She stated she
               had some in the vehicle earlier, but had not smoked it. I could
               clearly see marijuana stems, part of a joint, and gvm
               throughout the vehicle. I asked King to step out of the vehicle
               and stand on the sidewalk so I could speak with her and she
               did. At this time Ofc. Whitman arrived on scene and I asked him
               if he wanted to take over the DUI portion of the stop and he
               said yes. While Ofc. Whitman asked King to perform SFST's, I
               spoke to the passenger. While speaking with him, I could see
               more gvm in the door handle area as well as in the center
               console. I could also see a small metal tin between his feet,
               which based on my training and experience, is commonly used to
               store marijuana and smoking devices in by users. fc. Whitman
               determined he had probable cause to place King under arrest for
               Minor Operating a Motor Vehicle After Having Consumed Alcohol
