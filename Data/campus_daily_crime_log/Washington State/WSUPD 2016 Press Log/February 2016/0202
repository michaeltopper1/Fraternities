               approximately 1040 hours, I was on routine patrol when I
               noticed a disabled Acura Integra that was stopped on Stadium
               Way near Beasley Coliseum with its flashers on. I contacted the
               driver who identified herself as Darien C. McLaughlin. She told
               me she has been going through car troubles and she believes she
               may have blown a fuse while driving because her car just quit.
               I asked her what fuse she thought the car blew and she pointed
               to a battery fuse. I checked the fuse and it had indeed blown.
               Darien told me she had another fuse, but didn't have any tools
               to replace it. I contacted Ofc. Jones who brought a phillips
               head screw driver. I asked Darien if she had a problem with me
               changing the fuse out and she told me she didn't. I replaced
               the fuse and she was able to start her car and drive away. I
               cleared. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under

               for a report of a "homeless" male looking in dumpsters and
               vehicle windows. I responded and checked the area and was
               unable to locate the subject. As I was exiting the parking
               garage, I briefly asked the parking attendant if she had seen
               the subject and she told me she did. She stated he was older,
               with a long gray beard, and appeared homeless. I advised her to
               call back if she sees him in the future. Case inactive. I

               a while ago but he did not realize she was trying to get ahold
               of him. I told Pope that he might want to call her back. I
               again asked Pope how he was doing and he said everything was

               of marijuana coming from a room in Rogers Hall. Officers
               arrived and both subjects were under the age of 21. They both
               denied smoking marijuana or possessing it, but the odor was

               NARRATIVE: On 02-02-16 at approximately 2327 hours I was
               dispatched to the report of the odor of marijuana coming from
               room #737 in Rogers Hall, located at 1355 SE Olympia Ave. Ofc.
               Whitman and I arrived on scene. The complainant, Ross A.
               McClure (DOB 12-30-86), was the hall director on duty and he
               met us on the 7th floor elevator lobby. McClure told us the
               odor of marijuana was coming from room #737. I could smell the
               strong odor of marijuana just standing in the elevator lobby.
               McClure told me one male was inside the room, and another male
               had walked into the room right as they were calling us. We went
               to room #737. As soon as I walked up a male opened the door,
               and two males both wearing backpacks were leaving the room. The
               males were later identified as Andrew L. Moats (DOB 04-16-97)
               and Richard P. Ramaglia (DOB 04-18-97). I could smell the odor
               of marijuana coming from the room. I asked them if they knew
               why I was there, and Moats said no. I told both of them I was
               audio and video recording. Moats and Ramaglia eye's were
               bloodshot. I asked them how much marijuana was in the room, and
               Ramaglia shook his head from side to side and said "we don't
               have any". I asked them how much marijuana they smoked then,
               and Moats said "I didn't smoke" and Ramaglia shook his head
               side to side. I told Moats and Ramaglia my report was going to
               WSU Student Conduct, and that lying to me would not help their
               case. I told them I could tell they had both been smoking. I
               also told them their room smells like marijuana. I again told
               them to gather up their marijuana. Neither of them said
               anything. I asked for both of their ID's and they provided
               them. I asked them what they had been smoking out of, and Moats
               replied "I didn't smoke tonight", and Ramaglia said he did not
               smoke. Moats and Ramaglia told me they both live in room #737.
               I asked them if random people just come in their room and smoke
               marijuana, and Moats said "no, the doors usually locked". I
               asked if either of them were over age of 21, and they both said
               no. I asked Moats and Ramaglia if either of them had a medical
               marijuana card, and they both said no. The window to their room

               was wide open. I told them their room just happens to smell
               like marijuana, but nobody has been smoking in there. Moats
               replied "I haven't been smoking in there". I asked if they
               would be willing to let me search their room if they don't have
               anything in there. Moats again said "I don't have anything". I
               looked at Ramaglia and asked him if he had anything in the
               room, and he replied "I really don't want you to be searching
               the room, and everything. I don't feel comfortable, but we
               don't have anything". I told Ramaglia that was his right, and
               he could say no. I told both of them I felt it was a little odd
               that their window was open and their room smells like
               marijuana. I asked if they were going to study because they
               were both wearing backpacks. Moats told me he had just gotten
               back from studying at the library. I explained to both of them
               they would be sent to WSU Student Conduct. I told them they
               probably have marijuana in their rooms or in their backpacks, I
               told them they needed to get rid of it. Moats told me he did
               not have any marijuana in his backpack, and that I could look
               in it. He opened up his backpack and started to show me all of
               the compartments. As Moats was doing this his hands were
               shaking badly. I told them smoking in their room is not a smart
               idea, and that opening up their window is not going to help the
               odor. Ofc. Whitman and I cleared the scene. No further action.
               My Vievu camera was activated, and the video was downloaded
               into the permanent digital evidence folder. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of

               near Spokane St. when I observed red, 1992 Ford Tempo (WA Lic.
               AXH6713) broken down on Spokane St. The Ford was stopped at the
               stop sign and was trying to get a jump start from one of their
               coworkers at the time I saw them. The Ford and the other

               was unable to respond, and asked me if I could call her a tow
               truck. I asked Dispatch to send the next rotational tow to our
               location. Once the tow truck arrived, and the Ford was moved, I
               cleared the scene. No further action. My Vievu camera was
               activated, and the video was downloaded into the permanent
               digital evidence folder. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 3rd day of February,
               2016, in Pullman, Washington.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0551 SYNOPSIS: Pullman PD requested an
               agency assist for a suspicious persons call near NW Golden
               Hills Dr. Officers searched area and were unable to locate
               suspicious person. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 02-03-16 at approximately 0445 hours Dispatch
               advised Pullman PD was requesting an agency assist for a call.
               I told them Ofc. Whitman and I were available. Dispatch advised
               it was a report of a suspicious person at trailer #52, located
               at 260 NW Golden Hills Dr. Dispatch said the complainant,
               Roxanne Romero (DOB 10-01-78), had saw someone walking around
               by her car, but then the person disappeared. Dispatch said
               Romero was unable to provide a description of the person. Ofc.
               Whitman and I arrived in the area. We both drove around the
               area, but were unable to locate anyone in the area or around
               trailer #52. I called Romero on the phone. Romero told me she
               is being stalked by a male over in the Seattle area. She told
               me the male put out a hit for her to be killed. I asked her if
               she was able to get a description of anyone by her vehicles,
               but she said no she did not see anyone. She told me she heard
               car doors slam shut and dogs barking, and she got worried. Ofc.
               Whitman walked around her parked vehicles, but were unable to
               locate anyone. I asked Romero if all her doors were locked, and
               she said they were. Ofc. Whitman and I drove around for a few
               more minutes. We both cleared the scene. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               3rd day of February, 2016, in Pullman, Washington.
