               students. Matter sounds civil in nature. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Kevin R. Lindquist 10/21/87 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 02/20/16 at approximately 1230 hours I was
               dispatched to a harassment call at the front of the WSUPD. I
               responded and met with Kevin Lindquist and his mom (I did not
               identify his mom, but I believe she said her name was Nancy)
               out front of the department. I invited them into the interview
               room and told them I was recording. I met with them for an hour
               and a half and learned the following. When we sat down Nancy
               went into explaining why Kevin was there. Nancy told me how
               back in August of 2015 Kevin was assaulted by his roommate.
               Nancy said that ever since then Kevin has been retaliated
               against and is being harassed by social media. Nancy said that
               lies are being spread about Kevin and they think that it all
               stems from the original assault. Nancy said that Kevin is being
               dropped from different organizations, but that no one will come
               out and say why they are dropping him. Nancy said that Kevin
               was told to come to the police by his advisors. I asked Kevin
               to explain why he was there. Kevin began to explain about his
               recent candidacy for ASWSU President and how he had to drop his
               candidacy because his partner (Nikki) mysteriously backed out.
               Kevin went on to explain more about the candidacy and how he
               filed an election violation against Zach Shariff. Kevin
               explained his theory of how the whole Greek system is against
               him and he showed me a flow chart he had created to better
               explain. Kevin explained how his ex-roommate, Dylan, was a
               member of the TKE house. Kevin said that since Dylan assaulted
               him and was arrested all members of the TKE house hate him and
               that it has spread through out the Greek system. Kevin
               explained how Nikki is in a sorority and that her sorority
               president supports Shariff and that had something to do with
               Nikki dropping the candidacy. Kevin further told me how his
               Chief of Staff, Fadumo, had posted his (Kevin's) and Nikki's
               resignation letter on their (Kevin and Nikki) Facebook page
               after he told her not to do so. Kevin said that he wanted to be
               the one to announce it. Kevin showed me a message between
               Fadumo and him that showed the resignation letter and Kevin
               responded "Hold off on that for now". Kevin said that Fadumo
               posted it anyway and Kevin (as an administrator of the page)
               deleted it. Kevin said Fadumo then reposted it, but deleted it
               later. Kevin said that he did not know for sure that Fadumo
               posted it, but assumed that since she was the one who presented

               it to him. I took photos of the message and Kevin emailed it to
               me as well. Kevin told me about other issues he has had with
               the Interfraternity Council (IFC), random sorority girls
               staring at him and making comments, Delta Chi dropping him from
               the house for an undisclosed reason, and Nikki not paying for
               her half of the candidacy. I explained to Kevin that I agreed
               his situation was unfortunate, but I did not think there were
               any criminal acts that occurred. I told him that I could look
               into the Facebook posting if he wanted me to do so. I later
               researched any applicable Washington RCW, but could not locate
               one that makes what Fadumo allegedly did a criminal act. Kevin
               explained that he does not feel he is getting any support from
               other areas within the University, as he has previously spoken
               with Karen Fischer (Associate Dean of Students) and Brian
               Shuffield (Executive Director of Student Involvement) about his
               problems and nothing has happened. I told Kevin I would send an
               email to Adam Jussel, Karen Fischer, and Brian Sheffield so
               that they might be able to come together and meet with him to
               find a resolution. I sent said email and Fischer responded that
               she already had an appointment scheduled with Kevin on Monday
               at 1500 hours. I do not know the full information for Nikki,
               Zach, or Fadumo, so I did not enter them into involvements. At
               this time there are no criminal acts and I feel this case is
               better handled by other University departments. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               21st day of February, 2016, in Pullman, Washington.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0874 SYNOPSIS: Subject contacted in
               parking lot. Subsequently he produced brass knuckles and
               admitted to smoking marijuana. His friend showed up and was
               MIP. Refer to Student Conduct. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE

               Exhibiting 2. Pedro C. Diaz (092296) Conduct Dangerous Weapon &
               Marijuana NARRATIVE: On 022116 at approximately 0019 hours I
               drove into the Green parking lot next to the President's
               Residence when I observed a male just sitting in a vehicle. It
               was not running and it was approximately 33 degrees. I parked
               my car a ways away from the vehicle and walked up to the
               driver's side. I said hello to Pedro C. Diaz (092296) and asked
               if everything was okay. He said it was and he was waiting on
               his friend who was inside a nearby Fraternity House (Delta Tau
               Delta). Then he said he was probably going to go inside. This
               seemed odd. I could smell the odor of marijuana and Diaz
               appeared to be under 21. He confirmed he was 19. He was wearing
               a jacket that appeared to be a High School Letterman's jacket
               and he said it was just a gift. He offered his identification
               to me and I accepted it. Diaz told me he was the sober driver
               for the night. I told him I could smell the odor of marijuana
               coming from the car. He did not sound too alarmed. He denied
               smoking marijuana. I told him I did not believe him and asked
               if he had anything he was not supposed to. He responded "On me?
               Nothing, you can check the car". I had him exit the vehicle and
               instructed him to keep his hands out of his pockets. I then
               asked if he had any weapons on him and he informed me he had
               brass knuckles in his jacket. I retrieved them and then patted
               him down for more weapons. I then confirmed with him that I
               could search his vehicle and informed he could restrict,
               revoke, and refuse that consent. He said I could search the
               car. Sgt. Griffin arrived as backup. I began searching the
               vehicle when shortly after Nathan T. Gordon (070797) arrived
               and stated the black backpack in the car was his and he did not
               consent to it being searched. I had just put my hand in the bag
               and stopped. I then continued searching the rest of the
               vehicle. I then spoke with Diaz who offered to walk home if I
               preferred. I told him I believed he had been smoking and he
               confessed he had smoked marijuana at about 2100 hours. I
               informed him that his brass knuckles were illegal and that I
               would be keeping them. I told him since he had been cooperative
               I would only be referring him to Student Conduct. The vehicle
               had not been running and he was safely off the road way. I then

               went and spoke with Gordon who I knew from previous
               interactions. I could smell the odor of alcohol on his breath
               and I knew him to be under 21. He slurred some words, made
               repetitive and illogical statements. He would not grant consent
               to search his backpack. He said a fraternity brother had given
               him a container that he was not to open and was to take
               straight to his residence hall. Gordon said he did not want to
               "rat out" his fraternity brother. I told him I did not know who
               the brother was and that as long as whatever was in the
               container was not a felony, it would just be disposed of. He
               said he did not know what was inside. I told him I would not
               ask his brother's name, but then Gordon stated he knew the
               brother's Cougar Card was inside the container. No consent was
               given. Gordon provided a breath sample for my PBT of .050 and
               he admitted to drinking one 40 oz of malt liquor. I told him he
               was free to leave. Diaz was still present and I instructed he
               would be wise to have Gordon get his backpack out of his
               vehicle. We cleared. The vehicle's plate was not captured and
               dispatch was unable to find one in DAPS. I believe it was a
               green Toyota 4Runner. Nothing follows. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               21st day of February, 2016, in Pullman, Washington.

               driving northbound on Orchard Dr. near the Student Rec. Center
               when I noticed a female, later identified as Bailee R. Syrek
               (032695), who was walking northbound along Orchard Dr. She
               caught my attention because she appeared to be under 21 and was
               having great difficulty walking. She was stumbling side to side
               and her head was wobbling side to side as she walked. She had
               her arms extended out to her sides at times for balance. It was
               very clear Syrek was intoxicated. Syrek appeared to be under
               21. I stopped at the student rec center and contacted Syrek.
               She told me she was going home to Providence Court. Syrek spoke
               with slurred speech and I could smell a very strong odor of
               intoxicants on her breath as she spoke. She had bloodshot and
               watery eyes. I noticed a male who had been walking on the
               opposite side of the street from Syrek stopped when I contacted
               Syrek. I asked Syrek if she knew the male, later identified as
               Evan M. Lanphear (091192). Initially she said no but she later
               said he was her boyfriend and they lived together. I thought it
               was odd they were walking on opposite sides of the street but
               they both said everything was ok and they had not been fighting
               or in any argument. I told Syrek I would be forwarding charges
               to the prosecutor's office for MIP Exhibiting. Nothing further.

               hours I observed a group carrying Zachary M. Prybell (022697)
               by the shoulders along Orchard Dr, next to Beasley. I parked at
               Flag Ln and walked towards the group. Cpl. Boyd was there with
               Intern Scheetz to back me up. As I approached the group I could
               see that Prybell needed significant assistance walking and
               appeared to be under the age of 21. His clothes were disheveled
               and he had liquid stains on his shirt and pants. He needed
               support while standing and swayed. It was difficult to get him
               to give an accurate name and birth date. He slurred his speech.
               His eyes were watery and bloodshot. I could smell the odor of
               intoxicants on his breath and he stated he had been drinking
               rum. He provided a breath sample on Cpl. Boyd's PBT of .237.
               Prybell was able to tell me where he was and who the President
               was. His friends with him were significantly more sober and
               were going to look after him. Travis T. Clifford (052397) said

               Warend Theft 2. NARRATIVE: On 02/21/16 at about 0142 hrs
               Dispatch advised hall staff at Community Duncan Dunn hall were
               reporting a subject who took a fire extinguisher from it's case
               and was running around the building with it. The extinguisher
               was later recovered and the suspect ran away. There was a delay
               of approximately 10-15 minutes from the last time the suspect
               was seen. I contacted the complainant, Katherine A.J. Lomeli
               (071594), who told me she received a report that a resident,
               Kyler J. Kirkpatrick (080796), was intoxicated and decided he
               wanted to "play with a fire extinguisher". She was told he
               removed a fire extinguisher from its case and was running
               around in the dorm with it. Lomeli later found Kirkpatrick in
               the dorm carrying a fire extinguisher. When he was confronted
               he dropped the extinguisher and ran out of the building. He was
               last seen running toward greek row approximately 10-15 minutes
               prior to the report being made. The fire extinguisher was not
               damaged or discharged nor was any damage caused to the case.
               The extinguisher was returned to its case. I told Lomeli that
               because of the time delay I would attempt to contact
               Kirkpatrick the following night when I returned to work. I told
               her since the fire extinguisher was recovered and nothing was
               damaged I would issue Kirkpatrick a warning for theft. More to
               follow. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 21 day of February, 2016, in Pullman,
               Washington. _______________________________________ Officer

               NARRATIVE: On 022116 at approximately 0209 hours I was
               dispatched to the report that hall staff had found people
               smoking marijuana in their room at Perham 630. Cpl. Boyd,
               Intern Scheetz, I responded and hall staff were at the open
               door of Perham 630. The odor of marijuana was strong. The room
               belonged to Matthew J. Johnson (100997) and Jonathan A. Glennie

               when they were smoking. Both males had very bloodshot eyes and
               said they were about a "6" when asked how high they were on a
               scale of 1-10, 10 being highest. I instructed them to get
               everything they were not supposed to have and they retrieved 2
               bongs and about 15 grams of marijuana. They disposed of
               everything except one bong which Glennie took to his car parked
               off campus. They were all warned. Only the males are WSU
               Students and will be referred to Student Conduct. The females
               do not attend another school. Hall staff was provided with the
               case number and we cleared. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 21st day of February,
