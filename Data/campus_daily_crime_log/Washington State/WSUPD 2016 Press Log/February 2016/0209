               at approximately 1042 hours, I was dispatched to Lighty Student
               Services regarding a theft. Upon arrival, I contacted Bhagi R.
               Biswa who told me the following. On 020816 at approximately
               1200 hours, she had been studying in the 2nd floor hallway of
               Eastlick Hall when she decided to get up and contact her
               professor with a question. Biswa told me she left her backpack
               on the floor of the hallway and went to her professor's office.
               Biswa told me at approximately 1220 hours, she returned to
               where she left her backpack and it was gone. She told me her
               backpack was a Dakine multi-colored backpack and was valued at
               $45.00. Inside her backpack had her leather purse ($50.00)
               which was yellow with flowers and contained her WADL, Green
               Card, Debit Card, $30.00 US Currency and some notebooks for her
               chemistry class. Biswa told me she has no idea who may have
               taken her backpack. I responded to Eastlick Hall and contacted
               the custodian who identified herself as Jolanda A. Whitacre.
               Whitacre told me she would keep her eye out for the backpack
               and contact me if she found it in any trash cans or the main
               dumpster. Whitacre also told me to check lost and found in
               Ableson room 312. I responded there and the receptionist told
               me the backpack wasn't turned in. Case inactive pending further

               regarding a welfare check. Dispatch advised Adam Jussel at WSU
               Student Conduct reported that Yadav sent an email on 020816 at
               approximately 1521 hours. In the email he states, "On a
               personal note i just feel like killing myself done with life
               because 2 years may be wasted." Ofc. Jones and I responded to
               V301 in Steptoe Apartments and Yadav was not home. We returned
               at approximately 1500 hours, and contacted Yadav who answered
               the door. I asked him how he was doing and he told me he was
               doing okay. I asked him if he was having thoughts about hurting
               himself and he told me he wasn't. He explained that he sent the
               email because he was upset about the situation between him and
               some of his professors, but he doesn't want to actually kill
               himself. Based on my conversation with Yadav, there wasn't
               probable cause to warrant protective custody. Yadav told me he
               was eating and has stopped taking "Spice." Yadav incidated he
               was trying to get his life turned around. Ofc. Jones and I
               agreed that he satisfied our concerns for his welfare and we
               cleared. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0650 SYNOPSIS: CUB info desk turned over
               a found Lenovo Laptop. Email was sent to owner. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 02/09/16 at
               approximately 1617 hours I was dispatched to a found property
               call at the CUB. I walked over to the CUB info desk where they
               had a Levono ThinkPad laptop. The CUB employee stated that
               someone had turned in the laptop and it was found on the ground
               floor of the CUB. On the backside of the laptop I found a
               "Shenzhun University" sticker. The sticker had Chinese witting
               on it. I found a student in the CUB who translated the writing.
               The Chinese writing had the owner's name on it. The name
               written in Chinese was "Yu Jai Li." When I was leaving the CUB,
               a CUB staff member stated the owner of the laptop just called
               and the staff member instructed them to contact me at the
               Police Station. Once back at the station I found a Yu J. Li
               03/25/94 in the WSU directory. I attempted to call the phone
               number listed but it was not an active number. In the directory
               Li's address is listed as 1142 NE Markley Dr., #2. I went to
               Li's apartment several times but nobody was home. I also sent
               an email to Li about her laptop. As of 0200 on 02/10/16 Li has
               not contacted me about her laptop. The laptop was placed into
               evidence as found property. END OF REPORT I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               10th day of February, 2016, in Pullman, Washington.

               warrant off a traffic stop. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Bailey R. Short 01/06/80 Booked Warrant Arrest
               2. NARRATIVE: On 02/09/16 at approximately 2200 hours I was
               driving westbound on Terre View near Palouse Ridge when I
               noticed the car in front of me had defective brake lights. The
               driver's side brake light was stuck in the brake mode and the
               high center mounted brake light was not functioning. I
               initiated a traffic stop at Terre View and the Cougar Ridge
               Apartment Complex. I contacted the driver, Bailey R. Short
               01/06/80, identified myself, informed Short I was recording,
               and explained the reason for the stop. I asked for Short's
               driver's license and Short stated she had forgot her wallet at
               home. Short was only able to provide her vehicle registration
               since her proof of insurance was also in her wallet. Short
               provided her name and date of birth verbally. I returned to my
               patrol car and ran Short through dispatch. Dispatch stated
               Short's driving status was clear however she had a misdemeanor
               warrant for her arrest out of Kennewick. Dispatch provided me
               with Short's last four digits of her social security number. I
               returned to Short and asked what the last four digits of her
               SSN was. Short provided the same numbers that dispatch had
               provided. I asked Short if she would talk to me on the
               sidewalk. Once out of the car I asked Short about her contacts
               with Kennewick PD. Short stated she had been arrested for theft
               off a welfare fraud case. Short stated her case was over and
               she had to spend two days in jail and pay $500 dollars in
               fines. Short stated she already did her two days but had not
               paid her fines yet. I told Short that it appeared Kennewick had
               issued a warrant for her arrest due to her not paying her court
               fines. I placed Short under arrest and handcuffed her. Short
               stated she had a dog in her car and did not know what to do
               about it. After making several calls Short was able to get her
               sister to come and pick up the dog. Once the dog was in Short's
               sisters custody, I transported Short to the Whitman County
               Jail. Once at the Jail I read Short a copy of the warrant. Once
               the warrant was read I turned Short over to the jail staff and
               cleared. Short was warned for no license on person and no proof
               of insurance. END OF REPORT I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 10th day of February,
               2016, in Pullman, Washington.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0656 SYNOPSIS: Report of the odor of
               marijuana. Subject contacted and referred to Student Conduct.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Zylstra, Rachel A
               (12/16/96) Warned Possession of MJ 2. NARRATIVE: On 02/09/16
               around 2325 hrs I was dispatched to room 46 of Regents Hall for
               the odor of marijuana. Upon my arrival I contacted a member of
               hall staff, who was not identified, and led to room 486. While
               en route to the room I asked if there had been any previous
               incidents with the room and told there have been other
               contacts, but she was not sure when. As I walked down the
               hallway towards room 486 I noticed the odor of marijuana in the
               hallway in several spots prior to reaching the room. After
               arriving at the room I listened at the door and could not hear
               any movement inside. I smelled around the crack of the door and
               noticed an odor of what I believed to be burnt marijuana and
               knocked. The door was answered by a female, later identified as
               Rachel A Zylstra (12/16/96), and after asking her if she knew
               why I was there she asked me to come into the room. Once inside
               of the room Zylstra told me she didn't know why I was there and
               I explained it was for the odor of marijuana coming from the
               room. Initially she denied having any involvement and we
               discussed this for a short period of time. Zylstra explained
               she was nervous and admitted to having a pipe which she used to
               smoke from, but denied having smoked in the room, or prior to
               my arrival. I asked Zylstra where her pipe was and as she
               pulled it from a backpack sitting on the floor of the opposite
               side of the room I noticed the odor of burnt marijuana grow
               stronger. Around this point we discussed several options and
               she told me she would like to voluntarily destroy the pipe she
               had. I told her that would be fine and this case would be
               forwarded to student conduct. A short time later we walked to
               the dumpster located outside of the building where she
               destroyed and threw away the pipe before we returned to the
               building. After arriving back on the 4th floor I spoke with
               hall staff and provided them with the case number and explained
               Zylstra had been cooperative with me throughout the contact
               before clearing. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 9th day of
               February, 2016, in Pullman, Washington.
