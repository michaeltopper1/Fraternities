    Narrative: RVWD:MTK OFC: JAK/333 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0969 SYNOPSIS: A WSU employee wanted
               advise on how to remain safe from possible retaliation from an
               Associate Professor. I provided her with both Law Enforcement
               and University resources. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR#
               1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 02-26-16, I was assigned an "Others Call"
               from Whitcom and asked to make phone contact with the reporting
               party, Susan M. Lewis (02-08-76). I called Lewis and asked what
               I could do for her. Lewis stated she works for the WSU
               Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering in Pullman,
               Washington as a Program Specialist 2. She said she works as the
               Research Administrator for the TRAC (Washington State
               Transportation Research Center). Lewis stated preparing Grant
               Budgets is one of her main duties. In order to do this
               effectively, she needs to ask a lot of questions. One of the
               people Lewis works with a lot is Dr. Haifang (Harry) Wen (07-
               02-74). She said there have been many times when Wen would
               become angry with Lewis because she asked so many questions
               pertaining to Grants. Lewis would explain to Wen why she needed
               to ask all of the questions, but he did not like it. Lewis said
               Wen never actually threatened her, but said he was often
               frustrated by her questions. On 02-15-16, Wen was arrested for
               allegedly defrauding the US Government out of approximately $8
               Million in Grant Money. According to a press release from the
               US Attorney, Wen, his Brother and Sister In Law allegedly set
               up bank accounts for private companies under their control in
               the towns of Horseheads and Elmira in New York. The Wens
               allegedly fabricated Grant Proposals claiming they were
               developing asphalt composition technologies. Wen was released
               without bond following his first appearance in Federal Court on
               02-25-16 in Spokane, Washington. His next court appearance is
               scheduled for 03-04-16 in New York. Lewis said she is fearful
               of what Wen must be feeling and how he may act toward her as
               she asked so many questions for Wen's Grant Proposals. She was
               trying to find out if Wen was still employed with WSU and if he
               still had access to Sloan Hall. Lewis said she was worried Wen
               may feel like he has been backed into a corner and was not sure
               how he may react. She said it is sad to say, but it is
               instances like this where people "Go Postal". She re-iterated
               Wen had never threatened her, but she is now fearful of how he
               may react to her. I told Lewis I would do some research and get
               back to her. I made contact with Lisa M. Gehring, who works for
               WSU Human Resources and relayed what Lewis had discussed with
               me. She said she was not sure what Wen's employment status was

               or his access to sloan Hall. She said she would do some
               research of her own, contact Lewis, then contact me to let me
               know she found out. After I contacted Gehring, I contacted Dr.
               Balasingam Mahunthan (09-08-61), who is the Chair for the WSU
               Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. I explained
               what concerns Lewis had. Mahunthan said he actually had a face
               to face conversation with Wen on the evening of 02-25-16.
               Mahunthan said Wen's concerns were clearing his name and how
               his Graduate Students would perceive him. Mahunthan said he is
               aware of how many times Wen expressed concern about how many
               questions Lewis always asked Wen, but said he supports her
               fully in her questioning Wen. He said it was these types of
               incidents where it is extremely important to be thorough.
               Mahunthan said he would speak with Lewis's supervisor to see if
               it would be possible to have her work from home if that would
               make her feel better. He ended the conversation by saying he
               had advised Wen to take a few days off so he could figure
               things out and did not expect him in the office for several
               days. He also said at this time, Wen was still employed with
               WSU and had full access to Sloan Hall. I called Lewis back and
               told her what I had learned. She said she had already heard
               from Gehring and understood what options she had through the
               University. I then told Lewis she had the option of applying
               for an Order for Protection and explained how she could do so.
               I ended our conversation by telling her she should call 911 if
               she felt she needed to. Nothing further at this time. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.
               Dated this 26th day of February, 2016, in Pullman, Washington.

               On 022616 at approximately 1239 hours, I was dispatched to a

               told me I wasn't at the right elevator. I asked an employee in
               the building how many elevators there are in the IT Building
               and was told only one, but that the WSU Football Pressbox also
               geobases as the same address. I checked all 5 elevators in the
               WSU Football Pressbox and dispatch advised that none of them
               matched the elevator alarm they received. Dispatch also told me

               Resident Advisor for Stephenson South, Tiffany J. Firestone
               (09-05-91). While I was on the phone with Firestone, Corporal

               the room and we had not. I asked Firestone to inform me what
               was going on. She said she was walking the hallway on the 10th
               floor of Stephenson South and smelled a faint odor of
               marijuana. She said she walked the hallway and the odor of
               marijuana became slightly stronger near room 1017. She said she
               placed her nose in the crack of the door of room 1017 and said
               she was sure the odor was emitting from within the room. As we
               were talking on the phone she said a male left the room and
               there was no one left inside the room. I asked her to rate the
               odor of what she smelled emitting from within the room to that
               of marijuana. I asked her to use a scale from 1 to 10 with 10
               being she was sure the odor was that of marijuana. She said she
               thought the odor may have been from old (not new) marijuana,
               but she said she would rate the odor as an 8. I asked her to
               use the same scale and rate that the odor was emitting from
               within room 1017. She said she was sure and gave the rate of
               10. She said she did not want me to waste my time by responding
               to the room as she was sure no one was inside. She said she
               just wanted to document the information. I did not respond to
               the room. Nothing further at this time. I certify and declare

               as Austin Marshall Proteau 04/29/97, I noticed Proteau was
               unsteady on his feet as he walked. I told Proteau to stop and
               he did. Proteau appeared to be in a daze and I told him to sit
               down. I ask Proteau what was going on and Proteau began to tell

               mental status. Proteau was able to answer all my questions
               correctly. Once medics arrived they evaluated Proteau and
               determined that he did not need to go to the hospital. I told
               Proteau that I would be referring him to student conduct for
               being intoxicated in public while under age. Proteau had a few

               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 02-26-16 I was on patrol when
               I saw a vehicle, WA/Lic AYL4788, parked in the bus turnout on
               Stadium Way at Vogel. I pulled my patrol car behind it and
               exited. I contacted the driver a Hongbo Wang. While speaking to
               Wang I saw both passenger side tires on the vehicle were flat.
               I looked at the driver side and the rear tire was flat also. I
               asked Wang what had happen. He stated that he drove off a curb
               and then the car started driving funny. I asked him where it
               had happen, but he didn't know. I asked if it was on campus and
               he said he didn't know. The marks on the tires were consistent
               with him driving off a curb. I checked the rest of the vehicle
               and there was no damage. I have no evidence that this was a
               collision. Wang spoke very broken English and it was extremely
               hard to under stand. I looked at the tires and could see marks
               on the sidewalls consistent with his story. I asked him if he
               needed a help changing the tires or a tow. He handed me his
               insurance information and pointed to the 1-800 number for
               roadside assistance. I called the number and the company
               suggested he speak with an interpreter from the company. I
               handed the phone to Wang and he spoke to someone for about 15
               minutes. When he got off the phone he said they were sending
               help. At that time Wang's roommate arrived. He spoke very good
               English. I had him tell Wang that if he didn't get a tow with
               in the hour to call and I would send one. He said that was
               fine. I did not identify the roommate. I cleared the scene and
               about an hour later the vehicle was gone. Nothing
               further............. I certify and declare under penalty of

               CASE #: 16-W0987 SYNOPSIS: Report of a vehicle prowl in the
               Blue 1 lot which occurred sometime the previous two days. No
               suspects or leads. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 02/26/16 at about 2212 hrs Dispatch advised of a
               subject reporting his car was broken into and several items
               stolen. I responded and contacted the vehicle owner, Moises B.
               Solis (030697), who told me he parked his vehicle on 02/24/16.
               When he returned to his vehicle he noticed the stereo had been
               stolen. None of the windows in the vehicle were broken and
               there was no apparent forced entry. Solis said the vehicle was
               locked. I told him it was likely the suspects used shaved honda
               keys to unlock his vehicle and steal the stereo. Solis said
               after checking his vehicle he found the following items were
               stolen: 1. Battery valued at approx $100 2. Radiator Hose
               valued at approximately $25 3. After market air intake (unknown
               brand) valued at approximately $100 4. Alpine Stereo
               model#CDE151 valued at $110 5. JBL Subwoofer w/amplifier valued
               at $400 Solis told me he had seen several posts online
               regarding other people having items stolen from their vehicles
               in the same parking lot. I told him I was not aware of any
               reported vehicle prowls but that I would look into it and
               request officers perform extra patrols of the parking lot for a
               while. I provided Solis with my business card and the case
               number. Officer Whitman and I checked the rest of the parking
               lot. We located one vehicle (WA ADK0561) that had a missing
               stereo. I attempted to contact the student associated with the
               vehicle, Brendon J. Hartshorn (020294), but was unable to do
               so. I left my business card on the vehicle requesting he
               contact me and also left a voice mail message at his parent's
               phone number requesting they have him call me so I could
               determine if the vehicle was broken into. After returning to
               the WSU Police Station I checked Spillman and found no similar
               vehicle prowl's reported in the previous month. No suspects or
               leads at this time. I have yet to hear back from Hartshorn.
               More to follow. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 27 day of February, 2016, in

               MIP-Exhibiting on Bailey N. Hooghkirk. Refer to Student
               Conduct. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Bailey N.
               Hooghkirk (091997) Forward MIP-Exhibiting 2. NARRATIVE: On
               022616 at approximately 2340 hours I was driving southbound on
               Veteran's Way, near Goertzen Hall, when I observed Elena L.
               Borne (042497) assisting Bailey N. Hooghkirk (091997) as she
               walked. Borne held Hooghkirk's arm and she still had difficulty
               walking straight. There was an unidentified male with them. I
               stopped my vehicle and walked towards them. As I got closer, I
               could smell the odor of intoxicants coming from the group. I
               was then able to observe that they all appeared to be under the
               age of 21. I instructed them to stop and they did so.
               Hooghkirk's shirt was disheveled and she had watery and
               bloodshot eyes. I could smell the odor of intoxicants on her
               breath when she spoke. She said she had drank beer and was a
               "3" on a scale of 1-10 regarding intoxication. She confirmed
               she was 18 and she gave me her name. I requested she provide a
               breath sample for my PBT and she declined and told me she was
               going to leave. I informed her she was being detained.
               Hooghkirk was aware of her location and who the President was.
               She did state it was November 25th. I clarified November and
               she said yes. Houghkirk said she could call the Police. I
               informed her I was the Police. She said she was free to leave
               and she was told she was not. Hooghkirk refused to provide
               identification or provide her date of birth. I placed her under
               arrest for MIP-Exhibiting. She was placed in handcuffs and
               informed of her right to counsel and that we were being
               recorded. Ofc. Westerman and Intern Hammer had arrived as
               backup. Ofc. Westerman looked Hooghkirk up in myWSU while
               Hammer searched Hooghkirk incident to arrest. The last name
               Hooghkirk had provided sounded like "Hooker", which may have
               been just due to her intoxication rather than trying to provide
               a false name. I spoke with Borne who did not want to confirm
               Hooghkirk's identity. Ofc. Westerman found Hooghkirk in the
               system and her identity was confirmed with her WSU picture. I
               explained to Hooghkirk that I would be forwarding charges to
               the Prosecutor for MIP-Exhibiting. She asked what she had done
               though I had already explained to her that she had been a minor
               in a public place that was exhibiting the effects of having
               consumed alcohol. She would keep repeating she had not done
               anything. Hooghkirk was released and Borne agreed to look after
               Hooghkirk. We cleared. Nothing follows. I certify and declare

               On 02/27/16 at approximately 0015 hours I was driving across
               Library Road when I used my vehicle mounted spot light to
               illuminate the roof of Kimbrough Hall. I noticed two people
               laying down on the northeast corner of the roof. Sgt. Griffin
               arrived and watched the area that the people could climb down
               and Intern Hammer and I went up to the roof. Once on the roof I
               found Gunnar C. Seefeld 09/08/94 and Kendall N. Myers 04/12/96
               laying down. I asked the two what they were doing and Myers
               said they came up to the roof for the view. I told the two they
               were not allowed to climb onto building that they did not own
               and that they both were under arrest for Criminal Trespassing.
               Both were advised they were being audio and video recorded.
               Myers and Seefeld were both escorted off the roof and we walked
               to my patrol car. Once at my patrol car I filled out and issued
               each person a Sector citation for Criminal Trespassing in the
               2nd Degree. I explained the citation to each person and
               provided them with their copies. I told both that I had given
               warnings for trespassing on the roof for several years however
               it did not seem to deter people from going up there. I have
               found 8 people in the last 7 days trespassing on the Kimbrough
               roof. END OF REPORT I certify and declare under penalty of

               hours I was dispatched to a harassment call at Perham Hall room
               231. An RA was reporting a racial slur written on a dry erase
               board on the door to room 231. I responded and photographed the
               markings. Someone had written the word "niggers" with a dry
               erase marker that was attached to the door. I contacted the
               occupant of the room, Spencer Mead and asked if he knew who
               wrote the word on his door. He said he did not. I asked if he
               felt threatened by someone writing that on his door, he said he
               did not. Mead said he and his roommate are not African
               American. Mead erased the slur and it came off without
               difficulty. I told him to tell his RA or call the police if
               this behavior continued. Nothing further. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               27th day of February, 2016, in Pullman, Washington.

    Narrative: RVWD: Boyd/335 OFC: Whitman / 323 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY
               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0998 SYNOPSIS: Report of a
               disabled vehicle on Stadium Way near Gannon Hall. Subject and a
               friend were able to change tire and move the vehicle. Nothing
               further. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 02/27/16 at about 0240 hours dispatch advised there was a
               disabled vehicle on Stadium Way near Gannon Hall. I responded
               and found the owner of the vehicle, Daniel Garcia, and his
               friend, Oliver Billon, changing the tire on Garcia's vehicle.
               Garcia said he wanted to find the hub cap to his vehicle that
               was back in the roadway. As I talked to Garcia I could smell an
               odor of intoxicants coming from him. We walked back up Stadium
               Way about 50 yards and found his hub cap. I asked Garcia if he
               would take a preliminary breath test to see what his alcohol
               level was. I told him if his level was above the legal limit he
               would not be allowed to drive his vehicle, and he could get a
               ride home with his friend. Garcia said he would take the test.
               His PBT reading was .124. I then asked Billon if he had been
               drinking, he said he had. I asked if he would take a PBT and he
               said he would. His PBT reading was .041. Billon completed
               changing the tire on Garica's vehicle and parked it safely off
               of the roadway. He then returned to his vehicle and gave Garcia
               a ride home. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 27th day of
               February, 2016, in Pullman, Washington.
