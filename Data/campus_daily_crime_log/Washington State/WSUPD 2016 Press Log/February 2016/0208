               We located the patient in the men's restroom near the

               patient was able to clear the airway obstruction on his own. He

               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0635 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched
               to a juvenile problem at the Washington Building. A child with
               mental health issues was having a tantrum. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 02-08-2016 at about
               1738 hrs I was dispatched to a report of a juvenile problem
               outside the Washington Building, located at 1125 SE Washington
               Street. Dispatch advised that they had received multiple
               complainants of a child screaming in the area. Officer Welter,
               Assistant Chief Hansen, and I arrived on scene and checked the
               area. Witnesses in the area approached me and said they had
               observed a male sitting on the ground on the east side of the
               building. I contacted the male and saw that he was holding a
               child on his lap and in an embrace. The male was identified as
               Bernard R. Hall (DOB 08-17-1976). Bernard was the father of the
               child, who was identified as Caleb I. Hall (DOB 07-31-2007).
               Caleb was 8 years old. I spoke with Bernard and was told the
               following: Bernard had been picking up some medication at the
               Health and Wellness Center, and Caleb became upset when they
               started to leave. Caleb has mental health issues and had a
               tantrum. Caleb began to scream and ran around the building
               while Bernard was chasing him. Bernard caught Caleb and was
               holding him in an embrace to help calm him down. Caleb had a
               similar incident at the Palouse River Counseling Center, see
               case #16-P01150. I checked Caleb, and he did not appear to be
               injured. Bernard advised that no medical assistance was needed,
               and told me he has an appointment to take Caleb to Palouse
               Pediatrics tomorrow. Officer Welter and I accompanied Bernard
               and Caleb to their nearby vehicle, and they left the area
               without further incident. My Vievu camera was activated during
               this incident. For more information, see the video, which has
               been downloaded into the permanent digital evidence file. No
               crime had occurred. No further action at this time.

               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Topaz, Matthew D
               (05/19/97) Warned Harassment 2. NARRATIVE: On 02/08/16 around
               1751 hrs I was dispatched to the 7th floor lounge of Stephenson
               East for a reported harassment which had occurred around 2300
               hrs on 02/07/16. Ofc Olmstead also responded and upon our
               arrival we were contacted by a female, later identified as
               Nicole L Breting (08/17/96) on our way to the 7th floor lounge.
               Breting explained we were there to speak with her and were
               eventually told the following. Breting explained on the night
               of 02/06/16 she had been at a party where she had come into
               contact with an individual she identified as Mason, later
               identified as Mason O Hart (07/12/97). During the course of
               this conversation she told us she had told Hart a mutual
               friend, later identified as Matthew D Topaz (05/19/97), did not
               like him. She went on to explain to Hart the reason Topaz did
               not like him was how he treated a female name Stephanie.
               Breting went on to tell us she later left the location where
               this conversation had taken place and returned to Stephenson
               East where she spoke with a female, later identified as Mary M
               O'Neal (07/18/97), regarding what she had said. Following this
               conversation O'Neal went and spoke with Topaz regarding what
               had been said and had reportedly become upset over what she had
               said. On 02/07/16 Breting spoke with O'Neal and asked what she
               should do to resolve the situation and was told she needed to
               speak with Topaz which she told us she later did. During this
               conversation, which was described to have taken place in the
               7th floor lounge she told us she had spoken with Topaz about
               what she had said. She went on to tell us Topaz had become
               upset and had threatened to kill her. When asked about this
               comment and why she had delayed in reporting it she later told
               us she just wanted the situation documented, but did not want
               any legal action, due to Topaz's violent outburst, and his
               having struck another female previously. As we continued to
               speak Breting was again about just documenting the situation
               and having no legal action taken. She told us she was moving to
               a new room and again explained she simple wanted the situation
               documented. I told her I would contact Topaz regarding this
               incident and speak with him before contacting her again.
               Following our conversation Olmstead and I attempted to contact
               Topaz in his room. I left my business card with his roommate
               and asked him to have Topaz call me upon his return, which he

               told me he would. I also obtained Topaz's cell phone number,
               which I used to contact him after Olmstead and I had cleared.
               Upon reaching him, Topaz agreed to meet with me and I was told
               the following. Initially Topaz believed I wanted to speak with
               him regarding another incident, which after being corrected
               told me the following. Topaz explained he had been made aware
               of Breting speaking with Hart regarding how he disliked him and
               why. He went on to say he had become upset and made a comment
               to the effect she needed to stay out of his life and not
               concern herself with issues not related to her. This
               conversation took place with O'Neal, after which he left the
               area. On 02/07/16 he was contacted and asked to speak with
               Breting, which he agreed to. He told me this conversation took
               place in the 7th floor lounge during which he explained to
               Breting why he was upset. He continued and told her she owed
               him an apology for what she had done. Around this point another
               resident and mutual friend, later identified as Kelsey M Rogers
               (04/30/97) walked by the open door to the lounge. According to
               Topaz, Rogers had stopped in the doorway and made a joke
               towards him about not killing Breting. At this point Topaz
               explained he had responded sarcastically in the direction of
               Breting stating something to the effect of he was going to kill
               her. He continued and told me the conversation went on for some
               time before both he and Breting left. I asked him if he had
               contact information for both O'Neal, and Rogers, which he did.
               He attempted to contact Rogers by phone and she agreed to speak
               with me upon her return. In the meantime Topaz and I were
               contacted by O'Neal, who agreed to speak with me. Upon speaking
               with O'Neal she explained she had been contacted by Breting
               latee on the night of 02/06/16. She went on to tell me Breting
               had just returned from a fraternity party where she had spoken
               with Hart. During this conversation she explained the
               conversation she had with Hart was regarding his treatment of
               another female named Stephanie and Topaz's problems with it.
               After being asked what to do, O'Neal told Breting she needed to
               speak with Topaz herself to resolve this. Shortly after this
               she told me the conversation ended and she had gone to bed and
               did not see Breting again until later in the day on 02/07/16.
               Around this point Rogers arrived and I concluded my
               conversation with O'Neal before speaking with her where I was
               told the following. Rogers explained she had heard about the
               incident involving Breting on 02/07/16. I asked her what she
               recalled about it and was told Topaz had laughed about the
               comments Breting had made, in addition to not being happy about
               Breting creating drama for him. When she described Breting she
               described her as creating drama, adding this was not the first
               time. She went on and told me her room shares a wall with the
               lounge on the 7th floor and can hear what's being said through
               it. During the conversation between Breting and Topaz she told
               me voices were not raised and at one point she had left her
               room walking by the open lounge. She described Topaz sitting on
               the door side of the table, half turned towards the center of
               the room. Breting was sitting on the other side of the table
               facing the door. Neither party was looking directly at the
               other. When asked about what was going on in the room she told

               me they were talking and after making a few comments she left.
               I asked if she was concerned about the direction of the
               conversation and she told me she was not, adding Breting wanted
               to speak with Topaz alone. I asked her if she had made any
               comments trying to lighten the mood in the room. She did not
               recall specifically making any comments and when asked about
               the comment about not killing Breting I was told she didn't
               recall saying that or anything else specifically. I asked her
               if she heard Topaz making any comments to that effect and was
               told he was laughing about some comments, but she wasn't sure
               about what specifically. I thanked her for her time and we both
               cleared a short time later. Following my leaving the building I
               spoke with Breting, who was in the process of moving items from
               her room. I explained I had spoke with Topaz, as well as
               O'Neal, and Rogers. I went on to tell her I would write this
               information up and forward it to student conduct and they may
               be in contact with her. She asked me about obtaining a copy of
               this report and I explained how she could go about that along
               with providing her with my business card in the event her
               mother wanted to speak with me. She told me that was fine and
               authorized me to speak with her mother before we both cleared.
               Upon returning to the WSU Police Department I later contacted
               Hart, who agreed to speak with me regarding what he knew. Hart
               explained he had spoken with Breting on the night of the the
               7th as had been described. He went on to tell me she had been
               drinking alcohol at his fraternity when the conversation about
               Topaz had taken place. When I asked him what specifically had
               been said, I was told he couldn't really recall. We continued
               to speak about this incident and he told me there were a number
               of people he was speaking to that evening and he didn't
               specifically recall what all had been discussed. I asked him if
               he has spoken with Topaz since that night and was told he has
               not, adding he has not seen him. I thanked him for his time and
               cleared a short time later. At this time Breting simply wants
               this case documented and I recommend it be sent to Student
               Conduct. Nothing further at this time. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               8th day of February, 2016, in Pullman, Washington.
