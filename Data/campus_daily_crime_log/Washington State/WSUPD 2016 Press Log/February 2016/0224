               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0938 SYNOPSIS: Report that a student was
               assaulted by a teacher in his biology 140 class in Todd Hall
               room 116. Student wanted us to be informed at this point and
               didn't want to pursue charges unless the WSU Biology Department
               doesn't want to do anything about the instructor's behavior.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Bethany Marshall
               (Suspect) Pending Assault 2. Andrew Song (051897) Victim
               NARRATIVE: On 022416 at approximately 1205 hours, I was
               dispatched to a report of an Assualt in the lobby of the WSU
               Police Department. Upon arrival, I contacted Andrew Song who
               told me the following. On 022316 at approximately 1155 hours,
               he was assaulted by his professor, Bethany Marshall, of his
               Biology 140 class. He told me earlier in the class he was
               sitting near the middle of the classroom in Todd Hall room 116
               and he was sending an email on his cell phone. He told me
               Marshall called him out for being on his cell phone in class.
               He told me he promptly put his phone away. After class was let
               out, Marshall approached him on the side isle and pointed at
               him as he was exiting his row. She stated to him, "You're never
               going to use your phone in my class again!" As she said this,
               she grabbed him by the collar of his shirt and was face to face
               with him. He told her he needed to send an important email. She
               responded with, "I don't give a shit if you're sending an
               email!" At this point, she continued talking to him, but he
               shut her out. She let go and he left the class. He told me he
               was reporting this assault as a last resort and that he didn't
               want anything done about it at this point. He stated he has
               talked to the Ombudsman's office, the Dean of Student's office,
               and the Director of the Biology Department Larry Hufford
               regarding this instructor, and he wants to wait and see what is
               done by the university about the situation before proceeding
               criminally against Marshall. I asked him when he would know if
               he wanted me to proceed with my investigation, and he told me
               he would be come by the police department Friday 02/26/16 and
               let me know. At approximately 1530 hours, I contacted Larry
               Hufford regarding the complaint Song made to him about
               Marshall. Hufford told me he has had a conversation with
               Marshall regarding the incident and her account is very similar
               to Song's account of the incident. He told me he has contacted
               WSU HRS and the Dean Darryl DeWald with the incident and is
               waiting to hear how to proceed. I explained that Song told me
               he would like to be moved to a different Biology 140 class.
               Hufford told me there is an online version of the Biology 140

               class that has a different instructor and he recommended to
               Song that he be placed in that class so he doesn't have to
               communicate or contact with Marshall anymore. I explained to
               Hufford that Song made a comment regarding filing a lawsuit
               against the university because of the incident and told him
               that I was going to be sending what I had to the WSU Attorney
               General's Office for review. He told me he understood and he
               was going to do everything on his end to make sure university
               policies and procedures are being followed as it pertains to
               the incident in question. Case pending further contact with
               Song regarding his wishes with this case. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               a possible fraud on a school application. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 02/24/16 at
               approximately 1654 hours I was dispatched to a fraud case at
               the WSU Admissions office. I contacted Nancy K. Wehrung
               07/19/64, who stated she came across a situation with an
               application that she wanted me made aware of. Wehrung stated
               that on 01/30/16 Fatima P. Pantoja Arechiga 06/24/92 filled out
               an online WSU student application for admission. On 02/01/16
               another application under Fatima's name was filed. The second
               application had the same name, birthdate, and social security
               number on it. However the address, email, and prior schooling
               information was different. Wehrung stated she was contacted by
               Fatima about the situation and Fatima stated she never
               submitted a second application. Wehrung explained, when a
               student files an online application, the application is handled
               by a third party company, CollegeNET, Inc. Wehrung stated she
               had been in contact with the IT department at CollegeNET who
               looked into the two applications. Wehrung stated that the IT
               department told her that it appeared someone had access to
               Fatima's info and used it to create another application. The IT
               department informed Wehrung that it appeared that Fatima's info
               was most likely obtained from a virus on her computer. Wehrung
               stated that Fatima's account would be corrected to the
               information she originally provided. I called Fatima and asked
               her about the situation. Fatima stated she filled out an online
               application on 01/30/16 and submitted it. On 01/31/16 she
               received an email from accounts@applyweb.com. The email was a
               password reset email asking Fatima to follow the link to reset
               her password. Fatima did not request to reset the password so
               she ignored it believing it was a scam email. Fatima was
               waiting on a WSU network ID so she could access WSU services
               however it did not come in the timeframe that she was
               expecting. Fatima began to email WSU and found that the email
               WSU had on file was not the email she provided. This is were
               the discrepancies were found. Fatima was concerned about this
               causing her application to WSU not to be considered. I
               reassured Fatima that her application had been corrected and it
               should not be an issue. I asked Fatima if she had anti-virus on
               her computer and Fatima said she believed so. I recommended
               Fatima that she take her computer to someone who could add more
               security option to her computer. I also recommenced that Fatima
               changed her passwords to prevent people from accessing her

               account. We talked about Fatima's options about someone
               accessing her personal information. Fatima decided that she
               would contact her local Police Department in California about
               the possible theft of personal information since the crime
               occurred there and not in Washington. Fatima's main concern was
               her application which had been dealt with. It does not appear
               that by her information on her application being changed
               damaged her account or application process. I contacted WSU IT
               about the situation so they could make sure nobody else was
               trying to access her WSU account. I certify and declare under

               lost his wallet at the Student Rec Center (SRC). Kobi stated he
               got to the SRC at approximately 1600 hours and left around 1700
               hours. While leaving the SRC he noticed he was missing his

               Cougar ID card, US Bank debit card, and approximate $30 dollars
               in cash. Kobi had already called US Bank and canceled his card

               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W0944 SYNOPSIS: Responded to a
               parking problem in the green lot on the corner of Thatuna Rd
               and Colorado St. Reporting party was able to move his vehicle
               before I arrived. Nothing further. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 02/24/16 at about 2207 hours I
               responded to a parking problem in the green lot on the corner
               of Thatuna Rd and Colorado St. The reporting party, Nicholas
               Nguyen, stated his vehicle was blocked by other vehicles, and
               he could not get out of his space. I arrived and Nguyen was not
               there. I asked dispatch to call him back. Nguyen told dispatch
               he was able to get his vehicle out, and left the area. There is
               no signs in that area of the parking lot and the ground
               markings are unclear. As I was on scene the driver of one of
               the vehicles, that had blocked Nguyen, came back to her
               vehicle. I talked to, Sena Burchak, about making sure in the
               future that she did not block other vehicles. I did not contact
               the driver of the other vehicle that had blocked Nguyen's
               vehicle. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 24th day of February,
               2016, in Pullman, Washington.
