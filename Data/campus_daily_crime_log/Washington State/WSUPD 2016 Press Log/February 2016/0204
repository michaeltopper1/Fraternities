               NARRATIVE: On 020416 I was dispatched to a disabled vehicle at
               the intersection of Stadium Way and North Fairway. I responded
               to the area and found the R/P's vehicle sitting on North
               Fairway westbound. I contacted the R/P a Alyssa Overton. She
               stated that he car just died and now its in park and cannot
               move it. I had Officer Westerman get the jump pack thinking it
               would get enough voltage to release the shifter. Westerman
               showed me the Tow switch on the console that allows you to
               manually released the safety switch. We moved the vehicle into
               a parking spot. When I was looking at the battery I noticed the
               positive pole was loose. We tighten the pole and used the jump
               pack to start the vehicle. I told Overton to let the vehicle
               run a while then see if tightening the pole fixed the problem.
               She said she would, thanked Westerman and I and we cleared. I
               did not run the plate of the vehicle....... Nothing further....

               of marijuana. Room contacted but no one was in the subsequent
               suite in question. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 020416 at approximately 2150 hours I was
               dispatched to the report of the odor of marijuana coming from
               room 271 in Global Scholars Hall. I met with RED Martin who
               took me to the room. I could smell the odor from the door and
               nowhere else. I knocked on the door and eventually Austin C.
               Marler (042397) answered the door. He confirmed he was under 21
               and did not have a medicinal marijuana card. The odor of
               marijuana increased when he opened the door. After asking about
               marijuana Marler said he did not know why I was there. Inside
               there were 2 suites, 271 A and 271 B. Marler lives in 271 A. He
               stated Jacob Bauman (102996) of 271 B was the one who was
               partaking in marijuana. The smell did seem to be stronger from
               that direction. However, Marler had slightly red eyes, acted
               very nervous, and had milky film on his tongue. He allowed me
               into his room and the odor of marijuana decreased. I performed
               the Romberg test with Marler and his eyes twitched incessantly.
               Along with Hall staff, I educated Marler on what to do in the
               future regarding the odor and room 271 B. We cleared. No action
               taken. Nothing follows. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 5th day of February,

               was there because someone reported the odor of marijuana coming
               from his room. Walls does not have a roommate at this time. I
               asked if there was any marijuana in the room, Walls said there
               was not. He said he had smoked marijuana earlier off campus, at
               a friends house. Walls said he did not smoke on campus and did
               not have any marijuana in his room. I asked him how old he was,
               he said he was 19. I asked him if he had a medical marijuana
               card, he said he had one but it expired on his 19th birthday. I
               explained to Walls I was warning him for possession of
               marijuana and I would be forwarding my report to student
               conduct. I again Walls if there was any marijuana in his room,
               he said there was not. I asked if he had any questions. He said
               he did not and I cleared the call. Sent to student conduct.
               Warned. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of
