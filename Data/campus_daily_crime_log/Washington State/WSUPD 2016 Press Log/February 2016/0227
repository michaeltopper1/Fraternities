               2. NARRATIVE: On 02/27/16 at approximately 0730 hours I met
               with Robert Baca (WSU Army ROTC Cadre) at the WSUPD. Baca
               explained that ROTC in Moscow has had three separate incidents
               involving the same two suspicious males in the last three days.
               Baca said that several university ROTC programs were coming to
               WSU to do a joint classroom training today. Baca asked if WSUPD
               could do extra patrols of the parking lots that the ROTC
               vehicles were to be parked in. I told Baca to have the ROTC
               vehicles park in the WSUPD lot and that I would still do extra
               patrols of the area and walk through Todd Hall periodically.
               LTC Heatherly had provided me with the plate and description of
               the vehicle associated with the suspicious calls in Moscow.
               During the extra patrols I did not see any suspicious subjects
               or the vehicle. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 27th day of February, 2016, in

               02/27/16 at approximately 1300 hours I was traveling on Bishop
               Blvd and ran the plate of the vehicle (WA C75737D) in front of

               D. Jones. I ran William's OLN (as I could see a 40-50 year old
               male was driving the vehicle) and his driver's status returned
               DWLS 3rd. The vehicle turned into the parking lot for MJ's and
               I activated my emergency lights. I contacted the driver and
               told him the stop was being recorded. The driver asked why I
               stopped him and I explained that one of the registered owners
               was suspended and asked what his name was and he said William
               Jones. William said he thought the suspension didn't start
               until March. Jones provided me with his license and
               registration. I returned to my vehicle and confirmed the
               information matched up. I went back and told Jones I was going
               to issue him a citation. I completed a SECTOR citation for

               right to counsel, and reminded him that the stop was being
               recorded. I provided Jones with a copy of the ticket and told

               statements. Subject contacted and provided with resources.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Ariel J. Flicker
               03/30/95 2. NARRATIVE: On 02/27/16 at approximately 1355 hours
               I was dispatched to a welfare check for a subject at McEachern
               Hall. The call was received by NYPD and forwarded to Whitcom.
               The reporting party, Rebecca Minsley, said that Ariel Flicker
               had messaged her saying that she wanted to kill herself and was
               walking to a bridge. Ofc. Olmstead and I responded to McEachern
               Hall room 420 and contacted Flicker. Flicker answered the door
               wearing a towel and Ofc. Olmstead asked if she had time to talk
               and asked her to put on clothes. Flicker said she had no
               obligation to talk to us and began to close the door. Ofc.
               Olmstead stopped the door from closing and explained that we
               were there for a welfare check and wanted to make sure
               everything was ok. Flicker explained that she was mad when she
               made the comment to her friend, but was not planning on hurting
               or killing herself. Flicker said she planned on just staying in
               her room. We explained that we could get Flicker help and she
               said she could handle it on her own and has her own therapist
               in New York that she talks with 3 times a week. I provided
               Flicker with my business card with Counseling Services phone
               number. Flicker threw it across her room. Flicker made it clear
               that she did not like or trust the police and I told her to
               contact us if we can be of further assistance. Flicker closed
               the door and we left. I called Minsley and asked her what
               happened. Minsley said that she was thinking about Flicker so
               she messaged her and asked how she was doing. Minsley said
               Flicker responded that she wanted to die and was walking to a
               bridge. Minsley said that Flicker has made suicidal threats in
               the past, but never made any attempts. Minsley said that
               Flicker messaged her after we talked with her and said that she
               was blocking her number. I told Minsley to contact us if she
               learns of anything else we can help out with. I contacted the
               on duty RED, Tiffany Firestone, and notified her of the
               situation. I told her that hall staff might have better luck
               talking with Flicker. Firestone said she would have the RA
               follow up with her. I sent an email to WSU Counseling Services
               to notify them of the encounter. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 27th day of

               he knew why I was there, and he said no. I told Velasquez I got
               called because the odor of marijuana was coming from the room.
               He told me he does not live here, and that his friend that does
               is currently taking a shower. I asked Velasquez if he smoked in
               the room, and he said no. I asked him if his friend had been
               smoking in the room, and he replied not that he knew of. The
               resident of the room who was in the shower was later identified
               as Drew K. Branley (DOB 05-02-97). I asked Velasquez either him
               or Branley are over the age of 21, and he said no. I asked if
               either of them have a medical marijuana card, and he said they
               do not. I asked Velasquez to go see if Branley could hurry up
               in the shower so he could speak with me. Velasquez returned and
               said Branley would be out soon. Velasquez went back inside of
               room #438 and shut the door. I waited a few more minutes, and
               the water was still running in the shower. I again knocked on
               the door and Velasquez answered. I told Velasquez if Branley
               had marijuana in the room that he needed to tell him to get rid
               of it. I cleared the scene. No further action. My Vievu camera
               was activated, and the video was later downloaded into the
               permanent digital evidence folder. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 28th day of
               February, 2016, in Pullman, Washington.

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Boyd/335 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W1009 SYNOPSIS: Subject called 911
               initially complaining about under age drinking. He later stated
               he was being harassed by a female. It was determined he had a
               disagreement with his girlfriend and no crime occurred. The
               complainant was warned for MIP exhibiting. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Neil E. Druliner/022596 Warned MIP
               Exhibiting 2. NARRATIVE: On 02/27/16 at about 2259 hrs Dispatch
               advised of a 911 call where the complainant, later identified
               as Niel E. Druliner (022596), called to report under age
               drinking at Community Duncan Dunn Hall. Dispatch advised he
               sounded very intoxicated and refused to provide any details
               before hanging up. A short time later he called back and stated
               he was being harassed by a female. He was supposed to be
               standing outside Community Duncan Dunn Hall. Sergeant Griffin
               and I searched the area but could not locate Druliner. I
               contacted Druliner several times on the phone and each time he
               would start to talk to me then hang up. It was clear based on
               his slurred speech he was intoxicated. Over the course of
               several phone calls I was able to gather that Druliner had an
               argument with his girlfriend. He told me everything was taken
               care of. I told him I needed to speak with him and asked him to
               come outside. After several more phone calls I was able to get
               Druliner outside to speak with him in person. Druliner appeared
               to be under 21 and was quite intoxicated. He spoke with slurred
               speech and stumbled as he walked. He told me he and his
               girlfriend, Hannah L. Still (041996), had an argument because
               he was texting another girl. According to Druliner they broke
               up during the argument. He was in Community Duncan Dunn trying
               to find Still's room so he could get his phone charger back. I
               contacted Still on the phone and she told me she was not at her
               dorm. She told me she and Druliner had an argument and that she
               told him he could not stay with her and she did not want to
               talk to him because he was too intoxicated and she couldn't
               deal with him when he was that drunk. She said at no point in
               time was the argument physical in nature. She said Druliner was
               supposed to be staying with another friend. I warned Druliner
               for criminal trespass because he had been in the dorm
               unescorted. I also warned him for MIP exhibiting and told him
               Still did not want to speak with him while he was intoxicated.
               Druliner was instructed to go to his friend's house and was
               released. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 28 day of February,

               frat party. Both subjects were transported to PRH. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 02-27-16 I was
               contacted by Officer Emerson from Pullman PD concerning a
               possible Ruffie incident that occurred in an off campus
               fraternity. He stated that two females, Rachel May Burkhart III
               DOD/080297and Nicole Lynn Breting DOB/08-17-96 were ruffied at
               a party. The two left the party and were currently in
               Goldworthy 116. He stated he spoke to the two females. One of
               the females was unconscious and the other was having problems
               staying awake. I told Emerson I would meet him there and
               notified dispatch to send medic to the Goldsworth location.
               Upon our arrival to room 116 we met Rachael and Nicole. Rachael
               was semi responsive and Nicole was speaking, but her speech was
               slurred and her physical movements were extremely slow. Rachel
               started coming around more as time when on. While Emerson spoke
               to the two we learned that the two were at Phi Beta Theta
               Fraternity. They were there for a party. The two got what they
               thought was wine from the "Women's Only" spot. It was about 5
               minutes when Rachael started feeling funny. Shortly after
               Nicole started feeling the same way. The two called a friend
               for a ride. They were picked up and taken to Goldsworthy Hall.
               Pullman Fire arrived on scene. The determined Rachael need to
               be transported to PRH via ambulance, but Nicole could go POV.
               Emerson took Nicole to PRH in his patrol vehicle. Hall staff
               was notified of the situation...... I certify and declare under

               bike stolen from outside of Streit Hall. No suspects or leads
               and no serial number. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               2. NARRATIVE: On 022716 at approximately 2313 hours I was
               flagged down at NE Wilson Rd and Stadium Way by Charles S. Root
               (091196). He told me his bike had been stolen. He informed me
               it had been locked up outside Streit Hall and he found it gone
               at approximately 2245 hours. He had last seen it at
               approximately 1600 hours on 022516. Root had no suspects or
               leads. He paid $220 for the Specialized P1 Dirt Jumping bike.
               It resembles a mountain bike in basic appearance. He did not
               have the serial number. There is a front shock and there is a
               disc brake only on the rear tire. There is not a brake on the
               front of the bike. It has 26" tires. Unique to the bike is
               removed paint on the horizontal tube near the handle bars from
               where Root kept his lock. He said it should look silver where
               it rubbed. The bike was originally a multi-speed bike but the
               rear sprockets had been removed to make the bike a single
               speed. So there should be extra and obvious space where they
               were originally. There are also aftermarket handle bars. He did
               not know the make of them. Root showed me where the bike had
               been taken. The bike rack is located just south of Streit Hall
               near the eastern entrance off of Cougar Way. The lock appeared
               to have been cut with large bolt cutters. I provided Root with
               his case number and my contact information. I recommend he
               attempt to locate the serial number and also check Craiglist
               for his bike. I cleared. When I returned to the station I had
               an email from Root regarding a suspicious posting on
               Craigslist-https://pullman.craigslist.org/bik/5467386463.html.
               It advertised 2 bikes with no pictures. One bike was priced $25
               and the other for $75 or both for $90. Lists 26" tires. I told
               him we would look into it. I also requested he send pictures of
               his bike, which he sent, and I uploaded to the case. I knew
               Ofc. Stewart had recently had some stolen bike cases. As I was
               going on my weekend, Sgt. Griffin let me ask dayshift to look
               into the Craigslist ad. Case pending. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               Thepvongsa/101096 Fwd Chgs. MIP Exhibiting 2. NARRATIVE: On
               02/28/16 at about 0016 hrs I heard a Pullman PD officer advise
               there were two females trying to carry a third female down the
               sidewalk near the corner of Linden and Thatuna. I responded and
               noticed two females, who were not identified, trying to assist
               a third, later identified as Mikaela C. Thepvongsa (101096) in
               walking down the sidewalk. Thepvongsa appeared to be under 21
               and was having extreme difficulty walking. She was stumbling
               side to side even as she walked with one arm around each of her
               friends. I stopped and contacted Thepvongsa near the entrance
               to the old booking garage from Cougar Way. I asked how much she
               had to drink and she said, "I'm good". I said she wasn't good
               and she explained shes deaf and she had difficulty hearing me.
               Her friends explained she lost her hearing aids. They tried to
               say that was what was causing her balance issues. I could see
               Thepvongsa was swaying as she stood and know that hearing aids
               do not assist with a persons balance. I told her friends
               Thepvongsa was drunk too and they said "I know". I asked if she
               had any ID and she said she did not. They provided me with her
               name and date of birth, which confirmed she was under 21. As I
               spoke to Thepvongsa I could smell the odor of intoxicants on
               her breath. She swayed side to side as she stood talking to me.
               I asked if I could check her eyes and she agreed. I attempted
               to administer a horizontal gaze nystagmus test but she would
               not hold her head still. I advised Thepvongsa I would be
               forwarding charges to the Whitman County Prosecutor's Office
               for MIP exhibiting. She was released to her sober friends, who
               were not identified. Nothing further. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W1014 SYNOPSIS: Subject was contacted for
               MIP exhibiting. Charges forwarded to the whitman county
               proscutor's office and student conduct. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Lucile Linda Beckett Fwd Chgs MIP Exhibiting 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 02/28/16 at about 0058 hrs I was driving
               eastbound on Cougar Way when I noticed two females who were
               walking eastbound next to the lower soccer field. They caught
               my attention because one of them, later identified as Lucile L.
               Beckett (041997), was having a lot of difficulty walking. She
               was holding on to her friend for balance and still stumbling
               side to side as she walked. It was very clear Beckett was
               intoxicated by alcohol. As I drove past I could see Beckett
               appeared to be under 21. I contacted Beckett between the lower
               soccer field and Global Scholars Hall. I asked how Beckett was
               doing and her friend said "shes been better". I said Beckett
               was pretty drunk and Beckett responded, "Yes I am" and then
               mumbled some things I could not understand before saying she
               was going to bed. Beckett's speech was very slurred and I could
               smell a strong odor of intoxicants on her breath. I asked if
               she had her driver's license with her and she said she did not
               but provided me with her cougar card and date of birth, which
               confirmed she was under 21. I asked if I could check Beckett's
               eyes and she agreed. I was unable to administer a horizontal
               gaze nystagmus test because she started to move her head during
               the test and I could see she was not going to be able to follow
               the instructions. Beckett swayed in a circular motion while she
               stood and stumbled to the side several times while standing
               still during our conversation. I told Beckett I was going to be
               forwarding charges to the prosecutor's office for MIP
               Exhibiting and she said, "You're gonna feel intoxicated but
               that's fine". Beckett's friend, who was not identified, said
               she would make sure she got home ok and her roommate was with
               her. Beckett was released. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               28 day of February, 2016, in Pullman, Washington.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W1015 SYNOPSIS: report of a subject was
               was intoxicated in her room at Regents. It was determined she
               did not need medical attention and a sober friend agreed to
               stay with her. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 02/28/16 at about 0106 hrs Dispatch toned out
               Pullman Fire for an intoxicated person at Regents Hall room
               401. I responded and found hall staff with Lucile L. Beckett
               (041997), in her room. I recognized Beckett from having just
               contacted her outside regarding an MIP Case (see related case).
               Hall staff said her friend brought her home and then left. They
               did not know if her roommate was around, they found Beckett
               because she was laying in the room with the door open. I spoke
               to Beckett and determined she was still able to carry on a
               conversation. She was highly intoxicated but did not need
               medical attention at that time. One of Beckett's friends,
               Amanda J. Fairbanks (051697), who was sober noticed we were in
               the room and stopped to check on Beckett. Fairbanks agreed to
               stay with Beckett through the night to keep an eye on her. I
               had the ambulance cancel as Beckett did not need any medical
               attention. I told Fairbanks if Beckett lost consciousness or
               became unresponsive. Nothing further. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Jordan Thomas/032994 Arrested/Booked DWLS 1st
               degree 2. NARRATIVE: On 02/28/16 at about 0156 hrs I was
               stopped along Stadium Way near Vogel Hall when I noticed a
               vehicle that was traveling north bound on Stadium Way at a
               speed that appeared to be faster than the posted 20 MPH speed
               limit. I activated my police traffic radar unit, vehicle 38,
               which emitted a high pitched audio doppler tone that was
               increasing in pitch. I observed a display on the radar unit
               that started at 27 MPH and increased to 30 MPH as the vehicle
               reached North Fairway Rd. At the time of the readings the
               vehicle was the only moving vehicle in the radar field. The
               calibration of the radar unit was checked both before and after
               the stop by the use of factory certified tuning forks. The
               radar unit was found to be in proper working order. I caught up
               to the vehicle and initiated a traffic stop on the vehicle,
               turning on my overhead lights. The vehicle stopped on Stadium
               Way near Creston Ln. I contacted the driver, Jordan Thomas
               (032994), and told him the reason for the stop and the stop was
               being recorded. I asked for his driver's license, vehicle
               registration, and proof of insurance. He provided me with a WA
               ID card and said he did not have a driver's license. He also
               told me the vehicle was a rental car. As I was speaking with
               Thomas I could smell the odor of marijuana emitting from the
               vehicle. I had him step out of the vehicle and asked if he
               smoked. He said no and agreed to perform field sobriety tests.
               I determined he was not impaired. I checked Thomas' driver's
               license through Dispatch, who advised his driving status was
               DWLS 1st degree. I placed Thomas under arrest for DWLS 1st
               degree and he was transported to the Pullman PD holding
               facility and later to the Whitman County Jail for booking.
               Officer Tiengo remained on scene with the vehicle and passenger
               until Thomas' sister, Jasmine L. Cheatham (031393), arrived to
               take possession of the vehicle. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W1018 SYNOPSIS: Subject reported the odor
               of marijuana coming from a room in Streit Hall. Officer
               responded and subject was under the age of 21 and had been
               smoking marijuana in his room earlier. The marijuana was

               NARRATIVE: On 02-28-16 at approximately 0214 hours I was
               dispatched to the report of the odor of marijuana coming from
               room #234 in Streit Hall, located at 1620 NE Cougar Way. I
               arrived on scene. The hall director, Richard A. Wallace (DOB
               07-03-90), told me I probably would no longer be able to smell
               the marijuana because the strong odor of febreze is now coming
               from the room. I went to room #234 and I could not smell the
               odor of marijuana through the crack in the door. I knocked on
               the door and a male later identified as Alexander S.
               Zeutenhorst (DOB 05-24-97) answered the door. I told him I was
               recording. I asked him if he knew why I was there, and he
               replied "okay", and then said "no, no I don't". I told
               Zeutenhorst I received a call because his room smells like
               marijuana. I asked him who was smoking marijuana in the room,
               and he did not respond. I told Zeutenhorst as long as he was
               cooperative with me there would be no criminal charges because
               this is the first time we have been called to his room. I told
               him that he needed to collect the marijuana and we would go
               destroy it. Zeutenhorst told me he only had a small amount of
               marijuana in the room. I asked Zeutenhorst if he was 21 years
               old, and he said no. I asked him if he had a medical marijuana
               card, and he said no. I told Zeutenhorst to gather up any
               marijuana, drug paraphernalia, alcohol, or any other illegal
               drugs in his room. Zeutenhorst brought me over two small ziploc
               baggies containing marijuana. I asked him what he had been
               using to smoke out of, and he brought me over his vape. I had
               him empty the marijuana that was inside of his vape.
               Zeutenhorst told me had been smoking marijuana inside of his
               dorm room about an hour ago or thirty minutes ago. He told me
               he was the only one inside of the room when he was smoking
               marijuana. Zeutenhorst followed me outside to a nearby dumpster
               where he disposed of his marijuana. I told him he would be
               referred to WSU Student Conduct, and he said he understood.
               Zeutenhorst was polite and cooperative throughout my encounter
               with him. No further action. My Vievu camera was activated, and
               the video was later downloaded into the permanent digital

               on a window sill at Perham Hall. The resident of the room was

               possession of marijuana and alcohol. Student conduct only.

               about 0212 hrs I was in the process of dealing with a suspended
               driver on Stadium Way near Perham Hall when Officer Tiengo who
               was with me advised there was a male hanging out of a window at
               Perham Hall. I turned and could see a male standing on the
               window sill of a 2nd floor room. He was leaning out and looking
               up to the floor above, where there were several people who had
               been yelling and making noise at us while I dealt with the
               traffic offense. A short time later the male went back in the
               room. I told Officer Tiengo to count the windows over to the
               one in question and we would go talk to them later. After
               clearing the DWLS Officer Tiengo and I went to the 2nd floor of
               Perham. Officer Tiengo said the window had been the 9th one
               from the west end of the building. We determined that window
               corresponded to room 224. I knocked on the door at room 224 and
               a male, later identified as Aidan M. Amant (112196), answered
               the door. As soon as the door opened I could smell the odor of
               burnt marijuana coming from the room and also noticed a box of
               Keystone beer with several unopened cans in it laying on the
               floor. I told Amant we were there regarding the person seen
               hanging out the window earlier. He admitted his friend had been
               leaning out the window to see who was yelling on the floor
               above them. I told Amant even if it was his friend leaning out
               the window he was responsible for the activities taking place
               in his room. I told Amant I could smell the odor of marijuana
               coming from his room and noticed the towel at the bottom of the
               door, which is a way people commonly try to block the odor of
               marijuana from escaping the room. I noticed his eyes were very
               red and told him I could tell he had been smoking in the room.
               I also advised him I saw the beer laying on the floor in his
               room. I told Amant to gather all of the illegal items in the
               room and his Driver's license. I told him I would be sending
               the incident to student conduct. Amant brought out a small bag
               containing a glass pipe with marijuana residue on it and a
               small plastic bag with marijuana in it. He also brought out the
               box with approximately 8 full cans inside. I escorted him down
               to the dumpster where the items were destroyed. Incident sent

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: DBT/321 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W1020 SYNOPSIS: Fire alarm at Bryan Hall.
               Law enforcement and Pullman Fire arrived on scene. There was no
               fire emergency. Fire extinguisher had been maliciously
               discharged on the fourth floor. No suspects or leads at this
               time. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               02-28-16 at approximately 0431 hours Pullman Fire was toned out
               to a fire alarm at Bryan Hall, located at 605 NE Library Mall.
               I arrived on scene. I could see the alarms flashing inside of
               Bryan Hall, and I could hear the audible alarm sounding. I
               walked around the entire building, but did not see any smoke or
               flames showing from outside of the building. I did not see
               anyone in the area or any doors propped open. Pullman Fire soon
               arrived on scene. Pullman Fire advised there was smoke on the
               fourth floor of Bryan Halll, but they were unsure what the
               source of the smoke was. They later determined someone had
               maliciously discharged the fire extinguisher that was located
               near the wall by room #407. They told me the alarm was set off
               because the particles from the fire extinguisher foam were in
               the air on the fourth floor. Once Pullman Fire finished
               clearing the building I went inside to see the damage. Most of
               the floor tile on the fourth floor had been covered in fire
               extinguisher foam. The blue seal was broken, and it was laying
               on the ground near the fire extinguisher box. The pin from the
               fire extinguisher handle was also laying on the ground. The
               door to the fire extinguisher case was also open. The fire
               extinguisher was still inside of the case, but it was covered
               in foam from being discharged. I estimated the damage to the
               fire extinguisher to be about $200.00. I estimated the damage
               to the floor tile to be about $20.00. I took photographs of the
               fire extinguisher and the damage. The photos have been uploaded
               into Spillman. The WSU Facilities employee began to clean up
               the floor. He also told me that he would take the fire
               extinguisher to get it recharged. I walked around Bryan Hall to
               see if the individual who set off the fire extinguisher was
               still in the building, but I was unable to locate anyone. I
               cleared the scene. No suspects or leads at this time. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.
               Dated this 29th day of February, 2016, in Pullman, Washington.
