    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: JAK/333 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W1113 SYNOPSIS: A former WSU student said
               a WSU student approached the table he was sitting at in Holland
               Library. The WSU student has a no-contact order against the
               former WSU student. The former WSU student feels he is being
               harassed. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 03-03-16, Faisal F.A.A. Alqudairi (01-10-90) came to the WSU
               Police Department and requested to speak with an Officer. I met
               Alqudairi in the WSU Police Department Lobby and escorted him
               to the interview room so we could talk. I asked Alqudairi what
               I could do for him and he explained he wanted to talk to me
               about an incident involving Lujain A.M. Alaali (01-08-94).
               Alaali has an active Order for Protection against Alqudairi
               which expires on 09-10-17. Alqudairi knows he is not to be
               anywhere Alaali is and if he sees her, he is supposed to leave
               the area. He says he has been trying to do so, but feels like
               Alaali has lied and made false claims against him. Alqudairi
               said on 03-03-16, at approximately 1200 hours, he was studying
               in Holland Library. He said he was concentrating on his
               computer, not paying much attention to what was going on around
               him. He said he looked up for a moment and to his right. He
               said he was shocked at who he saw and jumped back in his chair.
               He said Alaali had sat down at the same table he was studying
               at. When he realized it was her, he gathered his belongings and
               left the area. He said he was in such a hurry to leave that he
               actually left a few things on the table. He went to the main
               Library lobby and waited for approximately 10 to 12 minutes. He
               went back to the area he had been studying to see if Alaali had
               left; because he had to get the other items he left on the
               table, and she was gone. He said he gathered the rest of his
               belongings and came to the Police Department to report what
               happened. Alqudairi said he feels like Alaali sat by him on
               purpose with the intent to harass and get him in trouble. I
               advised Alqudairi he should consider trying to obtain his own
               Order for Protection from Alaali as an option to keep this type
               of behavior from happening. He said he would speak with his
               attorney about it and feels this Police Report would help his
               cause. I gave Alqudairi a business card with his Police case
               number on it and advised him to report any similar incidents in
               the future. At approximately 1428 hours, I called the phone
               number for Alaali (509-319-8111) to see if I could speak with
               her regarding Alqudairi. I received her voice mail so I left
               her a message asking her to call me. At approximately 1455
               hours, Alaali called me. I informed her Alqudairi had been

               trespassed from the WSU Student Recreation Center so she would
               not have to worry about seeing Alqudairi there. I then asked
               her how things have been going for her lately and asked if she
               had seen Alqudairi recently. She said she had actually seen him
               earlier today (03-03-16). She said she had gone to Holland
               Library to study. She said she left her study materials on a
               table in the Library and went to get coffee. She said when she
               returned to the table her items were on, she saw Alqudairi was
               sitting at the table. She said as soon as he saw her, he
               gathered his belongings and left. She said she did not feel as
               if Alqudairi knew the items on the table belonged to her and
               was comfortable with his actions when he saw her. It appears as
               if Alqudairi did not violate the Order for Protection as he
               left the area as soon as he saw Alaali. Nothing further at this
               time. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the
               laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 3rd day of March, 2016, in Pullman,

               approximately 1515 hours I was stopped at a red light on NE
               Cougar Way and Stadium Way facing east. I noticed the vehicle
               in front of mine did not have a functioning brake light on the
               driver's side. I activated my emergency lights, stopping the
               vehicle on NE Stadium Way and Flag Ln. I contacted the driver
               and told her the reason for the stop and that the stop was
               being recorded. I asked for the driver's license and was
               provided with a military dependant's ID, identifying her as
               Tracey B. Broadnax 09/11/95. I returned to my patrol car and
               ran the driver and she returned DWLS 3rd. I completed a
               criminal citation for DWLS. I returned to Braodnax's car and
               told her that her license was suspended. I explained the
               citation to her and asked if there was a licensed driver in the
               car. The back passenger said she was and provided me with her
               WADL, identifying her as Rayanna J. Paris 04/12/95. While
               standing at the car I could smell the odor of fresh marijuana
               emitting from the interior. After a short conversation,
               Broadnax admitted that having marijuana in her purse, which she
               provided me. There was a grinder and a glass jar with a small
               amount of marijuana. Broadnax allowed me to search her vehicle,
               finding no further marijuana. I told Broadnax she was free to
               go and that I was just warning her for the marijuana. I
               provided Broadnax with a copy of the citation. I certify and

               I was dispatched to a possible suicide attempt at Stephenson
               East #1101. Officer Welter and I responded. While responding we
               found out that a Samual St John had texted a friend in Hawaii
               telling her "I can't even kill myself, it's impossible to slit
               my wrists with scissors." Upon out arrival at thew door. I
               knocked and St John answered the door. I told him why we were
               there and asked him if he thought he should go to the hospital.
               He said he didn't think so. I asked to see his wrists. He
               pulled up his shirt sleeves and I could clearly see 15 to 20
               superficial slashes on each arm. I told him he was in
               protective custody and we were going to take him to the
               hospital. He got a coat and shoes out of his room. While in
               route to PRH I asked him if he ever attempted to take his life
               before and he said he hadn't. I asked why he would want to end
               his life and he said he was really depressed about failing in
               school and just wanted to end it all. Upon our arrival at the
               hospital I told the staff what was going on, filled out the
               protective custody paperwork then cleared. Officer Petlovany
               called the R/P and informed them that St John was contacted and
               currently being cared for. Nothing further.......... I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the

               for alcohol and subsequently drugs. One subject with a PBT of
               .229 had numerous drug and medical complications. Medics
               responded and felt she was okay to stay in her room with her

               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 030316 at approximately 2345 I
               was dispatched to the report of RA's confronting residents
               regarding alcohol and then marijuana. I responded with Ofc.
               Whitman and met with RA Gray who said Taylor M. Wood (120996)
               had been contacted for being significant intoxication. Wood
               then told her that she also had marijuana. That is when they
               called us. We went to the room and another unidentified male RA
               answered the door. There were several other people in the room
               of varying intoxication levels. Wood allowed me in. Wood had
               slurred speech, watery eyes, illogical speaking
               patterns/responses, and was unable to walk straight. I could
               smell the strong odor of intoxicants on her breath. I had her
               round up everything she was not supposed to have. She produced
               some marijuana and a grinder. She mentioned a bong. I had her
               start placing everything in the hallway as we had limited
               space. The male RA asked if we could keep everything in the
               room and I told him no. Wood provided a breath sample of .229
               on my PBT. We were then toned out to a fight in progress. Sgt.
               Griffin requested we assist him. We left and returned shortly
               after. As we excited the elevator on the 3rd floor we observed
               Holli J. Chose (11/0896) vomiting on the floor directly in
               front of us. We said hello. I recognized her from being in
               Wood's room earlier. I could smell the odor of intoxicants and
               vomit on her breath. She slurred her words when she spoke. She
               admitted to drinking. Her unidentified boyfriend had arrived to
               take her home. He appeared more sober than she. We continued on
               to the room. When we arrived the remaining friends said Wood
               had become unresponsive and was vomiting in her sleep. They
               said she had signifcant medical conditions involving cancer,
               lymph node removal, kidney complications, and congenital spine
               issues. There was a wheelchair in the room. We were also
               directed to a container that housed approximately 8 different
               prescriptions that Wood was on. She had also consumed
               marijuana. I had medics respond to assess her. They arrived
               just after Patrick E. Patel (090396), Woods boyfriend, showed
               up. He appeared to be sober. Medics assessed Wood and were
               comfortable with Patel watching Wood. Hall staff confirmed that
               the contraband had been disposed of. They were provided with
