    Narrative: RVWD: Boyd/335 OFC: DBT/321 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W1329 SYNOPSIS: I was dispatched to an
               agency assist for the Whitman County Sheriff's Office for a
               disabled vehicle on Pullman Airport Rd. Officer arrived on
               scene and waited with vehicle until it was towed away. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 03-13-16 at
               approximately 2350 hours Dispatch advised the Whitman County
               Sheriff's Office was requesting an agency assist for a disabled
               vehicle. Dispatch said the complainant advised there was a
               white in color vehicle stopped in the middle of the road with
               it's hazards on. The caller described the location as being a
               couple miles in on Pullman Airport Rd. from highway 270 coming
               from Moscow. I turned left onto Pullman Airport Rd. from
               highway 270. I located a white, 1995 Mazda 626 (WA Lic.
               ALP8215) a couple miles down on Pullman Airport Rd. parked in
               the northbound lane with it's hazard lights on. There was also
               a truck in front of the Mazda with their hazard lights on. I
               pulled behind the Mazda and activated my emergency lights to
               help warn other drivers of the vehicle in the roadway. The
               driver of the Mazda was later identified as Abigael M. Tkach
               (DOB 07-27-96). Tkach told me she thinks one of the belts under
               the hood was broken. Tkach's friend was attempting to hook her
               Mazda onto his truck using towing straps. Although, there was
               no place to hook the tow straps. I asked Tkach if she wanted me
               to call her a tow truck, and she said yes. I asked her if she
               wanted me to have Dispatch call a certain tow company, and she
               said she did not have a preference. I radioed Dispatch and
               asked them to send a tow truck to our location. Myers Towing
               soon arrived on scene, and the vehicle was removed from the
               roadway. I cleared the scene. No further action. My Vievu
               camera was activated, and the video was later downloaded into
               the permanent digital evidence folder. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               14th day of March, 2016, in Pullman, Washington.
