               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W1213 SYNOPSIS: I received an email from
               district court that sultan S. H. Al Mamari had a warrant for
               his arrest. He was contacted and arrested on the warrant. He

               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Sultan S. H. Al Mamari (11/08/96) Arrested on
               Trespassing warrant. 2. NARRATIVE: On 030816 at approximately
               0900 hours, I checked spillman and noticed that Sultan S. H. Al
               Mamari had a warrant for his arrest. I checked Sultan's address
               and noticed he lives in Orton Hall. I responded to Orton Hall
               and contacted Sultan in his room. I asked him for ID and he
               provided it. I explained to him I was there because I learned
               he had a warrant for his arrest. I asked dispatch to confirm
               the warrant which they did. I placed Sultan under arrest for
               his warrant. I explained to him the warrant was for trespassing
               and read him his constitutional rights. I informed him I was
               recording the arrest. WSUPD Intern Pacer Said handcuffed Sultan
               (DL) and searched his pockets incident to arrest. I transported
               Sultan to Whitman County Jail where I read him the warrant.
               Sultan told me he was an international student from Oman. I
               checked the Consular notification card and Oman was not a
               required notification country. I advised the jail that he was
               from Oman and I had not notified the consulate. The jail staff
               told me they would look into the consular notification and
               confirm that Oman was not on the list. I cleared. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W1216 03/08/16 SYNOPSIS: WSU Cashier's
               office received a counterfeit $20.00 bill in a deposit.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On March
               8, 2016 at about 1045 hours I performed an escort for WSU
               Cashier's office. During this time I learned that the Cashier's
               Office had concerns regarding a $20.00 bill that was received
               in a deposit. The bill was taken to US Bank CUB Branch by WSU
               Cashier's personnel. US Bank personnel confirmed the bill was
               counterfeit. The bill was then turned over to me. The bill was
               received by the Cashier's office on Monday, March 7, 2016. The
               bill was included in a deposit from Ferdinand's. Jessica J.
               Hoffman (05/08/87), Program Assistant, WSU Cashier's discovered
               the bill while processing the deposit. I learned from
               Ferdinand's staff that the deposit in which the bill was found
               was from monies that were made on Friday, March 4, 2016 at
               Ferdinand's. This $20.00 bill was taken in through purchases at
               one of the two cash registers at the business. There are no
               cameras in the business. Ferdinand's has no way to trace or
               track how they received the bill other than through a
               transaction on March 4, 2016. I took the bill to the Washington
               State Employee's Credit Union for a second verification on the
               bill being a counterfeit. WSECU personnel used a black light
               instrument designed to detect counterfeit bills. The instrument
               and personnel both verified that the bill was counterfeit. Some
               of the characteristics that make the bill counterfeit are: The
               bill is shorter in length than a valid $20.00 bill. It is not
               cut evenly. The ink is incorrect. The bill does not have the
               security thread. It does not feel like US bills. The serial
               number on the bill is: MB25824590D It is unknown if the bill
               was passed at Ferdinand's in an attempt to defraud the business
               or if someone received this bill in circulation and used it not
               knowing it was counterfeit. I advised the US Secret Service of
               the counterfeit billat about 1415 hours on this date. The US
               Secret Service asked that the bill be sent to their field
               office in Spokane at the following address: US Secret Service
               528 E. Spokane Falls Blvd Suite 600 Spokane, WA 99202 The bill
               has been scanned, photographed, and placed into evidence. There
               are no witness, leads, or further investigation at this time. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and
               correct. Dated this 8th day of March, 2016, in Pullman,

               location. I responded to the library and contacted staff. They
               said a person entered the stairwell and had difficulty exiting
               causing multiple alarms. There was no emergency. No further
               investigation. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 8th day of March, 2016, in

               CITE/SECTOR# 1. Taylor, Timonae O (11/15/94) Property Returned
               2. Golden, Damon M (12/02/75) Returned Propery NARRATIVE: On
               03/08/16 around 1630 hrs I was asked to assist a female, later
               identified as Timonae O Taylor (11/15/94), in recovering her ID
               so she could board a flight on 03/17/16. I learned the ID was
               in possession of Damon M Golden, who is the owner of
               Stubblefields, and had been confiscated previously. I contacted
               Golden around 1830 hrs by phone and was told the following.
               Golden explained Taylor's ID had been seized when another
               female, who was not identified had tried to use it to enter the
               21 and over section of Stubblefieds Bar and Grill. He continued
               and told me Taylor's mother had tried to contact him in
               addition to Taylor. He continued and explained as a result of
               the rules he must follow for Liquor Control, the ID needed to
               be turned over to Liquor Control or Law Enforcement and could
               not be released to Taylor herself. After a brief conversation
               with Golden I explained I could document his releasing the ID
               to me and if Liquor Control had any questions it would be
               documented. Golden told me that would be fine and agreed to
               meet me a short time later were I took possession of the ID.
               After clearing Stubblefields with Taylor's ID I contacted
               Taylor and met her a short time later. Upon contacting her I
               explained Golden did not wish for anyone to get into trouble
               over this incident, but wanted me to speak with her regarding
               what happened and the possible legal issues surrounding it. As
               we discussed this Taylor told me she had been at Stubblefields
               with an unnamed friend when she dropped several items from her
               purse onto the floor. Her friend picked them up and placed them
               in her purse for safe keeping before Taylor walked into the 21
               and over section of the bar. A short time later her friend
               tried to enter using Taylor's ID at which point her friend was
               denied entry and Taylor's ID was seized. Taylor and I discussed
               this issue and the possible legal issues her friend could have
               been facing, as well as the position she put her and Golden in.
               Taylor told me she has already discussed this issue with her at
               length. We continued to speak for a short period of time after
               this before I returned her ID to her and we both cleared.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 8th day of March, 2016, in

               2059 hrs I was dispatched to a request for assistance in
               retrieving a vehicle which had been parked inside of the
               construction fencing at the old Bookie, and was now locked in.
               Upon my arrival I contacted the reporting party, later
               identified as Kiavany J Jones (12/21/94) and was told the
               following. Jones told me she had been in a rush earlier in the
               day and was running behind when she came onto campus. Upon her
               arrival she had previously parked in the metered parking lot on
               the North side of the old Bookie, and pulled in and parked. She
               left and went to class, and when she returned she noticed the
               gate had been closed and locked. I contacted Facilities
               Operations and asked them if they had a contact for the site
               manager of Absher Construction, which I had dealt with
               previously (See Case #: 16-W0639). After receiving the phone
               number for the site manager, Steve Sanislo I attempted to
               contact him and left him a message to contact me. After not
               being able to contact Sanislo I provided Jones with a courtesy
               ride back to her residence and told her if I heard from Sanislo
               before 2200 hrs I would call her. She told me that would be
               fine and thanked me for the help. Nothing further. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.

               I was dispatched to a malicious mischief call at Streit Hall on

               individuals smoking marijuana near his house located on the
               hill by Northside Residence Hall near Creston Ln. Pullman
               Police Department requested a WSU officer respond due to the
               location. Subjects smoking had already left when officers
               arrived on scene. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 03-08-16 at approximately 2117 hours Pullman
               Police Department (PPD) was dispatched to a report of a civil,
               located at 1005 NE Creston Ln. Dispatch advised the
               complainant, Gary B. Shelton (DOB 09-04-58), has been having
               issues with individuals coming to smoke marijuana and drink
               alcohol on the hill right by his residence. Dispatch advised
               Shelton has talked to the individuals in the past, and they
               normally leave but others usually show up. Dispatch advised
               there were individuals near his residence currently smoking
               marijuana. PPD Officer Doug Anderson requested I respond to the
               area because he thought the individuals smoking marijuana may
               be on campus property. As I was responding to the area Dispatch
               advised Shelton said the individuals had already left the area.
               Shelton was unable to get a description of any of them. I drove
               around the back parking lot behind Streit Perham, but was
               unable to locate anyone smoking marijuana. Ofc. Anderson
               radioed for me to meet him on the hill directly behind the end
               of Creston Ln. I met Ofc. Anderson and Shelton on the hill. The
               area on the hill they have been smoking at is directly north of
               Northside Residence Hall and just south of Creston Ln. They
               showed me a bunch of shrubs located directly behind Shelton's
               residence over the fence line. There was a large concrete
               platform located back behind the trees. Shelton says the
               individual's usually sit on it when the smoke and drink.
               Shelton said he has been finding individuals back there for the
               past two weeks. I told Shelton I would advise other officer's
               of the ongoing issue and we would conduct extra patrols in the
               area. Ofc. Anderson mentioned it might be a good idea to see if
               the undergrowth could be removed back there so it would make it
               harder for individuals to hide back there and smoke. He also
               said it would help eliminate the chance for a fire to start in
               the area when it begins to get dry again. I told Ofc. Anderson
               and Shelton I would send a copy of my report to WSU Grounds to
               see if they could do anything about the issue. I told Shelton I
               would get back to him if I heard if WSU Grounds would be able
               to do anything about the shrubs. I cleared the scene. No
               further action. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury

               who were contacted for smoking marijuana. 2 were forwarded to

               (11/06/96) Student Conduct Possession of MJ < 40 gm NARRATIVE:
               On 03/08/16 around 2120 hrs I was dispatched to a report of 3
               individuals who had been contacted by Hall Staff on the
               exterior stairwell of the 6th floor of Gannon Hall. Upon my
               arrival I contacted the reporting party, later identified as
               Andrew J Beck (06/22/91) and was told the following. Beck
               explained three individuals, who were cooperative, had been
               contacted on the exterior stairwell of the 6th floor of Gannon
               Hall for smoking marijuana. We continued up to the area where
               the individuals were and upon contacting them I activated my
               body camera and advised the males I was audio and video
               recording the contact. I walked up and an individual, later
               identified as Sean H Fareira (02/16/97), was holding what
               appeared to be a glass multi colored bong. I asked if all three
               of the individuals had been smoking marijuana and told only
               Fareira and David H Nguyen (11/06/96) had been smoking. The
               third individual, later identified as Daniel Reyes (02/16/97),
               told me he had just come back from the gym and contacted
               Fareira and Nguyen but had not been smoking with them. When
               asked if they had any remaining marijuana Fareira told me he
               only had a little bit left, which had been used between he and
               Nguyen. Both he and Nguyen also confirmed Reyes had not been
               smoking the marijuana with them. Fareira agreed to destroy his
               bong and prior to clearing I explained to both he and Nguyen
               this case would be forwarded to student conduct. They told me
               they understood and Nguyen and Reyes cleared. I provided Hall
               Staff with the case number for this incident and Fareira and I
               walked to the dumpster where he destroyed the bong before we
               both cleared. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 8th day of
               March, 2016, in Pullman, Washington.

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W1230 SYNOPSIS: Domestic Dispute between
               roommates at Steptoe Apartments. Subject punched roommate
               several times and threatened him. Subject was arrested and
               booked into the Whitman County Jail. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE

               4th DV/Harassment 2. NARRATIVE: On 03-08-16 at approximately
               2219 hours WSU Police were toned out to a report of domestic
               violence at Steptoe Apartments #G103, located at 1630 NE Valley
               Rd. Dispatch advised the complainant, Yao Zhou (DOB 08-28-89),
               said his roommate hit him and wanted to kill him. Dispatch
               advised Zhou was able to go inside of his room and lock the
               door. Cpl. Welter and I arrived on scene. Cpl. Welter spoke
               with Xiaolong Guo (DOB 01-03-89) inside of apartment #G103,
               while I spoke with his roommate Zhou (DOB 08-28-89) outside of
               the apartment. Ofc. Whitman soon arrived on scene as backup
               officer. I told Zhou that I was recording. I asked Zhou what
               happened. He told me him and his roommate Guo had got into an
               argument earlier about leaving their apartment doors left
               unlocked. Zhou told me that his roommate Guo was the last one
               to leave their apartment so he knew he did not lock the doors.
               He said he asked Guo to lock the door in the future when he
               leaves, but he said Zhou was very rude to him about it. Zhou
               said he did not want to fight with Zhou so he went to his
               bedroom. He said Guo then came and knocked on his door, and
               when he answered he threatened him. He said he again told Guo
               to just lock the door next time. Zhou said Guo pointed at him
               and they began to argue again. Zhou said then Guo hit him. Zhou
               made his right hand into a fist and motioned himself throwing
               punches in the air as he was telling me this. Zhou pointed to
               the left said of his face near his cheekbone. There were a
               couple of red marks on his cheek from where he had been
               punched, and it appeared swollen. I asked if Guo struck him
               with his fist, and he said yes. I asked him which fist Guo
               used, and he said his right fist and it was closed. Zhou kept
               referring to the punches as being "very heavy". Zhou mentioned
               Guo also said that he was going to kill him speaking Chinese.
               Zhou told me after that he called 911. I later took photographs
               of Zhou's injuries, and they were uploaded into Spillman. I
               asked Zhou how many times he was punched in the face, and he
               said about 10 times or maybe even more. I asked him if all the
               punches were on the same said of his face, and he said yes. He
               put his hands up near his face as if he was blocking punches,
               and told me he was doing that to protect himself as Guo was

               punching him. I asked Zhou if he fought back, and he said no
               that he never even touched Guo. I asked Zhou when Gou said that
               he was going to kill him, and he said as he was punching him in
               the side of the face. I asked Zhou if he thought Guo was really
               going to kill him, and he said no. Zhou said this just made him
               angry when he heard him say that. Zhou told me he called 911
               because he was afraid that if he did not report it, something
               similar would happen to him in the future. I went inside the
               apartment and spoke with Cpl. Welter. I told Cpl. Welter I had
               probable cause for the arrest on Guo. Cpl. Welter told me that
               Guo had already admitted to him to punching Zhou. I told Guo he
               was under arrest for assault 4th DV and harassment, and I
               placed him in handcuffs (double locked). I reminded Guo he was
               being audio and video recorded. I read Guo his Constitutional
               Rights from my department issued Miranda Warning card. Guo said
               it would be easier for him to understand if he just read my
               card. I let him read my Miranda Warning card. Guo told me he
               understood his rights, and he would answer any questions I had.
               There was a language barrier while speaking with Zhou and Guo.
               Guo told me that in China nobody calls the police when they get
               into a physical fight with their roommate. I placed Guo in the
               back of my patrol vehicle and transported to Pullman Police
               Department (PPD). Once I arrived at PPD I uncuffed Guo. I asked
               Guo if he said to Zhou that he was going to kill him in
               Chinese, but he said no. Guo said he just said something in
               Chinese that translates to "fuck you". I placed Guo in a
               holding cell. I later transported Guo to Whitman County Jail in
               Colfax, WA where he was later booked into jail for assault 4th
               DV and harassment. I turned all of Guo's property over to the
               correction's staff. I cleared the jail. I later filled out the
               Consular Notification form and faxed the form to the Embassy of
               People's Republic of China to notify them Guo had been
               arrested. The form was uploaded into Spillman along with the
               Probable Cause Booking Sheet. No further action. My Vievu
               camera was activated, and the video was later downloaded into
               the permanent digital evidence folder. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               9th day of March, 2016, in Pullman, Washington.

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Whitman / 323 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W1232 SYNOPSIS: Report of an overdose at
               Community Hall. Responded and place subject in protective
               custody. Pullman Ambulance transported subject to Pullman
               Regional Hospital. Nothing further. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 03/09/16 at about 0223 hours
               Pullman Ambulance was dispatched to an overdose at Community
               Hall room 76. Officer Tiengo and I responded. A female from
               room 75 said she had just been in the room 76 and called the
               ambulance. The female from room 75 said the subject, later
               identified as Madison Norman, was in the room and had taken
               pills and vomited. We knocked at the door and Norman said she
               was not dressed and wanted to put some clothes on. We continued
               to talk to Norman and it seemed she was stalling. I told Norman
               we were concerned for her safety and if she did not open the
               door we were going to key into the room. Norman opened the
               door. She was on her knees and she had vomit in her hair.
               Norman had something around her neck and there were scissors by
               her knees. The floor was also scatted with pills and vomit. I
               asked what was around her neck, she said she would get it off
               and reached for another pair of her scissors from her desk. We
               stopped her from getting the scissors. I was able to remove,
               what was determined to be clear "scotch" tape from around her
               neck. It was wrapped around several times and there were red
               marks on her neck. Officer Tiengo asked how the tape got on her
               neck and she said she did not remember. Officer Tiengo asked if
               she had taken any drugs, she said she had used all of her
               medication. She said she had two medications for depression and
               she had taken them all. There were also "advil" scattered
               around the floor. Officer Tiengo asked if she was trying to
               kill herself tonight, and Norman said yes. She said it was
               because her friend were saying she was "rude" and "crazy".
               There was also blood on Norman's hands. Officer Tiengo asked
               where the blood came from and she said she cut her hand trying
               to put batteries in her "dildo". Pullman ambulance arrived. I
               told Norman she was in protective custody and the ambulance
               would be taking her to the hospital. We were able to find three
               empty pill bottles and the ambulance crew collected them.
               Norman said she was also drinking "a lot of alcohol". She said
               she was drinking wine and vodka. She said there was still some
               vodka in her refrigerator. I asked if I could dump it out for
               her and she said I could and thanked me. I collected three
               scissors from the floor and confiscated them. I also collected
               the "advil" from the floor and threw the "advil" in the trash.

               Pullman ambulance transported Norman to the hospital. I went to
               the hospital and filled out the protective custody form. Norman
               had made some comments while talking to the ambulance crew that
               made me think she may have been a victim of a crime. She said
               boys had been trying to get her to send nudes and she also
               mentioned that guys were calling her "crazy". I returned to the
               hospital about hour after I had cleared the first time. I asked
               Norman about the comments she had made earlier. Norman said she
               had not been assaulted, threatened, or coerced in any way. I
               told her if she needed to report anything she could contact me,
               she said she had nothing to report and defiantly would if
               something had happened. I cleared the hospital again. I placed
               the three pair of scissors into evidence for safe keeping.
               Forward report to WSU counseling services. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
