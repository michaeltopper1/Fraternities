    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC:MTK/336 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W1135 SYNOPSIS: Report of an assault that
               occurred on B St. Pullman PD was notified. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 03/04/16 at
               approximately 1155 hours I was dispatched to an Others call.
               The reporting party, Randy Rosso, was reporting a post on a
               Facebook Page (WSU Parents) that stated a student was assaulted
               and the police didn't investigate. I called Rosso and asked him
               how I could help. Rosso explained that an Olivia Thuo had made
               a post on the Facebook Page stating that her daughter had been
               assaulted twice, one of which she reported to the police. Thuo
               went on to say that the police said they could not do anything
               unless they witnessed it. I told Rosso I would look into the
               matter and follow up with him. I checked the Facebook page and
               found the post. I saw that further in the comments of the post
               Thuo had claimed that her daughter had spoke with the Dean of
               Students and the matter was being handled. I called the Dean of
               Students and they said they had not spoke with anyone about an
               assault. I searched Thuo's name in MyWSU and found her
               information to include her daughter's name, Olivia W. Wainaina.
               I searched Spillman for both names and found that they were not
               in the system meaning they had not reported any crimes to the
               local police departments. I called Thuo and Wainaina and left
               messages for them to call me. I called Rosso back and notified
               him of my findings. Rosso said he was currently messaging Thuo.
               I asked Rosso to message Thuo to call me to discuss the matter.
               Thuo eventually called me and relayed the same information that
               she had put on Facebook. I told Thuo to tell her daughter to
               call me and report any assault that could have taken place.
               Thuo said she would do that. When I returned to work on
               03/05/16 at around 0700 hours I noticed that Wainaina was the
               reporting party of a drugs call the previous night (after I
               left a message). I went to Stephenson South room 729 to contact
               Olivia. I knocked on the door and it was answered by Olivia. I
               asked her why she did not return my call and she said she did
               not get my message. I explained why I was there and asked her
               to tell me what happened. Olivia explained that last week she
               had been walking near the taco stand at Mikes when she believed
               she was being followed. Olivia said she found a nearby officer
               and asked if he could keep an eye out because she felt she was
               being followed. I asked if she was assaulted at this time and
               she said no. Olivia said she waited around and her boyfriend
               met her. Olivia said that on 03/03/16 around 2130 hours she was
               walking north on B St. and was approached by an unknown female

               who punched her and ran away. I asked if anyone was with Olivia
               and she said no. I asked if anyone was with the other person
               and she said no. I asked Olivia if she reported it to the
               police and she said no. I explained to Olivia that the crime
               occurred in Pullman's jurisdiction so I would notify them to
               follow up with her and investigate. I provided Olivia with my
               business card. I notified Ofc. Crow about the case. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W1139 SYNOPSIS: "Lost" WSU Parking permit
               being used in a vehicle. Owner contacted. Investigation
               continues. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 030416 at approximately 1603 hours I was
               dispatched to the use of a "lost" WSU Parking Permit. I
               responded and met with parking staff. The informed me that on
               the same day the permit (GY1 5150) was reported lost another
               vehicle was added to the account. The account belonged to Lucas
               G. Engel (110896). I went to WSU Parking to gain some
               clarification as they were given me some information that made
               it seem there was a larger conspiracy. When I got there they
               confirmed that they had given me the wrong information and the
               case was simply the use of a lost permit. I called Engel who
               told me he was out of town. He said he had gone into WSU
               Parking as he was going to switch vehicles with his father and
               be using another vehicle. He told me that the other permit was
               in the other vehicle. I told him he had signed the WSU Parking
               lost permit form (attached to the case). Engel said he probably
               did not read it. Though I was only speaking with him on the
               phone, I did not detect any lies or evasiveness from Engel. I
               told him he could meet with Parking on Monday when he got back
               in town and I would follow up with him on the following
               Wednesday when I got back to work. I relayed this information
               to Chris Boyan. Case pending. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 5th day of
               March, 2016, in Pullman, Washington.

               prosecutors office and student conduct. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE

               Exhibiting 2. Noah A. Baum/022696 Fwd. Chgs. MIP Exhibiting
               NARRATIVE: On 03/04/16 at about 2251 hrs I was driving
               westbound on Cougar Way passing D St. when I noticed a female,
               later identified as Abigail C. Fenster (11199), who was laying
               on her back on the sidewalk next to parking services on D St.
               Fenster had two other people who were trying to help her get
               up, later identified as Noah A. Baum (022696) and a female, who
               was not identified. All three subjects appeared to be under 21.
               I asked how much Fenster how much she had to drink and she said
               "i have no idea". I asked what she was drinking and she said "I
               have no idea". She was able to answer most of my other
               questions correctly. I could smell the odor of intoxicants on
               Fenster's breath as she spoke. Even sitting down and leaning
               against a fence Fenster was having difficulty maintaining her
               balance and remaining seated upright. Fenster was clearly very
               highly intoxicated. Fenster provided me with her name and date
               of birth, which confirmed she was under 21. I had Fenster stand
               up again to see if she could stand on her own without
               assistance. She was unable to do so. As Baum was assisting
               Fenster he began vomiting. I asked Baum for his ID and how much
               he had to drink. He said he had "a little bit" and later
               admitted to having 5 beers. Baum provided me with his Driver's
               license. Baum was also having some difficulty maintaining his
               balance. He nearly fell over while opening his backpack to show
               me what was inside so I could confirm he had no alcohol in it.
               I could smell the odor of intoxicants on Baum's breath as I
               spoke to him. At about this time Fenster began vomiting. I had
               Dispatch call for an ambulance for an alcohol detox. I advised
               both Fenster and Baum I would be forwarding charges to the
               Whitman County Prosecutor's office for MIP Exhibiting. Pullman
               ambulance personnel arrived and transported Fenster to the
               hospital for detox. Baum was able to answer all my questions
               and appeared capable of caring for himself so he was released.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 05 day of March, 2016, in

               030516 Myself and Cpl. Boyd were requested to assist deputies
               with a Domestic on Whelan Road. The R/P stated that her son, a

               her residence. She stated that he had gotten upset and had been
               throwing items around the home. Upon our arrival we requested
               Lester come outside and he complied. Since Lester has been
               violent in the past he was detained and placed in hand-cuffs.
               Lester told me he was upset because his daughter wanted to stay
               at a friends home instead of him. He admitted to drinking a
               bottle of alcohol, but wouldn't tell me what. He provided a

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W1148 SYNOPSIS: Subject reported his
               bicycle stolen from a bicycle rack at Orton Hall. Bicycle was
               purchased locally, owner is going to get the serial number from
               the dealer. Investigation continues. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 03/05/16 at about 0101 hours
               Cougar Security reported they were approached by Sultan Al
               Mamari, who said his bicycle had been stolen. I responded to
               Orton Hall and talked to Al Mamari. He said his bicycle was
               stolen from the bicycle rack on the southeast corner of the
               building. Al Mamari said the last time he saw his bicycle was
               when he chained it up on Friday the 26th of February 2016. He
               was not sure of the brand of the bicycle and did not know the
               serial number. Al Mamari said he did purchase it locally though
               so he may be able to get the serial number from the bicycle
               shop he purchased it from. Al Mamari later sent me photographs
               of the bicycle. I can tell from the photos the brand of the

               POLICE DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W1149 SYNOPSIS: Dispatch advised
               an RED wanted phone contact about a drugs call at Rogers Hall.
               RED was unable to confirm an odor of marijuana. Nothing
               further. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 03/05/16 at about 0102 hours dispatch advised an RED wanted
               phone contact about a drugs call at Rogers Hall. I called RED,
               Jenafer Doolittle, and she stated an RA had done a lock out for
               a resident of Rogers Hall and when they keyed into the room
               they smelled the odor of marijuana. Doolittle stated the
               resident had prior contacts for marijuana and the last WSU PD
               officer that spoke with him said the next officer would
               probably come with a warrant. Doolittle asked if I could write
               a warrant off of the RA's contact with the room. I advised that
               she could go and confirm the odor and then I could come and
               talked to the resident but I would not be applying for a
               warrant in this incident. Doolittle called me back later and
               told me she was unable to confirm an odor of marijuana coming
               from the room. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 5th day of
               March, 2016, in Pullman, Washington.

               at the sixth floor. Corporal Boyd and I arrived and talked with
               the four males. I asked each of them how old they were and they

               had a medical marijuana card, they all said they did not. They

               on the ground they said they were smoking. I asked if they had
               any more marijuana and they said they did not. I asked if they
               had any other marijuana in their rooms, they said they did not.
               I had them destroy the roach on the ground. I explained I was
               warning all of them for possession of marijuana and I would be
               forwarding my report to student conduct. I asked if they had
               any questions, and they said they did not. Warned. Send to
