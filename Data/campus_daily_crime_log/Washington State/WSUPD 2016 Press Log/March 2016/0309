               screw was found in a vehicle tire. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On March 9, 2016 at about 0937
               hours I was dispatched to a report of suspicious activity
               resulting in a screw found in a vehicle tire. I contacted the
               complainant, Jack C. Kegerreis (10/14/68) by telephone as
               requested. Jack told me that his wife, Kelly Jo, found a screw
               in a tire on her vehicle today when she arrived at work at WSU.
               The vehicle was taken to Les Schwab where an employee told her
               that someone must have screwed the screw into the tire. Jack
               wanted this incident to be on record as it is a safety issue.
               He went on to tell me that their vehicle has been targeted for
               the past many months, but only on Tuesdays. Jack said the
               vehicle has been spit on, pop has been thrown on it, a fluid
               that resembled the bodily fluid of semen was thrown on it. A
               front bumper was scratched up sometime during the past months.
               The vehicle has been parked on Thatuna at the meters where the
               K house formerly was. This is adjacent to the construction area
               for the Old Bookie Building/Chinook. This is a heavily traveled
               area by foot traffic as well. Jack speculated that the vehicle
               and/or his wife was being targeted because the vehicle has
               Gonzaga University license plates, his wife is a doctoral
               candidate at Gonzaga, they are a military family and his kids
               are being targeted. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this ____ day of

               the RP and was routed to a phone tree that required a 10 digit
               code to leave a message. I didn't have a code to leave a

               hours, I was dispatched to contact Yal Shen Wang via phone
               regarding a theft report. I attempted to contact Wang and
               received a phone messaging tree. The messaging tree required a
               10 digit code to leave a message for someone and I didn't have
               the code. I asked dispatch for the whereabouts of Wang and was
               told he wasn't home and that they didn't know where Wang was. I
               checked the WSU Directory for Wang and there was nobody in the
               system named Yao Shen Wang. At approximately 1555 hours, I was
               talking to records when Wang called the police department. I
               asked if it was Wang and our records specialist told me it was.
               I spoke to Wang and he told me the following. The last time he
               saw his backpack was on 030616 at approximately 1700 hours. He
               stated his backpack was either in Dana Hall room 17 or in his
               vehicle parked in the yellow 3 parking lot at Spokane Street
               and College Avenue. Wang told me he believes it was in Dana
               Hall though. He stated he noticed his backpack was missing on
               030716 at approximately 1430 hours, and checked Dana Hall room
               17 and his vehicle and was unable to locate his backpack. He
               told me the contents of his backpack were his black Lenovo Y50-
               70 SN:CB32953050 valued at $900, his Tiawan Republic of China
               passport and several tax books valued at $100.00. Wang told me
               the backpack was a black nylon Cargus valued at $5.00. He told
               me he has only one other wireless device which is his Android
               cell phone with a MAC address of 40:B8:37:B5:63:64. Wang told
               me he believes his computer accessed the internet on 030916.
               Wang also told me there was an ebay listing for his exact
               computer. The listing number is #252302172500 and was listed by
               ebay screen name jlan8769 out of Pullman, WA. The auction is a

               form and sent it to WSUPD Records for NCIC entry on the
               computer. I spoke to Ofc. Jones and briefed him on the case,
               and asked him to follow up on the case. I sent an ebay message
               to the seller asking if I could look at the computer and
               possibly buy it in person. Case forwarded to Ofc. Jones for

               the damage was caused by Carlos Suarez driving his 2004 Ford

               On 030916 at approximately 1215 hours, I was dispatched to a
               report of a hit and run collision in the yellow 4 parking lot
               behind the Lewis Alumni Center. Upon arrival, I contacted Raela
               L. Hofmeister who told me the following. She parked her vehicle
               at approximately 0800 hours on 030916 and when she returned at
               1200 hours, she found the driver's side was damaged, and there
               was a note on the windshield indicating Kimberly Baker
               witnessed the collision and provided the suspect vehicle
               information and Baker's phone number. I checked the vehicle
               parked next to Hofmeister's and noticed it had the same license
               plate as the note indicated. The vehicle was a 2004 Ford Ranger
               belonging to Carlos Suarez. I checked the front passenger side
               bumper and noticed dark colored paint transfer and very minimal
               damage to Suarez' vehicle. I checked the damage to Hofmeister's
               vehicle and noticed there were paint transfer marks from the
               front of the rear driver's side wheel well to the driver's door
               handle. There was a large dent behind the driver's side door. I
               took pictures of the damage. I returned to WSU Police
               Department and contacted Carlos Suarez on his work phone. I
               explained to Suarez I was investigating a hit and run collision
               and asked him if he drove a silver 2004 Ford Ranger this
               morning. He told me he did. He stated he parked in the parking
               lot at approximately 0845 hours. I asked him if he hit anyone's
               vehicle and he told me he didn't know if he did or not, but
               didn't think so. I told him a witness saw him hit the other
               vehicle and walk away. He again told me he didn't know if he
               hit Hofmeister's vehicle. I asked him for his insurance
               information and he told me it was Allstate policy #976433734
               expiring 082816. I told Suarez to contact his insurance because
               Hofmeister will likely be calling them. I told him he needs to
               report vehicle collisions and he told me he would in the
               future, but he didn't realize he had hit Hofmeister's vehicle.
               I called the witness Kim Baker who told me the following.
               Around 0900 hours, she saw Carlos Suarez pull into the parking
               lot in his 2004 Ford Ranger pickup. As he pulled into the
               parking space next to Hofmeister's vehicle, she saw his front

               passenger side bumper hit Hofmeister's car. She stated he got
               out of the pickup and looked at the damage before walking away.
               She told me she felt he knew he caused the damage to the car
               because he looked at it before leaving. I thanked her for her
               time and cleared. Nothing further. I certify and declare under

               had been male or female, or which way they left. There did not
               appear to be any signs of forced entry. She speculated someone

               Brayden C (05/22/97) Warned Possession of MJ <40 gm. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 03/09/16 around 2115 hrs I was dispatched to a
               report of the odor of marijuana coming from room 1015 of
               Stephenson South. Upon my arrival I contacted the reporting
               party, identified as Andrew J Beck (06/22/91), and was told the
               followng. Beck explained he had been called about the odor of
               marijuana on the 6th floor of Stephenson South. Upon his
               arrival the source was narrowed and believed to have been
               coming from room 1015. Beck contacted Whitcom a short time
               later to report the incident. I asked him if there had been any
               previous contacts with the resident of the room and was told
               Hall Staff had not had any previous contacts with that room.
               Upon reaching the door to room 1015 I noticed the odor of
               marijuana in the air in the hallway. I smelled the crack in the
               door, which had air passing through it and noticed the odor I
               was smelling in the hallway appeared to be coming from inside
               of the room. I knocked on the door several times before the
               door was answered by a resident, later identified as Brayden C
               Cooley (05/22/97). I briefly explained why I was there and as
               we spoke I could smell the odor of burnt marijuana coming from
               within the room. Cooley and I continued to speak as I also
               noticed his eyes appeared to be red, with his pupils dilated
               beyond the darkness in the room would have called for.
               Initially, Cooley denied having smoked any marijuana and after
               I commented about his eyes he stepped back into the room and
               looked in the mirror before commenting to me they did not
               appear red to him. I explained they were and asked him if I
               could speak with him. Cooley invited me into his room where he
               later admitted to having smoked marijuana from a glass pipe. I
               asked him if he had any remaining marijuana in the room and was
               shown a small amount contained in a glass jar. We spoke about
               several options at which point he told me he wanted to destroy
               the remaining marijuana and pipe he had used to smoke the
               marijuana from. A short time later we went to the dumpster
               located outside of the building where Cooley destroy the
               remaining marijuana and pipe inside of the dumpster. I told him
               I would be giving him a warning for the marijuana and
               paraphernalia, however I would be sending the case to student
               conduct and he may be contacted by them. He told me he
               understood and I cleared a short time later. Nothing further. I
