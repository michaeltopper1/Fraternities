               approximately 2344 hours I was dispatched to the report of the
               odor of marijuana coming from room #606 in Streit Hall, located
               at 1620 NE Cougar Way. I arrived on scene. I met with the Hall
               Director on duty, Nicholas North (DOB 03-04-89), who told me he
               could smell the odor of marijuana coming from the room. I went
               to room #606 and I could smell the strong odor of burnt
               marijuana emitting through the crack in the door. I could hear
               several voices inside of the room. I knocked on room #606
               several times, and the voices inside the room all of a sudden
               got quiet. I asked North if he had the resident's names because
               I could hear them inside of the room, and he told me he could
               look them up for me. A few seconds later, a male later
               identified as Ian A. Salmon (DOB 11-13-96) answered the door. I
               told Salmon I was audio and video recording. I asked Salmon how
               many other people were inside of the room, and he said three
               others. There were three other males inside room #606 who were
               later identified as Yannick Y. Kwesele (DOB 04-04-97), Parker
               D. Vranizan (DOB 01-05-97) and Maurice S. Daum (DOB 04-17-97).
               I asked Salmon if anyone in the room was over the age of 21,
               and he said no. I asked if anyone in the room had a medical
               marijuana card, and he said no. I asked Salmon how much
               marijuana was in the room, and he replied "like half a gram". I
               asked all of them who the marijuana belonged to, and Salmon
               raised his right hand high in the air. I asked Salmon if all
               the marijuana belonged to him, and he said yeah and nodded his
               head up and down. I asked him who had been smoking, and he
               replied "me". I asked Salmon when he had been smoking, and he
               said about two hours ago. I told Salmon the odor of marijuana
               coming from the room was too strong, and I did not believe he
               had smoked two hours ago. Kwesele, Vranizan, and Daum would not
               admit to smoking with Salmon. I told them even if they had not

               out of. Salmon brought over a small glass jar containing a
               small amount of fresh marijuana. He also brought over a glass
               pipe with burnt marijuana residue. I told Salmon, Kwesele,
               Vranizan, and Daum that they would all be referred to WSU
               Student Conduct. They told me they understood. Salmon walked
               outside with me and disposed of his marijuana and glass pipe in
               a nearby dumpster. They were all polite and cooperative with
               me. I cleared the scene. No further action. My Vievu camera was
               activated, and the video was later downloaded into the
               permanent digital evidence folder. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 7th day of
               March, 2016, in Pullman, Washington.

 16-W1189 Domestic Dispute
        Complainant:
        
        
        Incident Address : 1340 NW STATE ST; lower; poss 10
                           PULLMAN              WA 99163

        Time Reported: 01:46
    Time Occurred between: 01:45:25 03/07/16 - 01:45:28 03/07/16

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Boyd/335 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W1189 SYNOPSIS: Pullman PD requested an
               agency assist at a domestic dispute because they were going to
               have a delayed response due to being out on another call.
               Officers responded and contacted the subjects involved before
               turning the scene over to PPD. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 03/07/16 at about 0146 hrs I
               heard Pullman PD toned out to a possible Domestic Dispute at
               1340 NW State St. #10. Pullman PD requested WSU officers
               respond because they were out of their vehicles at another call
               and would have to get back to their vehicles before being able
               to respond. Officer Tiengo and I responded to 1340 State St.
               The initial report was of yelling and some pounding sounds as
               well as a child crying. They believed the noises to be coming
               from apartment 10. Officer Tiengo and I went to apartment 10
               but we could not hear any noise coming from inside. I knocked
               on the door and a male answered the door. I could see a female
               and a young child inside. I asked to speak with them and told
               them we were there because we received the report of a possible
               argument occurring. The male said he believed there was an
               incident next door. However, the female had been nodding in
               affirmance of my statement about an argument as I was saying
               it. I asked if I could come in and speak with them and they
               said yes. Officer Tiengo entered and began speaking to the male
               while I asked the female what was going on. She seemed hesitant
               to speak in an area where the male could hear her. I asked if
               she wanted to move outside and she said yes. She put on a coat
               and shoes and started to go outside as Pullman PD officers were
               arriving. The investigation and interviews were turned over to
               Pullman PD at that time. Officer Tiengo and I remained on scene
               as backup. For further information see related PPD case.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 7 day of March, 2016, in
               Pullman, Washington. _______________________________________
