    Narrative: RVWD:MTK/336 OFC: JAK/333 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W1286 SYNOPSIS: A citizen called Whitcom
               stating she thought she observed someone breaking into an
               apartment in the Kamiak Apartments. I determined in was a WSU
               Housing Maintenance worker who entered the apartment with a
               paint roller on a pole. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1.
               2. NARRATIVE: On 03-11-16, Kristen P. Wedam (01-03-93) called
               Whitcom stating she believed she witnessed someone trying to
               break into an apartment in the Kamiak Apartment Complex. I
               contacted Wedam via phone and asked her to describe what she
               saw. She said she was driving down Hillside Drive and observed
               a male with something long in his hands. From her vantage point
               it appeared as if the male was trying to break into the
               apartment. She described the apartment as being in the second
               building back from Valley Road and the apartment closest to the
               Valley/Orchard play field. I responded to the Kamiak
               Apartments. I identified the building Wedam was speak of as the
               "B" building and the apartment was B-10. I knocked on the front
               door and a WSU Housing Maintenance worker answered with a paint
               brush in his hand. I could see a paint roller attached to a
               pole laying on the counter. I asked him if he brought the paint
               roller into the apartment with him this morning and he said he
               did. I determined this to be what Wedam had seen and cleared
               with no further action. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 11th day of March,
               2016, in Pullman, Washington.

    Narrative: RVWD:MTK/336 OFC: JAK/333 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W1289 SYNOPSIS: A WSU Student thought
               someone had taken her laundry from the Streit Hall laundry
               room, but janitorial staff had merely moved her clothes into a
               different dryer. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 03-11-16, Emily E. Blaire (03-21-97) placed her
               clothes in a dryer, located in the Streit Hall laundry room.
               After placing her clothes in the dryer, she went to her room to
               pack. Upon returning to the laundry room, she realized her
               clothes were not in the dryer she placed them. She called
               Whitcom to report the theft. Prior to my arrival to take her
               report, she had been contacted by custodial staff who advised
               her they placed her clothes in another dryer as they had been
               placed on a table in the laundry room and were still wet.
               Blaire verified all of her clothes were in the dryer and she no
               longer needed Police assistance. I gave her my business card
               with her case number written on it and asked her to call if she
               realized something was missing. Since all of her clothes were
               in a dryer, the theft is unfounded. Nothing further. I certify
               and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
               State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct.

               Geology Dept. No suspects or leads. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 03/11/16 at approximately 1145
               hours I was dispatched to a theft report at Webster Hall. I
               responded and spoke with the reporting party, Sophia A. Hutton
               (Administrative Manager School of the Environment). Hutton
               explained that Dr. Rosenburg (Philip Rosenburg) has a Geology
               Lab on the 10th floor (Room 1032). I asked Hutton if Rosenburg
               was available to talk with and she said he was and we went up
               to the 10th floor. As we exited the elevator, Hutton pointed to
               room 1032. I noticed the door was wide open and no one was
               inside the lab. I checked the door knob and found the door to
               be locked. Hutton took me to Rosenburg's office, which was
               around the corner and out of view of the lab. I asked Rosenburg
               to explain to me what happened. Rosenburg explained that he got
               gold rods back in the 60's for experiments he was doing.
               Rosenburg said that 3 days ago, he noticed that 6-8 of the rods
               were now missing. Rosenburg explained that he kept the rods in
               a wooden box with other gold and platinum rods. Rosenburg said
               the box was kept in a cabinet in his lab. I asked Rosenburg who
               uses the lab. Rosenburg said he and Kurt Wilkie are the only
               ones who use it. Rosenburg added that he is not doing any
               experiments right now, but they use the microwave and
               refrigerator that are in the room. I suggested to both (Wilkie
               walked around the corner from his office) that they keep the
               door shut unless they are in the lab. Rosenburg suggested that
               someone took the rods and could have sold them to a jewelry
               store. Wilkie explained to me that any jeweler would be
               suspicious if gold rods were brought to a store, since this is
               not a common item. I asked Rosenburg when he last saw the gold
               and he said in December of 2015. Rosenburg then said that last
               semester a person he assumed was a graduate student made a
               comment such as "I hear you have a lot of gold in your lab" to
               him. Rosenburg said that he can't see well (and noted that he
               couldn't see me sitting 2 feet from him) so he did not know who
               the person was. I asked Rosenburg to describe the gold rods to
               me. Rosenburg said they are about 18 inches long and 1/4 inch
               in diameter. I asked Rosenburg if he had other rods that I
               could see so I could have a better understanding of their
               description. Rosenburg said he gave the other rods to "Charles"
               to put in a safe. Rosenburg walked me to his lab and showed me
               where they were, which was a ground level cabinet, behind some
               equipment. Hutton and I met with Charles (Charles Knaack) who

               walked us to his lab on the 1st floor. Once inside Knaack with
               the assistance of another lab employee was able to open the
               safe that contained the gold and platinum rods. The rods looked
               like metallic straws. I found an 18 inch rod that was
               approximately 1/8 inch in diameter. I asked the lab workers to
               weigh the rod and determine an approximate value of the missing
               gold rods. Based off of the current market value of gold the
               approximate value of the rods missing is $15,000. There were
               many other gold and platinum rods in the wooden box,
               approximately 20-30 more rods of smaller diameter and mixed
               lengths. While investigating the case, I had several other
               employees, 3 of which said they've worked at Webster for 30
               years, tell me they didn't even know Rosenburg had gold in his
               lab. I provided Hutton with my business card and case number.
               There are no suspects or leads at this time. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               12th day of March, 2016, in Pullman, Washington.

               Ofc. Umbright later called me and said he spoke with the driver
               and passenger of the victim vehicle. Ofc. Umbright said the
               driver, Kayla Stowers, said she was traveling down hill in the
               inside lane. Stowers said when she passed Nevada St. the other
               vehicle struck the passenger side of her truck. Stowers told
               Ofc. Umbright that when they got to the intersection of Main
               St. her vehicle and the other vehicle stopped for the red
               light. Stowers' passenger, Joy Neal, went over to the other
               vehicle and told the other driver what happened and that they
               need to pull over. Both vehicles pulled over to the Man Shop.
               Stowers told Ofc. Umbright that when she told the other driver
               she was calling the police, he got in the car and left towards
               Moscow. Stowers provided Ofc. Umbright with the other vehicle's
               license plate number. A witness, Leila Styer, pulled over and
               told Ofc. Umbright that she was behind Stowers' vehicle and saw
               the other vehicle drift over into Stowers' lane and hit her
               vehicle. Moscow PD responded to the home of the registered
               owner of the other vehicle, Theresa Hanford. Hanford said that
               Bernard Austin has her vehicle and provided MPD with a phone
               number for him. On 03/12/16 at approximately 0800 hours Austin
               called and spoke with me. Austin explained that he was
               traveling down Stadium Way and as he was approaching Nevada St,
               the other vehicle passed him at a high rate of speed. Austin
               said he thought that the other vehicle collided with him at
               this time. Austin said he pulled over with the other vehicle.
               Austin said he gave the other driver his insurance card and
               when she said she was calling the police, he got back into his
               vehicle and left. Austin said that his passenger had
               "medicinal" stuff that he shouldn't have had so he figured he
               needed to get out of the state. Austin said his passenger was
               70 years old. I explained to Austin that it is legal in the
               state of Washington for his passenger to possess marijuana and
               it was actually illegal in Idaho for him to possess it. Austin
               said he did not know that since he was from Boston. I asked
               Austin for the insurance information, which he provided. I told

               Austin I would provide the other driver with his information
               and they could contact insurance companies to handle the
               situation. Austin said there was a dent on the driver's door of
               the vehicle he was driving, but said it was a 2003 van so he
               wasn't too worried. Austin said that the van would be at
               Hanford's residence after noon to take pictures. I asked Ofc.
               Warner (MPD) to respond to that location to take photos of the
               damage to Hanford's vehicle. I warned Austin for leaving the
               scene of a collision. I called Stowers who told me the same
               information that Ofc. Umbright relayed to me. I asked Stowers
               if the other driver gave her any information and she said no. I
               emailed Stowers Austin's information. Since there was an
               independent/unattached witness I did not attempt to contact
               Neal or Austin's passenger for their sides of the story. Ofc.
               Umbright took photos of the damage to Stowers' vehicle and
               saved them to his case. See Pullman case 16-P02521 for complete
               details of the initial investigation. I emailed Hanford
               Stowers' contact/insurance information. Investigation
               continues. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 12th day of March, 2016, in Pullman,

               NARRATIVE: On 031116 at approximately 1941 hours I was
               dispatched to a jumpstart in the Stephenson Parking Lot. I
               responded and met with the RP, Brianna Z. Kettel. She said her
               vehicle was having issues and had recently had Parking Services
               try to jump the vehicle with a jump pack but they were
               unsuccessful. A friend with jumper cables had been successful.
               It was a new battery so she was evidently having more
               electrical issues. We tried the jump pack and it helped restore
               some power but the vehicle would not start. I offered to take
               the battery back to our station to hook up to the charger. She
               said she would explore other options first. I provided her with
               the case number and dispatch's number if she needed us to
               charge the battery. I cleared. I later called back and they
               were unsuccessful in jumping the vehicle. I responded and
               extracted the battery from under the front seat. The battery
               was brought back to the station to charge, however, at this
               point it looks like the battery is fine. I instructed Kettel
               how to reach us in the morning to retrieve her battery. I later
               emailed Graveyard and Dayshift about the assistance she would
               probably need. Nothing follows. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 11th day of

               no odor of marijuana detected. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 03/12/16 at about 0018 hrs
               Dispatch advised hall staff at Orton Hall was reporting the
               odor of marijuana coming from room 1023. I responded and upon
               arrival at the room could smell what I believed to be the odor
               of pizza coming from the room. I knocked on the door and
               contacted the resident, Claire F. Hovde (091896). I asked if
               anyone else was in the room and Hovde said she had a guest. I
               told her I was there because I received a report of the odor of
               marijuana coming from her room. She said she did not have any
               marijuana in the room and neither did her guest. They both said
               they do not smoke marijuana. With the door open I could detect
               no odor of marijuana coming from the room but could still smell
               the pizza dough smell. I asked if they had pizza earlier in the
               night and she confirmed they did. I told her I didn't smell any
               odor of marijuana coming from her room while speaking with her.
               I thanked her for her cooperation and apologized for the
               inconvenience. Nothing further. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 12 day of

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Whitman / 323 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W1311 SYNOPSIS: Report of graffiti in the
               east stairwell of Gannon Hall. Spray painted graffiti on each
               floor. Investigation continues. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 03/12/16 at about 0140 hours I
               was dispatched to a report of graffiti in the east stairwell of
               Gannon Hall. I responded and found spray painted graffiti on
               the walls, ceiling, floor, and door in several places. There
               was some graffiti located each floor(first to sixth). The RA,
               Danielle Clark, said that the painting occurred between 2330
               and when she called. She said when they began their rounds at
               2330 the graffiti was not there and they discovered it at about
               0139. I photographed all of the graffiti. There was the name
               Davis on the sixth floor and a "D" with #24 under it on the
               sixth floor as well. There was a target on a step on the sixth
               floor that had been stepped on while it was still wet. The foot
               print left after stepping on the target left a paint print of a
               sole of "nike" shoe. There were the letters "TKE" on the fifth
               floor. There were no other distinguishing graffiti. I contacted
               Officer Emerson and asked if he had a contact number for the
               TKE fraternity and he provided a name and number for me. I also
               looked in local records for the name Davis associated with
               Gannon Hall. There were two individuals with the last name
               Davis that live at Gannon Hall. One of which lives on the sixth
               floor which was where the spray painted name was found. Evertt
               Davis was contacted at and listed as living in room 635 of
               Gannon Hall. I attempted to contact Davis at his dorm room.
               Davis had moved to room 407. I knocked on his door, he did not
               answer. I notified Facilities Operations of the graffiti.
               Investigation continues. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 12th day of March,
               2016, in Pullman, Washington.
