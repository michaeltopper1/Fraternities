               approximately 1330 hours I was dispatched to the odor of
               marijuana in Rogers Hall room 741. I called the reporting
               party, Ross McClure (Hall Director), and asked what was going
               on. McClure said he could smell the odor of marijuana on the
               7th floor and was able to pinpoint it to room 741. McClure said
               on a scale of 1-10 (with 10 being the most sure), he was a 7
               that the odor was coming from that room. McClure said he
               smelled other doors in the area and did not think it was coming
               from those rooms. I asked McClure on a scale of 1-10 how sure
               he was the odor was marijuana and he said a 10. I asked McClure
               when he last smelled the door and he said 5 minutes prior.
               While I was on the phone with McClure he again smelled the door
               and could still smell the odor of marijuana. I asked McClure
               how he knew the odor of marijuana and he said he has attended
               more than 9 controlled burns since he has been involved in
               Residence Life. I checked the history for room 741 and found
               that the police have been called to that room 3 times prior,
               with a search warrant being served there in February. The
               resident of the room, Joseph K. Walls 09/01/96, is under the
               age of 21 and is the sole occupant. I emailed Judge Robinson a
               search warrant, which he approved (see attached). Ofc. Jones,
               Intern Said, and I responded to Rogers Hall. While waiting to
               get on the elevator, Ofc. Jones told me Walls was walking to
               the elevator and the same thing happened the last time they
               came to execute a search warrant. When Walls showed up I
               explained that I had another search warrant for his room. Walls
               became upset and expressed that he was not in his room and he
               too smelled the odor and assumed the police would think it was
               his room. I explained to Walls that the report and probable
               cause came from hall staff. I told Walls that if I searched his
               room and there was no marijuana, then there was nothing to
               worry about. I walked with Walls to his room and began to read
               the search warrant, but he continued to talk over me and said
               he was calling his lawyer. I told Walls he could read the
               warrant to his lawyer and gave him the warrant. Ofc. Jones read
               Walls his Miranda Rights which I heard him say he understood
               and would answer our questions. I keyed into Walls room and
               began the search. I found the following items in the following

               locations: -A metal flask containing what smelled to me like
               rum. Located on the shelf on the south wall above the desk. -2
               picks with "Rosin" (a marijuana product that separates the
               resin from the plant using heat and pressure) residue on them.
               Located on the north desk. -Wax type paper with a substantial
               amount of Rosin. Located in a drawer of the north desk. -Large
               rubber container with separate compartments of Rosin. Located
               in a drawer of the north desk. -Small rubber container with
               Rosin inside. Located in a drawer of the north desk. -Grinder
               with trace amounts of GVM. Located in a backpack under the
               north desk. -Small plastic container with trace amounts of
               marijuana wax. Located under the bed on the south side of room.
               -Butcher knife with Rosin residue. Located on the north desk. I
               told Walls he was under arrest for Possession of Marijuana and
               MIP. I handcuffed (D/L) Walls and advised him he was being
               audio and video recorded. I told Walls that the rights Ofc.
               Jones read to him still apply and I could re-read them if he
               desired. I completed my search and issued Walls a criminal
               citation for Possession of Marijuana < 40 grams and MIP. I
               explained the citation to him and provided him a copy of the
               citation, the search warrant, and the items seized. I released
               Walls from custody. I returned to WSUPD and logged the items
               into evidence. I NIK tested the Rosin from the paper and it
               showed a presumptive positive result for the presence of
               Cannabis Sativa. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 7th day of March, 2016, in

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W1204 03/07/16 SYNOPSIS: Threats made to
               beat up a fellow student. Wanted to only make a report, no
               action/investigation wanted by complainant/victim. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On March 7, 2016
               at about 1439 hours Sgt. Kuhrt and I were serving a drug search
               warrant when we were advised of this threatening report. I made
               telephone contact with the complainant/victim as requested at
               about 1446 hours. The complainant/victim, Brooklynn N. Steiner-
               Martin (07/02/97), wanted to report that a male in her Fine
               Arts 102 class had threatened to beat her up because he didn't
               like her singing. The threat was made to her in person on
               Friday, March 4, 2016 at about 1600 hours. This happened in or
               during the Fine Arts 102 class. She was calling because she has
               that same class at about 1515 hours today. I asked Steiner-
               Martin if she had reported this at the time the offense
               occurred. She told me she talked to her teacher and WSU Student
               Conduct. This is the first time Steiner-Martin has made a
               report to the police. She told me she just wanted this
               documented. I asked her if she wanted me to speak to the person
               who made the threats. She said "no, it would make it worse." I
               again asked her if she wanted any police investigation or
               contact into this matter. Once again she said "No" and referred
               to WSU Student Conduct taking care of the matter. Steiner-
               Martin told me the male who made the threat is named "Ben" and
               he may be Samoan. She went on to say he is a gang member. I
               asked her if she is in fear of being beat up. She said she is
               taking it seriously but not in fear. Steiner-Martin again told
               me she just wanted to make a report. I asked her if she would
               provide me a written statement. Steiner-Martin told me she will
               send me an emailed statement. I do not have a statement as of
               this time. I told Steiner-Martin to call 911 if needed. I later
               received additional information from Whitcom, advising that
               they had been contacted by WSU Student Conduct regarding a
               potential name of the male who made the comments. The name
               provided is Alofagia Benjamin Faalavaau (06/21/97). I attempted
               to contact WSU Student Conduct but was not able to speak with
               anyone. The investigation continues. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W1206 SYNOPSIS: Request for a vehicle
               unlock. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Jenkins,
               Kemonee T (04/22/97) Owner 2. NARRATIVE: On 03/07/16 around
               1812 hrs I was dispatched to a request for a vehicle unlock on
               Cougar Way near the Northside Residence Hall. Upon my arrival I
               contacted the responsible, later identified as Kemonee T
               Jenkins (04/22/97) and was told the following. Jenkins
               explained he had locked the keys to the vehicle (Wa. B37071D)
               inside, and pointed to the cup holder inside of the vehicle. As
               I began to try to gain entry into the vehicle through the
               passengers side front door I maneuvered myself closer to the
               rear passenger side window in an attempt to see the door lock.
               As I was utilizing the unlock tool I heard a crunching sound
               from beneath my left arm. I looked down and noticed the after
               market plastic window shade had crushed beneath my arm. I
               completed unlocking the vehicle and after apologizing I
               photographed the damage. I explained to Jenkins what he needed
               to do in order to get the damage I had done repaired. I went on
               to give him Rick Fadness's name and we spoke about where to
               contact him. Prior to concluding our contact I gave Jenkins my
               business card along with the case number for reference and told
               him I would also forward this case to Fadness as well. Jenkins
               thanked me for the help in gaining access to his vehicle and I
               apologized for the damage before we both cleared. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this 7th day of March, 2016, in Pullman,
