    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: JAK/333 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W1155 SYNOPSIS: An unidentified person
               drew hate/bias pictures, symbols, and words on numerous
               bulletin boards and a maintanitence room door, on the ground,
               2nd, and 3rd floors of the east side of Stimson Hall. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 03-05-16,
               Normando A. Barbery (08-20-93) called Whitcom wanting to report
               malicious mischief occurred in Stimson Hall. Barbery requested
               an Officer call him prior to responding to the Hall to set a
               location to meet. I contacted Barbery and agreed to meet him in
               the Stimson Hall main lobby. Upon my arrival, Barbery informed
               me an unidentified person had written on several bulletin
               boards on the ground, 2nd, and 3rd floor of the hall in black
               ink. He said the writing was restricted to the east side of the
               hall and said it was all of a Hate/Bias nature. I walked with
               Barbery as we checked the hall to see what had been written on
               and what had actually been written. We went to the ground floor
               first and I saw the phrase "I EAT COCK" and a picture of a
               penis written in black ink on a bulletin board. I took photos
               of the malicious mischief as we went on. The next bulletin
               board we came to was still on the ground floor and was near the
               pool table. This bulletin board had a Swastika written on it in
               black ink, 2 penis's, the words Cock, Cunt, and Fuck, and the
               the phrases "Fuck the systen & GDI's", "Drunk Shit", "I Hate
               NIGGERS!!!". The next bulletin board I came to had the words
               Rape and Drunk written in black ink, several pictures of
               Penis's, 2 Swastika's, and picture of Breasts, and the phrases
               "Fuck Jesus & his weak minded followers God is not real", "Suck
               Dick", "I Hate Niggers & Jews", and "Jews runed the world". We
               then came to a mural showing 4 faceless men, which had been
               painted on one of the bulletin boards. The unidentified person
               drew several things near the heads of the faceless men as if
               they were thinking. The first one had the letter I with a heart
               and a Penis. This faceless male also had the words "Stupid
               Gays" written on the shirt. Between the first and second
               faceless male was a picture of Penis and the words Fuck, Cunt,
               Shit, Damn, and Nigger. The second faceless male had a Swastika
               drawn next to his head as if he were thinking it as well as the
               word "Nazis" written on his shirt. This is believed to have
               occurred between the hours of 0230 and 0845 on 03-05-16. More
               to follow. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under
               the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true
               and correct. Dated this ____ day of _____________, 2016, in
               Pullman, Washington. _______________________________________

               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 03/05/16 at approximately 0956
               hours I was dispatched to Stimson Hall room 327 for a drugs
               call. While I was en route I called the reporting party, Jena
               Doolittle, and asked what was going on. Jena explained that the
               occupant of the room where she smelled marijuana was leaving
               the building. I was driving up College Ave approaching Stimson
               Hall. Jena said the subject was wearing sweatpants and had
               white ear buds. A subject matching that description exited
               Stimson Hall with Jena following. I approached the male and
               explained I was called for him smoking marijuana. The male,
               later identified as Hamad I Alsowail, said that he hangs out
               with subjects that smoke marijuana and that was where the odor
               was coming from. I asked Alsowail how much marijuana was in his
               room and he said 2 buds. Alsowail said I could come up to his
               room, and I followed him up. While walking up I could smell the
               odor of fresh marijuana coming from Alsowail. When we got to
               his room, I asked Alsowail if he had any marijuana on him and
               he said he had 2 joints and gave them to me. Alsowail then said
               I could search him, which I did, finding another blunt in his
               jacket. Alsowail said I could search his room, which I did,
               finding nothing further. I explained to Alsowail that I would
               be warning him this time, but expect to be arrested if there
               were any further calls about him using marijuana. I returned to
               WSUPD with the joints and logged them into evidence for
               disposal. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 5th day of March,

               run. I called the RP/victim, Caitlin R. Downey, and arranged to
               meet her at her car. I met Downey at Blue Lot 1. Her vehicle
               was in the 3rd lowest tier across from Yakama Village
               apartments. She had last seen her vehicle undamaged on 030316
               at approximately 1230 hours. She had no suspects or leads. I
               did not see any vehicle in the area that may have been

               point of impact which was located at the driver's side rear
               bumper ($500). The bumper was still attached but had been
               pushed in 3-4 inches with numerous scratches. Downey had
               already been in touch with her insurance company. I provided
               her with my business card and her case number. I wrote
               dispatch's non-emergency number on the back of my card in case
               she saw any vehicle in the parking lot that appeared to have
               been involved. Downey asked about camera's in the lot and I
               informed her that there were none but that she should feel free
               to voice her opinion on the matter to WSU. I took photos of the
               damage and the vehicle. I cleared. Case closed pending any
               development. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing

               The reporting party was unsure if it was supposed to have been

               Conduct Marijuana NARRATIVE: On 030616 at approximately 0044
               hours I was dispatched to the odor of marijuana coming from a
               room as detected by hall staff. I responded and spoke with RED
               Doolittle. She directed me to room 113. The smell could only be
               detected by placing my nose next to the door. I knocked on the
               door and Patrick E. Patel (090396) answered the door. We had
               met the day before. He denied knowing anything about the
               marijuana and said he had only just gotten back to his room.
               Asked who else was in the room and he said 2 others. I told him
               to grab everything they were not supposed to have and their ids
               and exit the room. Patel complied but the other 2 residents did
               not. They took several minutes to exit after Patel's prodding.
               The 2 remaining were Anthony M. Cann (091996) and Treon L.
               Triggs (022697). The 2 denied there was anything else in the
               room that they should not have and that they had smoked
               elsewhere. Both had a milky film on their tongue. They stated
               Patel had not been involved with the marijuana. As I smelled
               the odor of alcohol from the two, I recommended they stay
               inside. I told them they would be referred to Student Conduct.
               I provided Hall staff with the case number and cleared. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and

               Rojas/020897 Fwd. Chgs. MIP Exhibiting & False Statements 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 03/06/16 at about 0050 hrs I was driving
               eastbound on Cougar Way when I noticed a group of three people
               who were walking eastbound along Cougar Way. They caught my
               attention because one of the females in the group, later
               identified as Scarleth Rojas (020897), appeared to be under 21
               and was stumbling side to side as she walked. At one point she
               nearly stumbled into the roadway. As I passed the group another
               female said, "Oh Shit" when she saw me and they quickly turned
               and walked the other direction while Rojas continued eastbound.
               I contacted Rojas at the south east corner of the Lower Soccer
               Field. I asked how much she had to drink and she said "not
               much". I asked if I could check her eyes to see how much she
               had to drink and she agreed. I administered a horizontal gaze
               nystagmus test on her. I observed she had bloodshot an watery
               eyes a lack of smooth pursuit and a distinct and sustained
               nystagmus in both eyes. I could smell the odor of intoxicants
               on Rojas' breath as I administered the test. I asked Rojas for
               her name and initially she gave me the name Kelciy M. Rodrigec
               with a birthday of 03/10/97. She hesitated several times while
               providing me the name and date of birth. She also spelled both
               the first and last names in a very odd manner. I told Rojas I
               believed she was lying about her name and gave her the
               opportunity to be honest with me. She provided me with the name
               again in the same manner. I asked why she was having to think
               about how to spell her own name. I told her if she was lying to
               me she was going to be arrested for that. I told her to provide
               me with her real name and she again gave me the name Kelciy M.
               Rodrigec. I ran the information provided by Rojas and Dispatch
               advised there was no return. I told Rojas there was no return
               and that I knew she was lying to me about her name. She then
               provided me with her actual name and date of birth. I told her
               I was going to be forwarding charges to the prosecutor's office
               for MIP Exhibiting and making false or misleading statements
               and Rojas was released. Nothing further. I certify and declare

               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Mackenzie L. Vogel/051793 Warned Theft
               2. NARRATIVE: On 03/06/16 at about 0115 hrs I was driving
               eastbound on Valley Rd. near Brandy Way when I saw a female,
               later identified as Mackenzie L. Vogel (051793), walking/riding
               a bicycle down the sidewalk. I recognized the bicycle as one
               that had been sitting against a tree in front of Kamiak
               apartments for several days. As I reached Kamiak Apartments I
               noticed the bike was no longer leaning against the tree where
               it had been. I turned around and noticed Vogel had left the
               bicycle laying near the bus stop at the intersection of Valley
               Rd. and Brandi Way. The bicycle was a multi colored kids bmx
               type bicycle. Vogel and a group of people who were not
               identified were walking up Brandi Way. I stopped and contacted
               Vogel. I asked if she was the one riding the bicycle and she
               said yes. I asked if it belonged to her and she said no. I
               asked why she took the bicycle and she said because it was just
               sitting by the side of the road. Speaking with Vogel I noticed
               she had bloodshot and watery eyes. She spoke with slurred
               speech and was unsteady on her feet. It was clear she was
               intoxicated by alcohol. I asked for her ID and Vogel provided
               me with her Washington Driver's license. She said she could
               return the bicycle and I told her that would be a good idea.
               She walked down, retrieved the bicycle and returned it to the
               area where it was previously. I warned her for theft and she
               was released. Incident sent to student conduct only. Nothing

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Boyd/335 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W1175 SYNOPSIS: Subjects flagged me down
               due to a friend who was making suicidal comments and having a
               "breakdown". Pullman PD responded and took the subject into
               protective custody. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 03/06/16 at about 0131 hrs I was driving
               eastbound on Valley Rd. approaching Brandi Way when I noticed
               two female's trying to flag me down at 1425 NE Valley Rd. I
               stopped and they advised me their friend, Nathan W. Whited, was
               having some sort of breakdown and was threatening to kill
               himself. They directed me to a small field behind the residence
               just to the west of 1425 Valley. There were three subjects in
               the field. Whited was laying on his side and quite visibly
               upset and intoxicated. There were two other people with him. I
               began speaking with Whited about what was going on. He told me
               he was having problems. When asked to elaborate he told me he
               is in the military and doesn't really know what he wants to do
               with his life. I asked Whited if he made any statements to his
               friends about harming or killing himself. He denied making any
               such statements. As I was speaking with Whited he was sobbing
               and at one point began vomiting due to his alcohol consumption.
               Pullman PD arrived on scene and I continued speaking with
               Whited while they talked to his friends. Officer Harris took
               Whited into protective custody and transported him to PRH for
               evaluation. For additional information see related Pullman PD
               Case. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of
               perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 06 day of March,
               2016, in Pullman, Washington.

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: Boyd/335 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W1176 SYNOPSIS: Pullman PD received a
               report of a hit and run. I saw the vehicle leaving the area and
               made a traffic stop on the vehicle. Pullman PD responded and
               took over the investigation. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE
               CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 03/06/16 at about 0155 hrs I
               was turning on to Cougar Way from Stadium Way when I heard
               Pullman PD being dispatched to a hit and run that just occurred
               on Spaulding St. near Kamiaken St. the report was of a silver
               Ford Focus that backed into another vehicle and left the area
               toward Colorado St. At the time the call was being dispatched I
               noticed a silver Ford Focus that was pulling up to the stop
               light on Cougar Way at Stadium Way. I turned around and as I
               was pulling up behind the Ford Focus Dispatch advised Pullman
               the reporting party provided a license plate of AFP7629 for the
               suspect vehicle. The vehicle in front of me had the same plate.
               I began following the vehicle as it crossed through the
               intersection and turned on to Gaines Rd. Dispatch then advised
               the vehicle should have damage to the rear driver's side bumper
               with white paint transfer. I could see the vehicle I was
               following had matching damage and paint transfer. I initiated a
               traffic stop on the vehicle and it stopped in a driveway at
               1310 Gaines Rd. I contacted the driver, Calvin R. Green
               (101195), and told him the reason for the stop. He denied
               backing into another vehicle. I asked for his driver's license,
               which he provided. I waited for Pullman PD to arrive on scene
               and the investigation was turned over to Pullman PD Officer
               Perez. For additional information see related Pullman PD case.
               Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury
               under the laws of the State of Washington, that the foregoing
               is true and correct. Dated this 06 day of March, 2016, in
