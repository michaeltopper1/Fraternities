               NARRATIVE: On 030216 at approximately 1006 hours, I was
               dispatched to a report of a semi truck parked on the sidewalk
               near the new WSU Police Department. The trailer of the truck
               was loaded with huge concrete supports and the trailer was
               parked over the steam tunnel. The concern was that the tunnel
               would collapse under the weight of the trailer. I contacted the
               construction workers and they had the truck moved. Nothing
               further. I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under

               being done down the hall where they were cutting drywall. He
               figured the white powder was likely drywall dust on their
               clothes when the workers were using the bathroom. I cleared.

               vehicle in the Red 2 lot at Indoor Practice Facility. NAME/DOB
               ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On March 2, 2016
               at about 1255 hours I was dispatched to an found property in
               the Red 2 lot at the Indoor Practice Facility. I responded to
               the area where I was contacted by WSU Parking Services
               personnel. They told me the following information. The Red 2
               permit, RD2525, displayed in the black Honda Pilot, 552YKR/CT,
               was reported as lost on February 4, 2016. A paper temporary
               permit was provided to Tao. The temporary permit expires on
               March 31, 2016. A temporary permit was issued because WSU
               Parking Services ran out of their Red 2 permit inventory. I
               later learned from WSU Parking personnel that Tao did not sign
               a lost/stolen affidavit. It is unknown if she was provided
               verbal and/or written instructions on returning the lost permit
               to WSU Parking Services if found. The vehicle had been wheel
               locked by WSU Parking Services prior to my arrival. The front
               driver's side wheel was locked. There were two (2) WSU Parking
               tickets issued to the vehicle for displaying a lost/stolen
               permit and for a wheel lock. A sticker had been placed on the
               windshield of the vehicle on the driver's side. The vehicle was
               displaying Red 2 permit, RD2525, on the interior of the
               windshield on the driver's side. Digital photographs of the
               permit and vehicle were taken. The temporary paper permit
               issued by WSU Parking Services was not being displayed, just
               the original lost static cling permit. I attempted to contact
               the registered owner, Haiying Tao (12/26/75) by telephone and
               at her Johnson Hall 253 office. I was not successful in making
               contact. The investigation continues. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               hours I was dispatched to a male stuck in the elevator at
               Northside Residence Hall. I responded to the building where an
               unknown male was stuck in elevator #1 on the 5th floor. An
               elevator technician responded and freed the subject. I was not
               able to identify the male. A piece of garbage stuck in the
               outer elevator door caused the elevator to stop working. It did
               not appear to be done in malice. The elevator technician said
               it is a common problem in the elevator business. No further

               at approximately 1424 hours, I was dispatched to a report of
               marijuana coming from room 235 Rogers Hall. Prior to my
               response, I checked spillman and noticed Cpl. Edwards was
               dispatched to that same room on 012016 for the odor of
               marijuana, but she was unable to confirm the odor and nobody
               answered the door. As I approached the door, there was a strong
               odor of fresh marijuana in the hallway and it got stronger as I
               approached the room. The door to 235 opened and the smell of
               fresh marijuana was extremely intense. The male, later
               identified as Jesse Maiwald, had his hands behind his back and
               dropped a can of air freshener on the floor. I asked him what
               the air freshener was used for and he told me the hallway
               stinks and he was going to freshen it up. I asked Maiwald if he
               knew why I was there and he told me he didn't. He looked
               extremely nervous and his hands were shaking. I explained to
               him that I smelled the odor of marijuana coming from his room.
               He told me he has been in trouble in the past and that he was
               staying clean. I asked him who else lives in the room and he
               told me he was the only resident of 235. I asked for his ID and
               he provided me with his WADL. I explained that he had two
               options in handling the situation. I told him he could destroy
               the marijuana and get sent to student contuct. The other option
               is he could refuse and I could apply for a search warrant. If
               it was granted, I would search his room and hold him
               accountable for anything found. He told me he didn't have any
               marijuana in his room or in his backpack. I asked him if I
               could search his backpack or room and he told me he didn't want
               me searching his stuff. I explained to Maiwald he was going to
               be sent to student conduct for the odor of marijuana coming
               from his room. He told me it was going to screw his school
               diversion and that he couldn't afford to get in trouble. I
               explained that he could have cleared it all up with consenting
               to a search, but in the end, Student Conduct would be notified
               of the incident. Forward to Student Conduct. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: mjp/327 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W1099 SYNOPSIS: Subject's rear window of
               his vehicle smashed while parked at Playfield. No suspects or
               leads but possibly related to sporting activity. Risk
               Management notified. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 030216 at approximately 2013 hours I was
               dispatched to a smashed vehicle window at Valley Rd playfield.
               I called the Rp as requested and then met him at the
               playfields. The vehicle, a black Nissan 240, was parked in the
               western parking lot closest to Merman Dr. The rear of the
               vehicle was facing the playfield and the rear window had be
               broken. It appeared contact was made at the juncture of the
               window and the weather stripping. There was a circular pattern
               to the broken glass that would be about the size of a softball.
               No softball was seen in the immediate area but there was one on
               the other side of the fence, on the field. The RP, Michael J.
               Wiens (062094), stated he had last seen his vehicle undamaged
               at approximately 0800 this morning and then found the broken
               window at approximately 1800. The vehicle did not appear to
               have been broken into. I told Wiens I could not definitively
               say that the window had been broken from playfield activity but
               it was probable. I told him I would inform Risk Management and
               I provided him with Rick Fadness's contact information. I later
               emailed Rick. Wiens was provided with my business card and his
               case number. I cleared. Nothing follows. I certify and declare
               under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this

               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W1106 SYNOPSIS: Report of a text message
               scam. The reporting party blocked the number. Contact was
               attempted with the subject, but there was no answer.
               Investigation continues. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR#
               1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 03/02/16 at about 2159 hours I was
               dispatched to a harassment call. The reporting party, Shara
               Leaders, received text messages saying the person texting her
               had nude photos of her. The person texting her wanted her to
               video chat with her with an online video chat site. The suspect
               threaten to post the nude photos to Facebook if she did not
               comply within 5 minutes. She said she was at her residence,
               Columbia Apartments N45, to meet or for phone contact. I called
               and spoke with Leaders. I asked if there she had ever taken
               nude photos that the suspect may have. She said there was not,
               she stated she "does not do thing like that". I told her she
               should block the number and check her security settings on her
               Facebook account. I also told her she could post a message on
               her Facebook page saying that someone was attempting to scam
               her as a warning to her friends and family if the scam went any
               further. I asked Leaders if she could take screen shots of the
               text conversation and email them to me. She said she could and
               did. I attached the conversation. I called the number that had
               been texting Leaders and no one answered and no voicemail
               picked up. This type of scam sounded familiar to me. I recalled
               Cpl. Edwards working a similar case last year. I searched and
               found two similar cases 15-W5847 and 15-W6272. In case 15-W5847
               the I searched the Internet for information on the number. I
               found reference to the number being associated with address in
               Mathews Corner, WA. I looked up Mathews Corner, WA in google
               and it plotted near Eltopia, WA on West Eltopia Rd. I searched
               Spillman for anyone with an address on Eltopia Rd. I found four
               names. One of which was a suspect in a Pullman PD case from
               2015(15-P03765). This case involved a female being coerced with
               threats of continuing an Internet post of her in a pornographic
               video. Investigation continues. I certify and declare under
               penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington,
               that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this ____ day of
               _____________, 2016, in Pullman, Washington.
