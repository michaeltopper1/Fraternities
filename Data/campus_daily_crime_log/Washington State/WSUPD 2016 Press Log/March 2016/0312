    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: JAK/333 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W1314 SYNOPSIS: 3.31 grams of marijuana
               were collected from Stimson Hall, room 327 B. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. Hamad Alsowail / 11-15-96 WARNED
               V.U.C.S.A 2. NARRATIVE: On 03-12-16, Andrew J. Beck (06-22-91)
               called Whitcom stating he smelled the odor of marijuana coming
               from within Stimson Hall, room 327B. Beck is the Residential
               Educational Director for Stimson Hall and wanted and Officer to
               respond to Stimson Hall to deal with the situation. Sgt. Kuhrt
               and I responded to Stimson Hall and met Beck on the 3rd floor.
               I asked him to tell me what was going on. He said Stimson Hall
               is open during Spring Break, but hall staff were still mandated
               to conduct room checks. While they were doing so in room 327 B,
               they smelled a strong odor of marijuana. Rather than
               questioning to room occupant, they called Whitcom. I walked
               down the hallway to room 327. The door was ajar so I knocked.
               No one came to the door so I began yelling "Hello" and "Come to
               the door please". Sgt. Kuhrt then yelled "Hamad". A short time
               later a male, identified as Hamad I. Alsowail (11-15-96), came
               to the front door. I asked him if he knew why I was at his
               door. He said he had no idea. I asked again and he said he had
               just been asleep and had no idea. I asked him if hall staff had
               recently been in his room to conduct a room check and he said
               they had. I asked him what they may have smelled when they were
               in his room. At this point, Alsowail asked if I would like to
               come in. Sgt. Kuhrt and I entered the common area of room 327
               with Alsowail's permission. As we were entering the common
               area, Alsowail said something to the effect of "I have already
               been contacted by an Officer and I swear I have nothing." As
               Sgt. Kuhrt and I neared Alsowail's room, we could both smell
               the odor of fresh marijuana. Alsowail admitted to being 19
               years old. After a bit more questioning, he admitted to having
               "Made a mistake" and said he had marijuana in his room. He
               volunteered to get his marijuana out of his room and give it to
               me. He went to his room and got a clear glass mason jar which
               had marijuana contained in it. I explained to Alsowail a Police
               report would be completed and forwarded to the WSU office of
               Student Conduct. Sgt. Kuhrt and I exited the room and notified
               hall staff of what happened. I weighed the marijuana when I got
               back to the Police Department and determined there was 3.31
               grams of fresh marijuana. I logged the items into evidence and
               locked it in locker number 13. Nothing further. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
