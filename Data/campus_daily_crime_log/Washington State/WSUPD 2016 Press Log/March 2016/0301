    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: JAK/333 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W1063 SYNOPSIS: A WSU student reported
               his car as being stolen from a parking lot on the Pullman
               campus. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE:
               On 03-01-16, Benjamin P. Johnson (10-12-95) called Whitcom
               stating his 1997 Honda Civic had been stolen. He wanted an
               Officer to respond to the Green parking lot between Beasley
               Coliseum and the WSU Student Recreation Center. I responded to
               the parking lot and met Johnson. I asked Johnson to explain
               what was going on. He told me he had driven to Pullman from
               Montana on Sunday evening (02-28-16) and had parked his car in
               the parking lot at approximately 1800 hours. When he returned
               to the parking lot on 03-01-16, his car was gone. I asked him
               to describe his car. He said it was a forest green, 1997 Honda
               Civic. He said the license plate was WA/AVB7302. He said there
               was a crack in the front windshield, a chunk out of the front
               bumper, which was being held together with a piece of wire, and
               a crimson WSU Cougar sticker centered on the upper portion of
               the rear windshield. I asked him who the registered owner of
               the car was and he said his mother, Tracy L. Johnson, was. He
               said he had called her just prior to calling 911 and his mother
               has no idea what happened to the car. He said he only has 1 set
               of keys for the car and they have never left his possession. He
               said he has a parking permit so he does not believe the car
               could have been towed for any reason. He also said he is
               positive he parked the car in the parking lot at approximately
               1800 hours on 02-28-16. He has no idea where his car is or who
               could have moved it. Johnson read and signed a Washington State
               University Police Department "Stolen Vehicle Form", which will
               allow the vehicle to be signed as stolen and entered into NCIC.
               When I returned to the Police Department, I gave a copy of the
               "Stolen Vehicle Form" to our Records staff so they could enter
               it as "Stolen" in NCIC. Johnson had pictures of the car on his
               phone from when his mother purchased the car, which he e-mailed
               me. I downloaded the photos into the "Files" section of the
               report. No suspects or leads at this time. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               1st day of March, 2016, in Pullman, Washington.

               1028 hours, I responded to the Regents Complex, room 107 for an
               unknown medical issue. Whitcom stated a female was in the room
               acting unusual. Upon my arrival, I identified the patient as
               Jill M. Roberson (09-22-96). Roberson was laying on her bed,
               rolling from her back to her side, crying, and saying her back
               hurt very badly. Roberson was in obvious pain and having
               trouble catching her breath. She said she was diabetic and was
               not sure what was causing her lower back pain. She said her
               lower back had hurt all morning and was progressively getting
               worse. Roberson's roommate, Sydne B. Fernandes (07-25-97) said
               Roberson had not eaten anything and has never seen her in so
               much pain. She said she was not aware of her falling or hitting
               her back. The City of Pullman Fire Department arrived on scene
               and determined Roberson needed to be transported to Pullman
               Regional Hospital for further evaluation. Nothing further. I
               certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of
               the State of Washington, that the foregoing is true and

               who identified himself as Cheng Li with his cougar card. I
               asked him if he had a driver's license and he told me he had a

               explained to him he needed his permit with him and a driver
               with at least 5 years driving experience when he is practicing
               driving. He told me he didn't understand that law and that he
               would make sure to follow the rules from now on. He explained
               he was just practicing driving and that he was trying to do so
               out of the way of other traffic. WSU Police Intern Pacer Said
               parked his car safely and he was released with a warning.

    Time Occurred between: 15:46:20 03/01/16 - 15:46:20 03/01/16

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: BRW/325 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W1073 SYNOPSIS: Subject called requesting
               an investigation to possible intimidation of a public servant
               violations. NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2.
               NARRATIVE: On 03/01/16 at approximately 1620 hours I was
               dispatched to others call where Thomas G. Taylor 10/14/85
               wanted to report criminal activities that has occurred through
               the WSU Global Campus. I called Taylor who stated he is a
               Global Campus student which means he takes online courses and
               does not live in Pullman, WA. Taylor stated that he had been
               part of the Global Campus government body. Taylor stated that
               while he was employed with WSU he witnessed WSU employees
               intimidate the President of the student government into
               committing "communications" policy violations. Taylor continued
               to tell me about different issues for the next 10 minutes. It
               was very hard to follow what Taylor was saying because he was
               jumping around in his story and speaking in a very excited and
               fast paced manner. I told Taylor that he was conveying a lot of
               information that was very hard to take down. I asked Taylor if
               I could send him an email version of our statement form. Taylor
               said that was a good idea. I told Taylor to fill out the
               statement form with all of his evidence and information on the
               suspected crimes. Taylor also stated that he believed that
               someone may have hacked his email account because he has
               emailed his complaints off to various departments within WSU
               but has not received any replies. Taylor suspects someone is
               blocking his emails from reaching their destination. Taylor
               sounded to be very paranoid about the situation. Taylor stated
               he would fill out the statement form and get it back to me as
               soon as possible. While waiting for Taylor's statement, I
               emailed the Vice President of WSU Global Campus, David R.
               Cillay, asking for assistance regarding the situation. At 1815
               hours I received a phone call from Cillay. I did not provide
               Cillay with Taylor's name and asked him if he knew who I was
               referring to. Cillay without hesitation provided the name,
               Thomas Taylor. Cillay stated that for the last year and a half
               they have been dealing with Taylor. Cillay stated Taylor had
               been a senator for WSU government when he and his President had
               a minor argument. Ever since then Taylor has been making
               accusations against WSU Global Campus. Cillay stated that
               Taylor is suing WSU under a tort claim. Cillay also stated that
               this issue has been already been handled by OEO, HRS, the
               President's Office, and WSU's Attorney General. Cillay stated
               he would pass my email onto Attorney General Terry Ryan who is

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: ENW/328 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W1077 SYNOPSIS: Report of an internet
               scam. Victim already reported the incident to Western Union.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On
               03/01/16 I was dispatched to a reported fraud which had
               occurred in room 335 of McEachern Hall. I contacted the
               reporting party, later identified as Steven J Degiogi
               (12/14/94) and was told the following. Degiogi explained he had
               recently received a friend request from a female he did not
               know, whose screen name was Ashleah Wang Higgins, on Facebook.
               He accepted the request and began to chat with her. During the
               course of the conversation she suggested they chat over Skype,
               which Degiogi agreed to. During the conversation on Skype,
               Higgins convinced Degiogi to remove his clothing. A short time
               later he was told this encounter had been recorded and would be
               released unless he paid $5000.00. Degiogi told me he was not
               concerned about the money, but was more concerned about his
               reputation. As I was speaking with him I noticed he was
               receiving several messages over facebook requesting he go to
               Skype. I asked him during one of the phone calls to allow me to
               answer it. Upon answering the call I found the line
               disconnected and returned the phone to him. We continued to
               speak and I asked about the money requested from him. He told
               me he wired 2 separate transactions to an individual named
               Juanito Rodrigo and Jayson Villaganes. The total was $3000.00,
               and upon checking on the wire transfers he learned they had
               been received in the Philippines. I explained this was part of
               a scam currently going on and he needed to report the account
               on Facebook as fraudulent and the same for the Skype account.
               In addition I told him if he were to receive any further
               contact to inform the subject he was speaking with he had
               reported the incident to the police. Prior to leaving I
               provided Degiorgi with my business card and case number for
               reference. I also asked him to contact Western Union and try to
               obtain any additional information regarding this transaction
               and was told he would. Around 2200 hrs I spoke again with
               Degiorgi and was told he contacted Western Union regarding this
               case. They were working on it and told him there was a chance
               he would be able to recoup his money as a result of the fraud.
               I again asked him to contact Facebook and Skype and was told he
               would. I again explained due to the transactions going overseas
               I would not be able to track it and I would need he to block
               the username. I later attempted to locate an account for
               Higgins, Rodrigo, and Villaganes, on both Skype and Facebook

               struck the parking booth arm and drove off. NAME/DOB ACTION
               OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 03/01/16 around 2042
               hrs I was dispatched to a report of a vehicle which struck the
               traffic arm at the parking booth to the Holland Parking Garage.
               Upon my arrival I spoke with the booth attendant, later
               identified as Aira J Jose (05/08/93), and was told the
               following. Jose, explained she had been working at the parking
               booth when around 2015 hrs she had just finished a transaction
               for a vehicle which was getting ready to leave. The parking arm
               went up and the vehicle, which she could not describe began to
               leave. At this point a second vehicle, which Jose could only
               describe as a sedan, and possibly brown in color, drove out
               right after the first vehicle. The parking arm came down and
               struck the vehicle as it continued out of the parking lot. Once
               it had reached the intersection of Cougar Way she told me she
               believed the vehicle turned East and continued out of the area
               before she contacted her supervisor, Christian C Leigh
               (08/21/88), who was instructed to contact the WSU Police. I
               photographed the traffic arm and did not notice any indication
               of paint on it. A short time later I contacted Facilities
               Operations to remove the remainder of the control arm before
               clearing. Upon returning to the WSU Police Department Ofc
               Whitman and I attempted to locate video footage of the vehicle
               in question. Upon reviewing the video from the camera on Global
               Scholars Hall I could see where Ofc Westerman in the last
               vehicle to go into the parking garage when the control arm is
               still in place. A short time later the wind picks up and the
               street signs and other control arm can be seen bending in the
               wind before the control arm on the exit disappears from view.
               Upon reviewing this footage no vehicle is visible at the time
               when the arm is damaged and I recommend this case be closed as
               unfounded. Nothing further. I certify and declare under penalty
               of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington, that the
               foregoing is true and correct. Dated this 1st day of March,
               2016, in Pullman, Washington.

    Narrative: RVWD: / OFC: DBT/321 WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE
               DEPARTMENT CASE #: 16-W1083 SYNOPSIS: I assisted Pullman Police
               Department with a single vehicle collision which occurred on NE
               Orchard Dr. near NE Valley Rd. Driver was arrested for DUI.
               NAME/DOB ACTION OFFENSE CITE/SECTOR# 1. 2. NARRATIVE: On 03-02-
               16 at approximately 0024 hours I was on patrol in the area of
               Valley Rd. I was traveling eastbound on Valley Rd. in my patrol
               vehicle when I came around the corner that turns into Orchard
               Dr. I saw a silver, 2000 Honda CRV (WA Lic. ACV9254) with
               significant damage to it blocking my lane of travel and a
               female sitting in the driver's seat. There was vehicle debris
               and other objects that had been inside of the Honda at one
               point all over the roadway. There were multiple bystanders on
               the sidewalk, and a female standing next to the Honda and
               talking with the driver. I activated my emergency lights and
               exited my patrol vehicle. I approached the Honda. The female
               that was standing next to the Honda was later identified as
               Jael M. Swanson (DOB 10-23-94). I asked Swanson if she knew the
               driver, and she said no. Swanson told me she saw what happened
               though. I asked the driver of the Honda, who was later
               identified as Alyse S. Erickson (DOB 11-09-93), if she was
               okay. However, I had to ask her multiple times before she
               responded and told me she was fine. I asked her if she had any
               injuries, and she said no. I did not see any visible injuries
               on Erickson, but I still radioed Dispatch to have medics
               respond to the scene. I asked Erickson if she was wearing her
               seatbelt at the time of the collision, and she said yes she
               was. I told Erickson medics were still going to respond to
               check on her even though she said she was not injured. I asked
               Erickson what happened, but she would not answer me but just
               began to cry. She had a photograph of a male in her hand and
               just continued to cry and stare at it. I told Erickson I was
               audio and video recording. I could smell the strong odor of
               intoxicants coming from the vehicle. I saw an large empty
               stemware glass in the back seat of the Honda. WSUPD Intern
               Tyler Peters was riding along with me at the time, so I
               requested he back up my patrol vehicle to caution other
               driver's of the collision. I radioed Dispatch requesting other
               units to assist with traffic control. I also asked Dispatch if
               they could see if a Pullman unit wanted to respond to handle it
               because the collision occurred in their jurisdiction. I told
               Erickson to wait in her vehicle until medics responded to check
               on her. I asked Erickson for her driver's license, vehicle
               registration, and proof of insurance and she provided them to

               me. Erickson also removed her keys from the ignition and just
               handed them to me. Ofc. Whitman soon arrived on scene to assist
               with traffic control. I asked Swanson what she saw happen.
               Swanson told me she saw the Honda traveling northbound on
               Orchard Dr. and saw the vehicle traveling in the oncoming lane
               of traffic and then watched the vehicle hit the curb over near
               Cove Way. Swanson said the vehicle then swerved back to the
               correct lane of travel and then came to a stop in the oncoming
               lane of travel near Swanson's house. I asked the other nearby
               bystanders if they witnessed anything, and a male later
               identified as Beau A. Marshall (DOB 06-20-93) told me he did.
               Marshall told me he was walking on the sidewalk on Orchard Dr.
               heading northbound walking up the hill near the Student
               Recreation Center (SRC). Marshall said the Honda appeared to be
               traveling at a very high rate of speed. He said it sounded like
               the vehicle went off into some gravel and then possibly hit a
               curb. Pullman Police Department Ofc. Cornish arrived on scene.
               I told Ofc. Cornish what the witnesses had told me. I told him
               I could smell the odor of intoxicants coming from the vehicle
               and that Erickson appeared intoxicated. Swanson and Marshall
               both provided me with written statements of what they had
               witnessed. Ofc. Cornish began administering field sobriety
               tests. Although Pullman medics soon arrived on scene, so he
               stopped the tests while they checked on Erickson. Pullman
               medics determined Erickson did not need to go to the hospital.
               Ofc. Cornish completed the field sobriety tests and arrested
               Erickson for DUI. I gave Ofc. Cornish the written statements
               the witnesses provided me with. Ofc. Whitman and I stayed on
               scene to assist with traffic control until the impound of the
               vehicle was complete. We cleared the scene. My Vievu camera was
               activated at the time, although due to technical difficulties I
               am unable to download my video at this time. I certify and
               declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
               Washington, that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated this
               2nd day of March, 2016, in Pullman, Washington.

               approximately 0036 hours I was dispatched to a drugs call at
               McEachern Hall room 433. The RED on duty, Jenafer L. Doolittle,
               was reporting the odor of marijuana coming from the room. Upon
               arrival I knocked on the door and Kaysie L. Culbertson 11/16/93
               answered. When Culbertson opened the door I could smell the
               strong odor of burnt marijuana coming from within the room . I
               told Culbertson that even though she was over 21 years old, she
               could not possess marijuana in the dorms. Culbertson agreed to
               destroy her marijuana. Also in the room was Dakota G. Surovchak
               03/29/95. Surovchak is under the age of 21 but he said he did
               not smoke any marijuana. Culbertson, Surovchak, and I walked to
               the dumpster where Culbertson threw away approximately 2 grams
               of fresh marijuana. Once destroyed I explained the rules
               regarding marijuana to Culbertson and Surovchak as well as the
               student conduct process. I told the two they were free to go
               and I cleared. END OF REPORT I certify and declare under

               On 03/02/16 around 0037 hrs Ofc Burkett of the Pullman Police
               Department requested I assist Ofc Winegardner, who was at Adams
               Mall for an assault investigation. Upon my arrival I spoke with
               Winegardner who asked me to watch two individuals who were
               believed to have been suspects in the assault case he was
               investigating. He continued and told me he was going to review
               the video footage inside of the establishment, and I remained
               outside with the males and two females, who were also involved.
               A short time later Winegardner returned and after speaking with
               the males released them before walking over to speak with the
               females. One of the females was upset and could not believe
               Winegardner was not going to arrest the males for calling her a
               prostitute among other things. Winegardner explained the other
               female had assaulted one of the males, who did not wish to
               press charges. He continued and obtained the females
               information before we both cleared. Nothing further. I certify

               Apartments. Upon arrival we found unit B9's front door wide
               open. We searched the apartment and found nobody inside. The
               apartment was vacant and it was clear nobody had lived in it in
               a long time. There was no visible damage to the unit. We locked
               the front door and the door secured without issue. The door
               most likely opened due to the high winds we were experiencing.
