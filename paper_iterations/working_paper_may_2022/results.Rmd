# Results \label{section:results}

In this section, the estimated causal effects of a fraternity moratorium on alcohol offenses and sexual assaults are reported using OLS. Figure \ref{diff_average_offenses} serves as a preview of the main results by plotting the distribution of differences between the number of offenses per-25000 enrolled students on moratorium days and non-moratorium days. On average, most universities observe less alcohol offenses and sexual assaults on moratorium days as displayed by the dashed line.

## Main Results

Table \ref{main_table} reports that fraternity moratoriums lead to substantially lower alcohol offenses across university campuses while showing suggestive evidence of decreases in sexual assaults. Column (1) shows the baseline specification from Equation \ref{main_model}. This baseline specification includes day of the week, holiday, semester, football game-day, and academic-year fixed effects. Moreover, columns (2) and (3) show results from progressively adding more flexible fixed effects, although recall from Section \ref{section:strategy} that column (2) is the preferred specification. In Panel A, alcohol offenses decrease during moratorium days relative to non-moratorium days in the academic-calendar. Across the three specifications, an average moratorium day exhibits between 26 to 28 percent less alcohol offenses in comparison to an average academic-calendar day as shown in the point estimates. These estimates are statistically significant across each specification, maintaining that moratoriums decrease campus-wide alcohol offenses. Although alcohol offenses are robust, sexual assaults fail to achieve statistical significance across each specification and the magnitude of each effect varies considerably; sexual assaults show a 14-20 percent reduction from the mean across the three specifications. 

The effect of moratoriums are most evident during the weekends (Friday-Sunday), consistent with the literature that most college partying occurs on weekends rather than weekdays [@lindo_college_2018]. Table \ref{weekend_table} shows the preferred specification from Table \ref{main_table} separated by weekends and weekdays; the column All Days corresponds to the estimates of column (2) from Table \ref{main_table}. During the weekends, alcohol offenses decrease by 28% relative to an average academic-calendar weekend as shown in Panel A. On the other hand, weekdays show no statistically significant decreases. Likewise to alcohol, sexual assaults show larger decreases on the weekend in comparison to weekdays in Panel B. A weekend during a moratorium can expect 29% fewer sexual assaults relative to an average academic-calendar weekend.

Importantly, these results are robust to a variety of robustness and sensitivity tests. First, given the non-negative count nature of the offense data and the sensitivity of OLS estimation to outliers, Appendix Tables \ref{main_table_p} and \ref{weekend_table_p} show consistent results to Tables \ref{main_table} and \ref{weekend_table} using poisson estimation in lieu of OLS. Specifically, poisson estimation shows a statistically significant 27 and 32 percent average reduction for alcohol offenses and sexual assaults on the weekends respectively. Second, to ensure that the results described above are not driven by a single university, Appendix Figures \ref{loo_alc_ols} and \ref{loo_sex_ols} show leave-one-out coefficient estimates for each offense. In particular, 37 unique regressions are estimated for each offense, omitting one university within each iterationâ€”all which demonstrate similar findings to the main results. Finally, recall from Section \ref{section:strategy} that negative weights occur in the difference-in-difference estimator when treated units are used as control groups. Given that the sample includes only treated universities, I include 14 additional universities in the sample that never underwent a moratorium in the period of analysis to potentially mitigate the negative weighting issue. This amounts to 51 total universities for a total of approximately 75,000 academic calendar days. Each of the additional universities are chosen from the Colleges with the Best Greek Life list on Niche.com.^[I use Niche.com since it is the top search result on Google when searching for the ``best fraternity colleges''. The Princeton Review, notable for its annual list of party schools, does not a list regarding fraternity life.] Never-treated universities are selected if they are regarded as a Top 50 Greek Life school.^[Notably, it is known that at least one university (Chico State) had a moratorium outside of the sample period (2013). This, however, only further validates the selection of the never-treated universities.] However, 17 of these universities are already included in the sample due to experiencing a fraternity moratorium. As such, 14 of remaining 33 Top 50 Greek Life universities are able to provide Daily Crime Logs for the 2014-2019 period. Appendix Table \ref{weekend_table_allschools} shows the effects of moratoriums when including these never-treated universities. Overall, the results remain similar, with weekend decreases of alcohol of approximately 18 percent reduction from the mean and sexual assault decreases at approximately 26 percent.
