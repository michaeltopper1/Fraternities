	abstract = {Recent statistics indicate that 25 percent of all female college students will experience some form of sexual assault by the time they graduate. Even that figure is probably an underestimate, since many women who are assaulted drop out of school. Very few of these incidents are reported, and when they are, campus authorities often mishandle the case, causing further trauma to the victim. Of the small number of cases pursued through campus judicial procedures or reported to the police, only a fraction result in conviction. Why does no one seem to know what to do about the problem of sexual assault on campus? Why do so few women report their assault? Why are so many cases mishandled? Why do some college administrators so fear being sued that their fear becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy? Why are some institutions better equipped to handle the problem, and what is the best way to handle sexual assault on campus? Carol Bohmer and Andrea Parrot, both recognized experts on the problem of rape, particularly acquaintance rape, examine these and other questions in this landmark book. Sexual Assault on Campus combines social science evidence, analysis of legal doctrine and cases, and interviews with victims, their parents, campus security officers, and college administrators. Based on the results of their own qualitative study on the responses to complaints of sexual assault on campus, the authors offer important new guidance to all involved in the problem, particularly administrators, lawyers, and service providers working with students - from rape crisis centers and social workers to residence hall directors. Further, Sexual Assault on Campus includes case studies, making it important readingfor students of social work, criminology, and law and society programs. And certainly victims of campus rape, their families, and friends will want to read this book - the first ever to deal effectively with the aftermath of sexual assault on campus.},

This study examines whether joining fraternities and sororities improves academic performance. In order to account for the self-selection bias of Greek membership, I exploit plausibly exogenous cross-class variation in Greek student composition at the course-instructor level. My estimate shows that a 10 percentage point increase in Greek student composition translates to a 0.02 standard deviation increase in course grade for Greek students relative to non-Greek students. I further find that this effect is driven largely by low-achieving and middle-achieving white Greek members.},

	abstract = {Limited research has examined sexual victimization among U.S. college men, and particularly fraternity men. We report the prevalence of sexual assault (SA) victimization among a sample of college fraternity members and the sociodemographic variables associated with this victimization. In April 2018, we conducted a web-based survey study among a random sample of fraternity members (n = 102) from a list of all fraternity members at a large Midwestern university. We used Fisher’s exact tests, Student’s t-tests, and log-binomial regression models to assess associations between sociodemographic variables and any SA victimization (attempted or completed penetrative sexual assault). Over a quarter (27.5\%) of respondents reported experiencing any SA victimization—penetrative sexual assault (13.7\%) or attempted penetrative sexual assault (25.5\%)—since entering college. Age, school year, and being on a varsity sports team were significantly associated with any SA victimization (p-values: {\textless}.01, {\textless}.01, and .02, respectively). Regression analyses showed older fraternity men had experienced significantly greater prevalence of any SA victimization compared to younger fraternity men (prevalence ratio [PR]: 2.78, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.35–5.73). Furthermore, any SA victimization was also more common among varsity sports team members (3\%) compared to nonmembers (0\%). These findings indicate that college men, particularly fraternity members, may experience sexual assault victimization at high rates. Our more inclusive survey language may have captured sexually violent experiences that traditional measures have not, such as “made to penetrate” experiences. We encourage the use of queries that are sensitive to the specific characteristics of male sexual violence victimization, including experiences of nonconsensual sexual activity where the victim is either the penetrated or the penetrator. Furthermore, prevention efforts and supportive services for survivors should be expanded to better address male SA victimization on college campuses.},

Alcohol-related behavior does not explain much of the effects of fraternity membership on either the human capital or social capital effects.

Methods: The survey included measures of attitudes towards sexual violence, knowledge of IPV resources, and participation in IPV prevention activities. Results: Fraternity members with unofficial houses were more accepting of sexual violence than nonmembers, whereas fraternity members with official houses were exposed to more IPV prevention messages than nonmembers. Conclusions: Results highlight the importance of considering fraternity house status as a risk factor for sexual violence. Unofficial houses that are not regulated by the university may be particularly problematic for IPV.},

Results: Public institutions with higher tuition, more liquor violations, and greater numbers of fraternity men and athletes were more likely to report rape on their campuses.

	volume = {69},
	doi = {10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2012.132},
	abstract = {Context Despite empirical links between sexual revictimization (ie, experiencing 2 or more sexual assaults) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), to our knowledge, no epidemiological studies document the prevalence of sexual revictimization and PTSD. Establishing estimates is essential to determine the scope, public health impact, and psychiatric sequelae of sexual revictimization.
Objective To estimate the prevalence of sexual revictimization and PTSD among 3 national female samples (adolescent, college, and adult household probability).
Design Surveys were used to collect data from the National Women's Study–Replication (2006; college) as well as household probability samples from the National Survey of Adolescents–Replication (2005) and the National Women's Study–Replication (2006; household probability).
Setting Households and college campuses across the United States.
Participants One thousand seven hundred sixty-three adolescent girls, 2000 college women, and 3001 household-residing adult women.
Main Outcome Measures Behaviorally specific questions assessed unwanted sexual acts occurring over the life span owing to the use of force, threat of force, or incapacitation via drug or alcohol use. Posttraumatic stress disorder was assessed with a module validated against the criterion standard Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV.
Results About 53\% of victimized adolescents, 50\% of victimized college women, and 58.8\% of victimized household-residing women reported sexual revictimization. Current PTSD was reported by 20\% of revictimized adolescents, 40\% of revictimized college women, and 27.2\% of revictimized household-residing women. Compared with nonvictims, odds of meeting past 6-month PTSD were 4.3 to 8.2 times higher for revictimized respondents and 2.4 to 3.5 times higher for single victims.
Conclusions Population prevalence estimates suggest that 769 000 adolescent girls, 625 000 college women, and 13.4 million women in US households reported sexual revictimization. Further, 154 000 sexually revictimized adolescents, 250 000 sexually revictimized college women, and 3.6 million sexually revictimized household women met criteria for past 6-month PTSD. Findings highlight the importance of screening for sexual revictimization and PTSD in pediatric, college, and primary care settings.},

When the population size of an aggregate unit is small relativeto the offense rate, crime rates must be computed from a small number ofoffenses. Such data are ill-suited to least-squares analysis. Poisson-basedregression models of counts of offenses are preferable because they arebuilt on assumptions about error distributions that are consistent withthe nature of event counts. A simple elaboration transforms the Poissonmodel of offense counts to a model of per capita offense rates.

Unlike classical statistical tests, these tests require specification of only the mean-variance relationship under the alternative, rather than the complete distribution whose choice is usually arbitrary. The optimal regression-based test is easily computed as the t-test from an auxiliary regression. If a distribution under the alternative hypothesis is in fact specified and is in the Katz system of distributions or is Cox's local approximation to the Poisson, the score test for the Poisson distribution is equivalent to the optimal regression-based test.},

Beginning with Poisson and compound Poisson models, which involve strong assumptions, a variety of possible stochastic models and their implications are discussed. A number of estimators and their properties are considered in the light of uncertainty about the data generation process. The paper also considers the role of tests in sequential revision of the model specification beginning with the Poisson case and provides a detailed application of the estimators and tests to a model of the number of doctor consultations.},

Methods: In 2016 we compared the rate of 2010–2013 youth (18–24 years) emergency department (ED) visits for injuries in Hospital Service Areas (HSA) with and without fraternities and sororities. ED visits were identified in the State Emergency Department Database (n=1,560 hospitals, 1,080 HSAs, 16 states). US Census Bureau and National Center for Education Statistics sources identified HSA population and campus (n=659) characteristics. A proprietary database identified campuses with fraternities and sororities (n=287). ED visits explicitly linked to fraternities and sororities in the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System–All Injury Program were used to identify injury causes for sub-group analysis. Results: HSAs serving campuses with fraternities and sororities had lower age 18–24 injury rates for all causes except firearm injuries (no difference). Conclusions: Fraternities and sororities were not associated with a higher injury rate at the population level among undergraduate-age youth. A major limitation is not being able to observe campus health services utilization.},

	abstract = {Background: Alcohol-related rape among university students is clearly a major concern. However, there have been no large-scale surveys of the prevalence of this offence among university students in the UK. The aim of the current paper is to investigate the prevalence and characteristics of alcohol-related rape among university students in seven universities in Wales.Methods: All universities in Wales were approached to take part in the research. Eight of the nine universities agreed to take part and seven universities emailed their students as planned. On the launch date, emails were sent by the universities to all students requesting that they take part in the survey. The email contained a link to a questionnaire covering a range of topics including: demographics, lifestyle factors, and substance misuse.Results: In total, 7,846 students submitted a questionnaire. Overall, just under six per cent of females reported being the victim of alcohol-related rape while at university compared with one per cent of males. Sexual orientation was significantly correlated with alcohol-related rape, with three per cent of heterosexuals reported being the victim of alcohol-related rape, compared with eight per cent of lesbians or gays. Students who drank alcohol frequently and those involved in binge drinking were also significantly more likely to report the offence.Conclusions: The government and universities should play a more direct role to ensure that actions are taken to deter, prevent, and treat the consequences of these largely unreported offences.},

Campus party culture has been shown to influence risk of other types of victimization, and there is reason to believe it may also influence drugging victimization. Using three behavioral indicators of participation in the campus party culture—binge drinking, Greek life membership, and first-year student status—this study estimates the main effect of each indicator, and their interaction, on undergraduates’ rates of drugging victimization. Estimating a generalized linear model using a large random sample (N = 6,931) from three universities, results show that each party culture variable and their three-way interaction significantly influenced students’ rate of drugging victimization. Sorority members who were first-year students and binge drank at least once in the past month had significantly higher rates of drugging victimization compared to all other groups of students.},

The current paper aimed to examine if barriers to disclosure may be more salient to sorority women. Participants: We examined differences in rates of hypothetical willingness to formally disclose (N = 693) and actual formal/informal disclosure (N = 584) as well as mental health as a function of Greek-life status among college women. Method: Two separate online surveys were administered (October, 2016; January, 2017), respectively. Results: Findings suggest no significant differences in rates of hypothetical or actual formal/informal disclosure as a function of Greek-life status; however, Greek-life members reported lower mental health. Conclusion: Findings from the current studies suggest that institutional factors (e.g., campus climate) may serve as a barrier to disclosure.

An analysis of the norms and dynamics of the social construction of fraternity brotherhood reveals the highly masculinist features of fraternity structure and process, including concern with a narrow, stereotypical conception of masculinity and heterosexuality; a preoccupation with loyalty, protection of the group, and secrecy; the use of alcohol as a weapon against women's sexual reluctance; the pervasiveness of violence and physical force; and an obsession with competition, superiority, and dominance. Interfraternity rivalry and competition-particularly over members, intramural sports, and women-encourage fraternity men's commodification of women. We conclude that fraternities will continue to violate women socially and sexually unless they change in fundamental ways.},

The present study applies identity theory to patterns of casual sex and dating at college, more predominantly known as hookup culture, to examine how the “partier” identity shapes drinking, partying, and hooking up. More specifically, we incorporate structural and perceptual control aspects of identity theory, expecting to find that commitment to, salience of, and endorsement of meanings associated with the “partier” identity will increase hookup likelihood. In doing so, we move beyond a public health discourse of hookup “risks” and frame this sexual behavior as a form of identity verification deeply embedded in social relationships and the self. We utilize two waves of data collected six months apart from 19- to 27-year-old college students at a large, southeastern public university (n = 197). Path analyses were conducted in which we control for characteristics typically associated with hookup culture, finding limited effects of demographic characteristics (e.g., race, drinking, and Greek life membership) on behavior. Instead, we largely find support for the proposed direct and indirect effects of identity theory’s concepts, collected at Wave 1, on hook up behaviors at Wave 2.},

Drawing from routine activity theory, low self-control, and social learning theory, this study tested a theoretical model that identified pertinent factors present among sorority environments to determine the relationships between Greek affiliation and sexual assault. Path analyses revealed that sorority women reported consuming more alcohol and with greater frequency, increased risk-taking behavior, delayed assessments of threat and responses to risk, and increased contact with fraternity men—all of which significantly predicted sexual assault. Future theory, research, and policy directions are proposed.},

While these social gatherings provide an opportunity for interaction and new relationships, the environment is often constructed in a manner that reinforces traditional gender roles and increases the overall risk of sexual assaults. For some females, the attainment of status and social acceptance appears to be more important than the risk involved with attendance. The descriptive model presented focuses on the categories of relationships and the risk associated with assimilating into the fraternity party culture.},

To investigate, we construct a dataset of scandals at the top 100 U.S. universities from 2001 to 2013. We find that scandals with significant media coverage substantially reduce applications. For example, a scandal covered in a long-form news article leads to a 10\% drop in applications the following year-roughly the same impact of dropping ten spots in prominent college rankings. This impact persists for 2 years. We find no impact on incoming student body competitiveness, yield, or alumni donations, and little effect on deterring future scandals. (JEL L82, I23, D83)},

Six fraternities were randomly assigned to a control or experimental group, and each of these fraternities hosted two parties. The three fraternities in the experimental group hosted a baseline party first and then hosted an intervention party at which those having a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level below 0.05 were entered in a \$100 cash lottery. The three fraternities in the control group hosted two control (non-intervention) parties. For the experimental fraternities, mean BAC levels were significantly lower at the intervention parties (M=0.079) than the baseline parties (M=0.098) and the percentage of partygoers with a BAC below 0.08 was significantly higher at intervention parties (40.1\%) than at baseline parties (30.6\%).

Participants: The authors' Campus Sexual Assault Study obtained self-report data from a random sample of undergraduate women (N = 5,446). Methods: The authors collected data on sexual assault victimization by using a cross-sectional, Web-based survey, and they conducted analyses assessing the role of substance use. The authors also compared victimizations before and during college, and across years of study. Results: Findings indicate that almost 20\% of undergraduate women experienced some type of completed sexual assault since entering college. Most sexual assaults occurred after women voluntarily consumed alcohol, whereas few occurred after women had been given a drug without their knowledge or consent. Conclusions: The authors discuss implications for campus sexual assault prevention programs, including the need for integrated substance use and sexual victimization prevention programming.},

	abstract = {Transformations that could be used to reduce the influence of extreme observations of dependent variables, which can assume either sign, on regression coefficient estimates are studied in this article. Two that seem reasonable on a priori grounds--the extended Box-Cox (BC) and the inverse hyperbolic sine (IHS)--are evaluated in detail. One feature is that the log-likelihood function for IHS is defined for zero values of the dependent variable, which is not true of BC. The double-length regression technique (Davidson and MacKinnon 1984) is used to perform hypothesis tests of one transformation against the other using Canadian data on household net worth. These tests support the use of IHS instead of BC for this data set. Empirical investigators in economics often work with a logged dependent variable (taking the natural logarithm of a data series is, of course, a special case of BC) to reduce the weight their particular estimation procedure might otherwise attach to extreme values of the dependent variable. Logging dependent and independent variables has the added attraction that slope coefficients may be interpreted as elasticities. In the event that the dependent variable assumes nonpositive values, some researchers (e.g., Diamond and Hausman 1984; King and Dicks-Mireaux 1982) have dropped the nonpositive values and others have added a constant so that each observation is positive. An alternative transformation, which is defined for any real number, is the IHS transformation, {\textless}tex-math{\textgreater}\${\textbackslash}operatorname\{sinh\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}(x) = {\textbackslash}log(x + (x{\textasciicircum}2 + 1){\textasciicircum}\{1/2\})\${\textless}/tex-math{\textgreater}. This was proposed in Johnson (1949) and is just as easy to employ as the BC transformation.},
