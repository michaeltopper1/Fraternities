## Main Results

Table \ref{main_results} reports that fraternity moratoriums lead to substantially lower alcohol offenses across university campuses while showing weaker evidence of decreases in both drug offenses and sexual assaults. Column (1) exhibits the naive regression with no controlsâ€”it compares only the difference in means between moratorium and non-moratorium days. While none of the panels contain significant results, this specification acts as a demonstration of the importance of accounting for the factors described in Section BLANK. On the other hand, Column (2) shows the baseline specification from Equation \ref{main_model}. This baseline specification includes day of the week, holiday, semester, and academic year fixed effects in order to address the potential concerns described earlier. Moreover, columns (3) and (4) show results from progressively adding more flexible fixed effects. In Panel A, alcohol offenses decrease during moratorium days relative to non-moratorium days in the academic calendar. In particular, an average moratorium day exhibits between 26 and 29% less alcohol offenses in comparison to an average academic calendar day. These estimates are statistically significant across each specification, maintaining that moratoriums decrease campus-wide alcohol offenses. While alcohol offenses are robust, both drug offenses and sexual assaults fail to achieve statistical significance across each specification and the magnitude of each effect varies considerably from a 3-17% reduction from the mean for drug offenses, and an 18-26% reduction for sexual assaults. One reason for this may be because including an interaction between university and academic year fixed effects changes the comparison groups; intuitively, a university by academic year fixed effect allows only for comparisons of moratorium days to non-moratoriums within a particular university's academic calendar. Similarly, interacting university, academic year, and semester fixed effects only allow for comparisons of moratorium days to non-moratorium days within a particular university's semester in a particular academic year. In light of these differences, all further analysis uses the controls from column (3) as the preferred specification due to their conservative estimates.
