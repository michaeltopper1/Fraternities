	abstract = {I estimate the impact of employment opportunities on recidivism among 1.7 million offenders released from a California prison between 1993 and 2008. The institutional structure of the California criminal justice system as well as location, skill, and industry‐specific job accession data provide a unique framework for identifying a causal effect of job availability on criminal behaviour. I find that increases in construction and manufacturing opportunities at the time of release are associated with significant reductions in recidivism. Other types of opportunities, including those characterised by lower wages that are typically accessible to individuals with criminal records, do not influence recidivism.},

	abstract = {This paper uses confidential Census data, specifically the 1990 and 2000 Census Long Form data, to study demographic processes in neighborhoods that gentrified during the 1990s. In contrast to previous studies, the analysis is conducted at the more refined census-tract level, with a narrower definition of gentrification and more closely matched comparison neighborhoods. Furthermore, our access to individual-level data with census tract identifiers allows us to separately identify recent in-migrants and long-term residents. Our results indicate that, on average, the demographic flows associated with the gentrification of urban neighborhoods during the 1990s are not consistent with displacement and harm to minority households. In fact, taken as a whole, our results suggest that gentrification of predominantly black neighborhoods creates neighborhoods that are attractive to middle-class black households.},

	abstract = {Social interactions within neighborhoods, schools and detention facilities are important determinants of criminal behavior. However, little is known about the degree to which neighborhood peers affect successful community re-entry following incarceration. This paper measures the influence of social networks on recidivism by exploiting the fact that neighborhood peers may be locked up when a prisoner returns home. Using detailed arrest and incarceration data that includes residential addresses for offenders, we find consistent and robust evidence that a former inmate is less likely to reoffend if more of his peers are held captive while he reintegrates into society.},

	abstract = {Gentriﬁcation has reshaped many of America’s largest cities in recent decades. While it has been linked to improvements in neighborhood consumption and environmental amenities, the extent to which these positive eﬀects spill into local public schools, a neighborhood amenity vital to the well-being of child residents, is an open empirical question. After matching Census tracts to attendance zones for public elementary schools in New York City, I use detailed school-, grade-, and tract-level data and a natural experiment that spurred gentriﬁcation in part of the city to estimate the causal eﬀects of gentriﬁcation on outcomes for neighborhood schools. Using an instrumental variables approach to address the endogeneity of gentriﬁcation, I ﬁnd that gentriﬁcation reduces math and English language arts test scores by 0.14 and 0.09 standard deviations on average, respectively. I ﬁnd no statistically signiﬁcant eﬀect of gentriﬁcation on class sizes, school expenditures per pupil, or student demographic characteristics. In contrast, most of the eﬀect on academic performance can be explained by 5\% increase in absence rates conditional on changes to school and student characteristics. Lastly, I provide evidence that decreased access to healthcare, measured by the number of healthcare facilities per capita, in gentrifying attendance zones is a possible mechanism for the increased absences.},
