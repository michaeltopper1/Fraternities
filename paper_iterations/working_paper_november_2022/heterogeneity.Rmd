# Heterogeneity \label{section:heterogeneity}

## Do Party Schools Exhibit the Strongest Effects? \label{section:party_schools}

Universities that have a reputation for partying may be more impacted by the restrictions of moratoriums than universities that party less. For example, past literature finds that party schools exhibit two times the increase in reports of rape on football game days than non-party schools [@lindo_college_2018]. To examine this possibility, I use Niche.com's Top Party Schools in America list.^[I use Niche.com over the Princeton Review since the Princeton Review no longer posts their party school rankings. For more details on the methodology see: https://www.niche.com/about/methodology/top-party-schools/.] The list assigns "party scene" scores based on criteria such as athletic department revenue, fraternity and sorority life statistics, access to bars, and student surveys. Using this list, a university is defined as a party school if it appears in the top 50 rankings. This amounts to 16 of the 37 universities in the sample being classified as a party school. 

As shown in Table \ref{party_school_table}, universities defined as party schools exhibit higher averages of alcohol offenses assaults relative to non-party schools. In particular, non-party schools experience approximately 49% less alcohol offenses on average. These differences are similar when excluding moratorium days (47%), although both party schools and non-party schools have relatively similar levels of sexual assaults.

Table \ref{party_school_table} also shows that party schools exhibit larger decreases in alcohol offenses than non-party schools during moratoriums. The point estimates in Panel A indicate that moratoriums decrease alcohol offenses on academic-calendar days by approximately 33% from the mean for party schools and 16% for non-party schools. Importantly, only the point estimates for party schools are statistically significant, thereby suggesting that the effects of the moratorium are driven by schools that have a stronger party culture. 

Similarly, Appendix \ref{asection:fraction} explores whether universities that have relatively more *fraternity* life—defined by the fraction of undergraduate students enrolled in an IFC—display larger effects. By supplementing the preferred specification with an interaction between the $InMoratorium_{u,t}$ treatment variable and the fraction of undergraduates in an IFC fraternity, there is evidence that universities with more fraternity life show larger declines in alcohol offenses during moratoriums. Although statistically insignificant, the point estimates are negative, thereby hinting at the possibility that moratoriums are more effective when a higher fraction of students are directly affected by its guidelines.

## Does the Triggering Event for a Moratorium Matter? \label{section:trigger}

As described in Section \ref{section:moratoriums}, moratoriums can be the result of a fraternity-related death, a prominent sexual assault, or a behavior violation. Given the differing salience of these events, it is possible that a triggering event affects a moratorium's effectiveness. As an illustration, a death may be more salient than a behavior violation, resulting in a behavior shock to the college campus. Moreover, both deaths and sexual assaults are exceptionally undesirable results of risky behavior—a moratorium may seem more justified under these outcomes rather than following an instance of hazing. 

Figure \ref{trigger_reg_graph} reports that moratoriums have a stronger impact when triggered by a death or sexual assault, rather than a behavior violation. Specifically, alcohol offenses decrease notably when a fraternity-related death is the trigger. To confirm that this effect is caused by the moratorium rather than the triggering death, I analyze data from 15 additional universities that had a fraternity-related death in the sample period, but did not have a moratorium.^[These universities were found using Hank Nuwer's repository of hazing-related deaths in the US: https://www.hanknuwer.com/hazing-deaths/.] Hence, these supplemental universities serve as a control group to observe the effect of a fraternity-related death without the influence of a moratorium. I exclusively analyze these 15 non-moratorium universities by creating a 64-day binary treatment variable (i.e., the average length of a moratorium) beginning with the date of the death. Next, I estimate the preferred specification using the 64-day period after the death in lieu of the $InMoratorium_{u,t}$ treatment variable. Panel C of Appendix Figures \ref{alc_forest} and \ref{sex_forest} show that there is little evidence of declines in alcohol offenses or sexual assaults following a fraternity-related death without a moratorium. The point estimates for alcohol offenses are consistently positive, while both offenses exhibit statistically insignificant estimates at the 10% level. To increase precision, I supplement this analysis in Panel D of Appendix Figures \ref{alc_forest} and \ref{sex_forest} by including the 14 never-treated schools that are used in Section 5.3 as never-treated controls. This amounts to 29 universities, 15 of which undergo the effect of a death, and 14 of which receive no such treatment. As shown, the point estimates remain consistent across both of these analyses and the statistical significance does not change. Taken together, there is little evidence suggesting that a fraternity-related death contributes to the decreases shown in alcohol and sexual assault offenses during a moratorium. Instead, this points to the possibility that students may more seriously abide by the moratorium guidelines when the triggering event is a death.


Additionally, Figure \ref{trigger_reg_graph} shows significant decreases in sexual assaults when a triggering event involves either a sexual assault or behavior violation. However, the persistent shortcomings of estimating effects on sexual assaults, such as the under-reporting issue, may be exacerbated in this analysis since these estimates are based on a small subset of universities (19 universities for behavior violations and 10 for sexual assaults).^[Survey evidence shows that nearly 80% of sexual assaults go unreported. This is based on statistics from the AAU Campus Climate Survey on Sexual Assault and Sexual Misconduct. See here: https://ira.virginia.edu/sites/ias.virginia.edu/files/University%20of%20Virginia_2015_climate_final_report.pdf] Consequently, although the results indicate evidence of decreases in sexual assaults, this evidence is mostly speculative under the data limitations.
