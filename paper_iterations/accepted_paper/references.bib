	abstract = {Recent statistics indicate that 25 percent of all female college students will experience some form of sexual assault by the time they graduate. Even that figure is probably an underestimate, since many women who are assaulted drop out of school. Very few of these incidents are reported, and when they are, campus authorities often mishandle the case, causing further trauma to the victim. Of the small number of cases pursued through campus judicial procedures or reported to the police, only a fraction result in conviction. Why does no one seem to know what to do about the problem of sexual assault on campus? Why do so few women report their assault? Why are so many cases mishandled? Why do some college administrators so fear being sued that their fear becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy? Why are some institutions better equipped to handle the problem, and what is the best way to handle sexual assault on campus? Carol Bohmer and Andrea Parrot, both recognized experts on the problem of rape, particularly acquaintance rape, examine these and other questions in this landmark book. Sexual Assault on Campus combines social science evidence, analysis of legal doctrine and cases, and interviews with victims, their parents, campus security officers, and college administrators. Based on the results of their own qualitative study on the responses to complaints of sexual assault on campus, the authors offer important new guidance to all involved in the problem, particularly administrators, lawyers, and service providers working with students - from rape crisis centers and social workers to residence hall directors. Further, Sexual Assault on Campus includes case studies, making it important readingfor students of social work, criminology, and law and society programs. And certainly victims of campus rape, their families, and friends will want to read this book - the first ever to deal effectively with the aftermath of sexual assault on campus.},

This study examines whether joining fraternities and sororities improves academic performance. In order to account for the self-selection bias of Greek membership, I exploit plausibly exogenous cross-class variation in Greek student composition at the course-instructor level. My estimate shows that a 10 percentage point increase in Greek student composition translates to a 0.02 standard deviation increase in course grade for Greek students relative to non-Greek students. I further find that this effect is driven largely by low-achieving and middle-achieving white Greek members.},

	abstract = {Limited research has examined sexual victimization among U.S. college men, and particularly fraternity men. We report the prevalence of sexual assault (SA) victimization among a sample of college fraternity members and the sociodemographic variables associated with this victimization. In April 2018, we conducted a web-based survey study among a random sample of fraternity members (n = 102) from a list of all fraternity members at a large Midwestern university. We used Fisher’s exact tests, Student’s t-tests, and log-binomial regression models to assess associations between sociodemographic variables and any SA victimization (attempted or completed penetrative sexual assault). Over a quarter (27.5\%) of respondents reported experiencing any SA victimization—penetrative sexual assault (13.7\%) or attempted penetrative sexual assault (25.5\%)—since entering college. Age, school year, and being on a varsity sports team were significantly associated with any SA victimization (p-values: {\textless}.01, {\textless}.01, and .02, respectively). Regression analyses showed older fraternity men had experienced significantly greater prevalence of any SA victimization compared to younger fraternity men (prevalence ratio [PR]: 2.78, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.35–5.73). Furthermore, any SA victimization was also more common among varsity sports team members (3\%) compared to nonmembers (0\%). These findings indicate that college men, particularly fraternity members, may experience sexual assault victimization at high rates. Our more inclusive survey language may have captured sexually violent experiences that traditional measures have not, such as “made to penetrate” experiences. We encourage the use of queries that are sensitive to the specific characteristics of male sexual violence victimization, including experiences of nonconsensual sexual activity where the victim is either the penetrated or the penetrator. Furthermore, prevention efforts and supportive services for survivors should be expanded to better address male SA victimization on college campuses.},

Alcohol-related behavior does not explain much of the effects of fraternity membership on either the human capital or social capital effects.

Methods: The survey included measures of attitudes towards sexual violence, knowledge of IPV resources, and participation in IPV prevention activities. Results: Fraternity members with unofficial houses were more accepting of sexual violence than nonmembers, whereas fraternity members with official houses were exposed to more IPV prevention messages than nonmembers. Conclusions: Results highlight the importance of considering fraternity house status as a risk factor for sexual violence. Unofficial houses that are not regulated by the university may be particularly problematic for IPV.},

Results: Public institutions with higher tuition, more liquor violations, and greater numbers of fraternity men and athletes were more likely to report rape on their campuses.

	volume = {69},
	doi = {10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2012.132},
	abstract = {Context Despite empirical links between sexual revictimization (ie, experiencing 2 or more sexual assaults) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), to our knowledge, no epidemiological studies document the prevalence of sexual revictimization and PTSD. Establishing estimates is essential to determine the scope, public health impact, and psychiatric sequelae of sexual revictimization.
Objective To estimate the prevalence of sexual revictimization and PTSD among 3 national female samples (adolescent, college, and adult household probability).
Design Surveys were used to collect data from the National Women's Study–Replication (2006; college) as well as household probability samples from the National Survey of Adolescents–Replication (2005) and the National Women's Study–Replication (2006; household probability).
Setting Households and college campuses across the United States.
Participants One thousand seven hundred sixty-three adolescent girls, 2000 college women, and 3001 household-residing adult women.
Main Outcome Measures Behaviorally specific questions assessed unwanted sexual acts occurring over the life span owing to the use of force, threat of force, or incapacitation via drug or alcohol use. Posttraumatic stress disorder was assessed with a module validated against the criterion standard Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV.
Results About 53\% of victimized adolescents, 50\% of victimized college women, and 58.8\% of victimized household-residing women reported sexual revictimization. Current PTSD was reported by 20\% of revictimized adolescents, 40\% of revictimized college women, and 27.2\% of revictimized household-residing women. Compared with nonvictims, odds of meeting past 6-month PTSD were 4.3 to 8.2 times higher for revictimized respondents and 2.4 to 3.5 times higher for single victims.
Conclusions Population prevalence estimates suggest that 769 000 adolescent girls, 625 000 college women, and 13.4 million women in US households reported sexual revictimization. Further, 154 000 sexually revictimized adolescents, 250 000 sexually revictimized college women, and 3.6 million sexually revictimized household women met criteria for past 6-month PTSD. Findings highlight the importance of screening for sexual revictimization and PTSD in pediatric, college, and primary care settings.},

When the population size of an aggregate unit is small relativeto the offense rate, crime rates must be computed from a small number ofoffenses. Such data are ill-suited to least-squares analysis. Poisson-basedregression models of counts of offenses are preferable because they arebuilt on assumptions about error distributions that are consistent withthe nature of event counts. A simple elaboration transforms the Poissonmodel of offense counts to a model of per capita offense rates.

Unlike classical statistical tests, these tests require specification of only the mean-variance relationship under the alternative, rather than the complete distribution whose choice is usually arbitrary. The optimal regression-based test is easily computed as the t-test from an auxiliary regression. If a distribution under the alternative hypothesis is in fact specified and is in the Katz system of distributions or is Cox's local approximation to the Poisson, the score test for the Poisson distribution is equivalent to the optimal regression-based test.},

Beginning with Poisson and compound Poisson models, which involve strong assumptions, a variety of possible stochastic models and their implications are discussed. A number of estimators and their properties are considered in the light of uncertainty about the data generation process. The paper also considers the role of tests in sequential revision of the model specification beginning with the Poisson case and provides a detailed application of the estimators and tests to a model of the number of doctor consultations.},

Methods: In 2016 we compared the rate of 2010–2013 youth (18–24 years) emergency department (ED) visits for injuries in Hospital Service Areas (HSA) with and without fraternities and sororities. ED visits were identified in the State Emergency Department Database (n=1,560 hospitals, 1,080 HSAs, 16 states). US Census Bureau and National Center for Education Statistics sources identified HSA population and campus (n=659) characteristics. A proprietary database identified campuses with fraternities and sororities (n=287). ED visits explicitly linked to fraternities and sororities in the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System–All Injury Program were used to identify injury causes for sub-group analysis. Results: HSAs serving campuses with fraternities and sororities had lower age 18–24 injury rates for all causes except firearm injuries (no difference). Conclusions: Fraternities and sororities were not associated with a higher injury rate at the population level among undergraduate-age youth. A major limitation is not being able to observe campus health services utilization.},

	abstract = {Background: Alcohol-related rape among university students is clearly a major concern. However, there have been no large-scale surveys of the prevalence of this offence among university students in the UK. The aim of the current paper is to investigate the prevalence and characteristics of alcohol-related rape among university students in seven universities in Wales.Methods: All universities in Wales were approached to take part in the research. Eight of the nine universities agreed to take part and seven universities emailed their students as planned. On the launch date, emails were sent by the universities to all students requesting that they take part in the survey. The email contained a link to a questionnaire covering a range of topics including: demographics, lifestyle factors, and substance misuse.Results: In total, 7,846 students submitted a questionnaire. Overall, just under six per cent of females reported being the victim of alcohol-related rape while at university compared with one per cent of males. Sexual orientation was significantly correlated with alcohol-related rape, with three per cent of heterosexuals reported being the victim of alcohol-related rape, compared with eight per cent of lesbians or gays. Students who drank alcohol frequently and those involved in binge drinking were also significantly more likely to report the offence.Conclusions: The government and universities should play a more direct role to ensure that actions are taken to deter, prevent, and treat the consequences of these largely unreported offences.},

Campus party culture has been shown to influence risk of other types of victimization, and there is reason to believe it may also influence drugging victimization. Using three behavioral indicators of participation in the campus party culture—binge drinking, Greek life membership, and first-year student status—this study estimates the main effect of each indicator, and their interaction, on undergraduates’ rates of drugging victimization. Estimating a generalized linear model using a large random sample (N = 6,931) from three universities, results show that each party culture variable and their three-way interaction significantly influenced students’ rate of drugging victimization. Sorority members who were first-year students and binge drank at least once in the past month had significantly higher rates of drugging victimization compared to all other groups of students.},

The current paper aimed to examine if barriers to disclosure may be more salient to sorority women. Participants: We examined differences in rates of hypothetical willingness to formally disclose (N = 693) and actual formal/informal disclosure (N = 584) as well as mental health as a function of Greek-life status among college women. Method: Two separate online surveys were administered (October, 2016; January, 2017), respectively. Results: Findings suggest no significant differences in rates of hypothetical or actual formal/informal disclosure as a function of Greek-life status; however, Greek-life members reported lower mental health. Conclusion: Findings from the current studies suggest that institutional factors (e.g., campus climate) may serve as a barrier to disclosure.

An analysis of the norms and dynamics of the social construction of fraternity brotherhood reveals the highly masculinist features of fraternity structure and process, including concern with a narrow, stereotypical conception of masculinity and heterosexuality; a preoccupation with loyalty, protection of the group, and secrecy; the use of alcohol as a weapon against women's sexual reluctance; the pervasiveness of violence and physical force; and an obsession with competition, superiority, and dominance. Interfraternity rivalry and competition-particularly over members, intramural sports, and women-encourage fraternity men's commodification of women. We conclude that fraternities will continue to violate women socially and sexually unless they change in fundamental ways.},

The present study applies identity theory to patterns of casual sex and dating at college, more predominantly known as hookup culture, to examine how the “partier” identity shapes drinking, partying, and hooking up. More specifically, we incorporate structural and perceptual control aspects of identity theory, expecting to find that commitment to, salience of, and endorsement of meanings associated with the “partier” identity will increase hookup likelihood. In doing so, we move beyond a public health discourse of hookup “risks” and frame this sexual behavior as a form of identity verification deeply embedded in social relationships and the self. We utilize two waves of data collected six months apart from 19- to 27-year-old college students at a large, southeastern public university (n = 197). Path analyses were conducted in which we control for characteristics typically associated with hookup culture, finding limited effects of demographic characteristics (e.g., race, drinking, and Greek life membership) on behavior. Instead, we largely find support for the proposed direct and indirect effects of identity theory’s concepts, collected at Wave 1, on hook up behaviors at Wave 2.},

Drawing from routine activity theory, low self-control, and social learning theory, this study tested a theoretical model that identified pertinent factors present among sorority environments to determine the relationships between Greek affiliation and sexual assault. Path analyses revealed that sorority women reported consuming more alcohol and with greater frequency, increased risk-taking behavior, delayed assessments of threat and responses to risk, and increased contact with fraternity men—all of which significantly predicted sexual assault. Future theory, research, and policy directions are proposed.},

While these social gatherings provide an opportunity for interaction and new relationships, the environment is often constructed in a manner that reinforces traditional gender roles and increases the overall risk of sexual assaults. For some females, the attainment of status and social acceptance appears to be more important than the risk involved with attendance. The descriptive model presented focuses on the categories of relationships and the risk associated with assimilating into the fraternity party culture.},

To investigate, we construct a dataset of scandals at the top 100 U.S. universities from 2001 to 2013. We find that scandals with significant media coverage substantially reduce applications. For example, a scandal covered in a long-form news article leads to a 10\% drop in applications the following year-roughly the same impact of dropping ten spots in prominent college rankings. This impact persists for 2 years. We find no impact on incoming student body competitiveness, yield, or alumni donations, and little effect on deterring future scandals. (JEL L82, I23, D83)},

Six fraternities were randomly assigned to a control or experimental group, and each of these fraternities hosted two parties. The three fraternities in the experimental group hosted a baseline party first and then hosted an intervention party at which those having a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level below 0.05 were entered in a \$100 cash lottery. The three fraternities in the control group hosted two control (non-intervention) parties. For the experimental fraternities, mean BAC levels were significantly lower at the intervention parties (M=0.079) than the baseline parties (M=0.098) and the percentage of partygoers with a BAC below 0.08 was significantly higher at intervention parties (40.1\%) than at baseline parties (30.6\%).

Participants: The authors' Campus Sexual Assault Study obtained self-report data from a random sample of undergraduate women (N = 5,446). Methods: The authors collected data on sexual assault victimization by using a cross-sectional, Web-based survey, and they conducted analyses assessing the role of substance use. The authors also compared victimizations before and during college, and across years of study. Results: Findings indicate that almost 20\% of undergraduate women experienced some type of completed sexual assault since entering college. Most sexual assaults occurred after women voluntarily consumed alcohol, whereas few occurred after women had been given a drug without their knowledge or consent. Conclusions: The authors discuss implications for campus sexual assault prevention programs, including the need for integrated substance use and sexual victimization prevention programming.},

	abstract = {Transformations that could be used to reduce the influence of extreme observations of dependent variables, which can assume either sign, on regression coefficient estimates are studied in this article. Two that seem reasonable on a priori grounds--the extended Box-Cox (BC) and the inverse hyperbolic sine (IHS)--are evaluated in detail. One feature is that the log-likelihood function for IHS is defined for zero values of the dependent variable, which is not true of BC. The double-length regression technique (Davidson and MacKinnon 1984) is used to perform hypothesis tests of one transformation against the other using Canadian data on household net worth. These tests support the use of IHS instead of BC for this data set. Empirical investigators in economics often work with a logged dependent variable (taking the natural logarithm of a data series is, of course, a special case of BC) to reduce the weight their particular estimation procedure might otherwise attach to extreme values of the dependent variable. Logging dependent and independent variables has the added attraction that slope coefficients may be interpreted as elasticities. In the event that the dependent variable assumes nonpositive values, some researchers (e.g., Diamond and Hausman 1984; King and Dicks-Mireaux 1982) have dropped the nonpositive values and others have added a constant so that each observation is positive. An alternative transformation, which is defined for any real number, is the IHS transformation, {\textless}tex-math{\textgreater}\${\textbackslash}operatorname\{sinh\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}(x) = {\textbackslash}log(x + (x{\textasciicircum}2 + 1){\textasciicircum}\{1/2\})\${\textless}/tex-math{\textgreater}. This was proposed in Johnson (1949) and is just as easy to employ as the BC transformation.},

Estimates are based on panel data from campus and local law enforcement agencies and an identification strategy that exploits plausibly random variation in the timing of Division 1 football games.

The effects are driven largely by 17–24-year-old offenders and by offenders unknown to the victim, but we also find significant effects on incidents involving offenders of other ages and on incidents involving offenders known to the victim.

There are good reasons to believe, however, that there may actually be a negative relationship between crime rates in a particular area due to temporal displacement. We exploit the correlation between weather and crime to examine the short-run dynamics of crime. Using variation in lagged crime rates due to weather shocks, we find that the positive serial correlation is reversed. These findings suggest that the long-run impact of temporary crime-prevention efforts may be smaller than the short-run effects.},

The effects are driven largely by 17–24-year-old offenders and by offenders unknown to the victim, but we also find significant effects on incidents involving offenders of other ages and on incidents involving offenders known to the victim.

However, recent advances in econometric theory show that such designs are likely to be biased in the presence of treatment effect heterogeneity. Given the pronounced use of staggered treatment designs in applied corporate finance and accounting research, this finding potentially impacts a large swath of prior findings in these fields. We survey the nascent literature and document how and when such bias arises from treatment effect heterogeneity. We apply recently proposed methods to a set of prior published results, and find that correcting for the bias induced by the staggered nature of policy adoption frequently impacts the estimated effect from standard difference-in-difference studies. In many cases, the reported effects in prior research become indistinguishable from zero.},

To assess this claim, we analyze the short-term mass closing of hundreds of medical marijuana dispensaries in Los Angeles. Contrary to popular wisdom, we find an immediate increase in crime around dispensaries ordered to close relative to those allowed to remain open. The increase is specific to the type of crime most plausibly deterred by bystanders, and is correlated with neighborhood walkability. We find a similar pattern of results for temporary restaurant closures due to health code violations. A likely common mechanism is that “eyes upon the street” deter some types of crime.},

The impact of legalization on traffic fatalities involving alcohol is larger and estimated with more precision than its impact on traffic fatalities that do not involve alcohol. Legalization is also associated with sharp decreases in the price of marijuana and alcohol consumption, which suggests that marijuana and alcohol are substitutes. Because alternative mechanisms cannot be ruled out, the negative relationship between legalization and alcohol-related traffic fatalities does not necessarily imply that driving under the influence of marijuana is safer than driving under the influence of alcohol.},

Binning identiﬁes dynamic treatment eﬀects in the absence of nevertreated units and is particularly suitable in case of multiple events. Second, event study designs with binned endpoints and distributed-lag models are numerically identical leading to the same parameter estimates after correct reparametrization. Third, classic dummy variable event study designs can be generalized to models that account for multiple events of diﬀerent sign and intensity of the treatment, which are common in public and labor economics. We demonstrate the practical relevance of our methodological points in an application studying the eﬀects of unemployment beneﬁt duration on job search eﬀort.},

Data are from a study of college life at a large midwestern university involving nine months of ethnographic observation of a women's floor in a “party dorm,” in-depth interviews with 42 of the floor residents, and 16 group interviews with other students. We show that sexual assault is a predictable outcome of a synergistic intersection of processes operating at individual, organizational, and interactional levels. Some processes are explicitly gendered, while others appear to be gender neutral. We discuss student homogeneity, expectations that partiers drink heavily and trust their party-mates, and residential arrangements. We explain how these factors intersect with more obviously gendered processes such as gender differences in sexual agendas, fraternity control of parties, and expectations that women be nice and defer to men. We show that partying produces fun as well as sexual assault, generating student resistance to criticizing the party scene or men's behavior in it. We conclude with implications for policy.},

While several studies have investigated the effect of youthful drinking on the quantity of human capital stock accumulated, measured by years of education completed or high-school graduation, this paper investigates the effect of alcohol consumption on the quality of human capital stock accumulated as measured by college students GPA. Using data from the Harvard School of Public Health's College Alcohol Study, the indirect effect of the quantity of alcohol consumed on GPA is estimated through hours spent studying as well as the direct effect. Results show that the net total effect of alcohol consumption on GPA is negative for the sample of college students, and that the main effect is via a reduction in the hours spent studying. This finding confirms that high levels of alcohol consumption have an overall negative consequence for academic achievement, and hence future labour market outcomes.},

We exploit a natural experiment in which students at a large state university were randomly assigned roommates through a lottery system. We find that on average, males assigned to roommates who reported drinking in the year prior to entering college had a Grade Point Average (GPA) one quarter-point lower than those assigned to nondrinking roommates. The effect of initial assignment to a drinking roommate persists into the second year of college and possibly grows. The effect is especially large for students who drank alcohol themselves in the year prior to college. In contrast to the males, females' GPAs do not appear affected by roommates' drinking prior to college. Furthermore, students' college GPA is not significantly affected by roommates' high school grades, admission test scores, or family background. These findings are more consistent with models in which peers change people's preferences than with models in which peers change people's choice sets. Surprisingly, the policy of segregating drinkers by having substance-free housing could potentially lower average GPA in the university.},

Although a link has been established between zero tolerance laws and lower motor vehicle fatalities, research has not produced strong evidence on how zero tolerance laws influence individual alcohol use and drinking and driving behaviors. Using a unique data set and a difference-in-difference-in-difference-type research design, we are able to analyze a number of pathways through which zero tolerance laws can work among an important underage population, college students. We find that zero tolerance laws reduce drinking and driving among college students. Further analysis of our detailed alcohol use measures suggests that zero tolerance laws are particularly effective at reducing the probability of driving after drinking for those who reported drinking away from home.

	abstract = {Purpose
To assess how social fraternity involvement (i.e., membership and residence) in college relates to substance use behaviors and substance use disorder symptoms during young adulthood and early midlife in a national sample.
Methods
National multi-cohort probability samples of US high school seniors from the Monitoring the Future study were assessed at baseline (age 18) and followed longitudinally via self-administered surveys across seven follow-up waves to age 35. The longitudinal sample consisted of 7,019 males and 8,661 females, of which 10\% of males and 10\% of females were active members of fraternities or sororities during college.
Results
Male fraternity members who lived in fraternity houses during college had the highest levels of binge drinking and marijuana use relative to non-members and non-students in young adulthood that continued through age 35, controlling for adolescent sociodemographic and other characteristics. At age 35, 45\% of the residential fraternity members reported alcohol use disorder (AUD) symptoms reflecting mild to severe AUDs; their adjusted odds of experiencing AUD symptoms at age 35 were higher than all other college and noncollege groups except non-residential fraternity members. Residential sorority members had higher odds of AUD symptoms at age 35 when compared with their noncollege female peers.
Conclusions
National longitudinal data confirm binge drinking and marijuana use are most prevalent among male fraternity residents relative to non-members and non-students. The increased risk of substance-related consequences associated with fraternity involvement was not developmentally limited to college and is associated with higher levels of long-term AUD symptoms during early midlife.},

Results: Compared to non-fraternity members, fraternity members experience an increase in sex without a condom for both oral sex (13.5\%, 95\% ci= 0.048, 0.221) and anal sex (28.5\%, 95\% ci= 0.174, 0.396). Compared to non-sorority members, sorority members are more likely to engage in oral sex without a condom. This result is not robust to single sorority members. Conclusions: Fraternity membership increases the probability of risky oral and anal sex. Policy Implications: The reduced use of condoms has implications on sexual health including an increased risk of contracting or spreading sexually transmitted infections.},

These databases receive widespread attention in the media and popular culture, but there has been no rigorous analysis of their impact on crime. This paper intends to fill that gap. I exploit the details and timing of state DNA database expansions in two ways, first to address the effects of DNA profiling on individuals' subsequent criminal behavior and then to address the aggregate effects on crime rates. I show that DNA databases deter crime by profiled offenders, reduce crime rates, and are more cost-effective than traditional law enforcement tools.},

	abstract = {AbstractSex offenders have become targets of some of the most far-reaching and novel crime legislation in the United States. Two key innovations have been registration and notification laws, which, respectively, require that offenders provide identifying information to law enforcement and mandate that this information be made fully public. We study how registration and notification affect the frequency and incidence across victims of reported sex offenses. We present evidence that registration reduces the frequency of reported sex offenses against local victims (for example, neighbors) by keeping police informed about local sex offenders. Notification also appears to reduce crime, not by disrupting the criminal conduct of convicted sex offenders, but by deterring nonregistered offenders. We find that notification may actually increase recidivism. This latter finding, consistent with the idea that notification imposes severe costs that offset the benefits to offenders of forgoing criminal activity, is significant, given that notification’s purpose is recidivism reduction.},

	abstract = {Objective: The current project aims to enhance our understanding of the well-established relation between fraternity membership and sexual aggression on college campuses. Most prior research has been cross-sectional and unable to distinguish selection and socialization accounts of the relation, and only one prior longitudinal study has simultaneously examined selection and socialization effects. Method: Fraternity membership, sexual aggression, binge drinking, sociosexual attitudes and behaviors, and perceived peer sexual aggression were assessed for 772 male participants (n = 116 fraternity members) in a longitudinal survey study from the summer prior to college through Year 2 of college. Results: Longitudinal path analyses revealed three key findings. First, fraternity membership was prospectively correlated with sexual aggression in Years 1 and 2 of college (socialization effect), controlling for selection effects, when the two prospective paths were constrained to be equivalent. Second, more frequent binge drinking and sociosexual attitudes prior to college prospectively correlated with an increased likelihood of joining a fraternity (selection effect), and both selection variables indirectly correlated with future sexual aggression via fraternity membership. Third, fraternity membership was associated with increased binge drinking and perceived peer sexual aggression (socialization effects). Conclusions: These findings identify critical targets for the prevention of sexually aggressive behavior that are linked to fraternity membership: Binge drinking and sociosexual attitudes.

We find that the presence of a merit-aid program in one's state generally leads to an overall increase in (heavy) drinking. This effect is concentrated among men, students with lower parental education, older students, and students with high college GPA's. Our findings are robust to several alternative empirical specifications including event-study analyses by year of program adoption. Furthermore, no difference in high-school drinking is observed for students attending college in states with merit-aid programs.},

Identification comes from an exceptional policy introduced in the city of Maastricht in the Netherlands that discriminated access via licensed cannabis shops based on an individual’s nationality. We apply a difference-in-difference approach using administrative panel data on course grades of local students enrolled at Maastricht University before and during the partial cannabis prohibition. We find that the academic performance of students who are no longer legally permitted to buy cannabis substantially increases. Grade improvements are driven by younger students and the effects are stronger for women and low performers. In line with how cannabis consumption affects cognitive functioning, we find that performance gains are larger for courses that require more numerical/mathematical skills. Our investigation of underlying channels using course evaluations suggests that performance gains are driven by an improved understanding of the material rather than changes in students’ study effort.},

Data are from a nationally representative survey of students in U.S. colleges and universities. Separate estimates are obtained for underage male and female students, as well as for older male and female students. The estimates indicate that the drinking practices of male college students are generally insensitive to the price of beer. However, underage drinking and binge drinking by female students do respond significantly to price, although both are relatively inelastic. The results also show that strong drunk driving policies targeting youths and young adults significantly reduce drinking and binge drinking by male students. Similarly, these policies reduce drinking among female college students but appear to have little impact on their binge drinking. Instead, the results indicate that many elements of campus life (including participation in a fraternity or sorority, living on campus, and the ready availability of alcoholic beverages) are among the most important determinants of drinking and binge drinking among college students.},

Results indicated that students were significantly more intoxicated at fraternity parties (mean BAC = .093) than at private parties (mean BAC = .082), and men (mean BAC = .093) were significantly more intoxicated than women (mean BAC = .080). These results support the common belief that parties hosted by fraternity groups set the occasion for the highest levels of intoxication found on college campuses.

	abstract = {Using a panel of state-level data over the years 1982–2000, this study explores the potential relationship between alcohol policy, alcohol consumption, and rape by considering a number of theoretical and methodological issues. First, the potential relationship is examined in the context of an economics-of-crime model, controlling for various deterrence and opportunity cost variables. Second, unlike most studies, consumption of liquor and wine are considered as well as consumption of beer. A third focus is on the potential endogeneity of alcohol consumption. A fourth consideration dictates the focus on rape-rates rather than other violent crime rates. Several studies have discovered a tendency for relatively high alcohol consumption by both offenders and victims. Since rape victims are virtually all female, and at least some alcohol policy variables appear to have differential impacts on females and heavy-drinking males, an examination of policy impacts for rape-rates, unlike other types of violent crime, can suggest the nature of the alcohol-consumption–violence relationship. The empirical results support an “alcohol-increases-potential-victims-vulnerability” hypothesis. In the context of the economic theory of crime, this lowers the expected cost of rape to potential offenders and raises rape-rates. Tests for endogeneity of alcohol consumption and resulting simultaneous equation estimates reinforce this implication because they suggest that potential victims respond to relatively high rape-rates by reducing alcohol consumption.},

Using a unique dataset, which combines data from three sources, we find that a larger percentage of students in fraternities (but not sororities) is associated with an increase in the number of arrests for drug law violations. A larger percentage of students in sororities (but not the percentage of students in fraternities) is associated with a larger number of arrests for liquor law violations.

We focus on the staggered adoption setting where units, e.g, individuals, firms, or states, adopt the policy or treatment of interest at a particular point in time, and then remain exposed to this treatment at all times afterwards. We take a design perspective where we investigate the properties of estimators and procedures given assumptions on the assignment process. We show that under random assignment of the adoption date the standard Difference-In-Differences (DID) estimator is an unbiased estimator of a particular weighted average causal effect. We characterize the exact finite sample properties of this estimand, and show that the standard variance estimator is conservative.},

The first term is a weighted sum of the effect of that treatment in each group and period, with weights that may be negative and sum to one. The second term is a sum of the effects of the other treatments, with weights summing to zero. Accordingly, coefficients in those regressions are not robust to heterogeneous effects, and may be contaminated by the effect of other treatments. We propose alternative estimators that are robust to heterogeneous effects, and that do not suffer from the contamination problem.},

A causal interpretation of two-way fixed effects DD estimates requires both a parallel trends assumption and treatment effects that are constant over time.

The usual solution is to calculate cluster-robust standard errors that permit heteroskedasticity and within-cluster error correlation, but presume that the number of clusters is large. Standard asymptotic tests can over-reject, however, with few (five to thirty) clusters. We investigate inference using cluster bootstrap-t procedures that provide asymptotic refinement. These procedures are evaluated using Monte Carlos, including the example of Bertrand, Duflo, and Mullainathan (2004). Rejection rates of 10\% using standard methods can be reduced to the nominal size of 5\% using our methods.},

We characterize the asymptotic behavior of the estimator, propose tools for inference, and develop tests for identifying assumptions. Extensions include time-varying controls, triple-differences, and certain non-binary treatments. We show the practical relevance of these insights in a simulation study and an application. Studying the consumption response to tax rebates in the United States, we find that the notional marginal propensity to consume is between 8 and 11 percent in the first quarter -- about half as large as benchmark estimates used to calibrate macroeconomic models -- and predominantly occurs in the first month after the rebate.},

To illustrate the severity of this issue, we randomly generate placebo laws in state-level data on female wages from the Current Population Survey. For each law, we use OLS to compute the DD estimate of its “effect” as well as the standard error of this estimate. These conventional DD standard errors severely understate the standard deviation of the estimators: we find an “effect” significant at the 5 percent level for up to 45 percent of the placebo interventions. We use Monte Carlo simulations to investigate how well existing methods help solve this problem. Econometric corrections that place a specific parametric form on the time-series process do not perform well. Bootstrap (taking into account the autocorrelation of the data) works well when the number of states is large enough. Two corrections based on asymptotic approximation of the variance-covariance matrix work well for moderate numbers of states and one correction that collapses the time series information into a “pre”- and “post”-period and explicitly takes into account the effective sample size works well even for small numbers of states.},

We show that a family of causal effect parameters are identified in staggered DiD setups, even if differences in observed characteristics create non-parallel outcome dynamics between groups. Our identification results allow one to use outcome regression, inverse probability weighting, or doubly-robust estimands. We also propose different aggregation schemes that can be used to highlight treatment effect heterogeneity across different dimensions as well as to summarize the overall effect of participating in the treatment. We establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators and prove the validity of a computationally convenient bootstrap procedure to conduct asymptotically valid simultaneous (instead of pointwise) inference. Finally, we illustrate the relevance of our proposed tools by analyzing the effect of the minimum wage on teen employment from 2001–2007.

A meta-analysis found 58.94\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] [52.35\%, 65.53\%]) of students (12 studies) and 68.39\% (95\% CI [65.12\%, 71.67\%]) of faculty (7 studies) supported smoke-free policies. Both studies measuring student smoking prevalence indicated a postban reduction (16.5\% to 12.8\% after 1 year [p {\textless} .001] and 9.5\% to 7.0\% [p = .036] after 3 years). Only 5\% of UK universities were smoke-free compared with 25\% of US universities. Conclusions: A majority of students and faculty support smoke-free campus policies, which may reduce smoking and SHS exposure.},

	abstract = {Background
The hazardous effects of alcohol consumption on both the hippocampus and memory have been well established. However, the longitudinal effects of ethanol on the developing brain and related consequences on memory are not well explored. Given the above, we investigated the longitudinal effects of college drinking on hippocampal volume in emerging college adults.
Methods
Data were derived from the longitudinal Brain and Alcohol Research with College Students study. A subset of 146 freshmen (mean age at baseline = 18.5 years) underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging scans at baseline and 24 months later. Four drinking-related measures derived from monthly surveys were reduced to a single alcohol use index using principal component analysis. Gray matter volumetric change (GMV-c) data were derived using a longitudinal pipeline. Voxelwise hippocampal/para-hippocampal GMV-c associations with the drinking index were derived using a multiple regression framework within SPM12. Supplementary associations were assessed between GMV-c and memory scores computed from the California Verbal Learning Test–II (assessed at the end of the study), and between GMV-c and total alcohol-induced memory blackouts.
Results
Larger alcohol use index was associated with an accelerated GMV decline in the hippocampus/para-hippocampus. Also, larger hippocampal volume decline was associated with poorer memory performance and more memory blackouts.
Conclusions
Our study extends prior cross-sectional literature by showing that a heavier drinking burden while in college is associated with greater hippocampal GMV decline that is in turn associated with poorer memory scores, all of which could ultimately have a significant impact on student success.},

	abstract = {Alcohol use typically is initiated during adolescence, a period that coincides with critical structural and functional maturation of the brain. Brain maturation and associated improvements in decision making continue into the third decade of life, reaching a plateau within the period referred to as emerging adulthood (18–24 years). This particular period covers that of traditionally aged college students, and includes the age (21 years) when alcohol consumption becomes legal in the United States. This review highlights neurobiological evidence indicating the vulnerabilities of the emerging-adult brain to the effects of alcohol. Factors increasing the risks associated with underage alcohol use include the age group's reduced sensitivity to alcohol sedation and increased sensitivity to alcohol-related disruptions in memory. On the individual level, factors increasing those risks are a positive family history of alcoholism, which has a demonstrated effect on brain structure and function, and emerging comorbid psychiatric conditions. These vulnerabilities—of the age group, in general, as well as of particular individuals—likely contribute to excessive and unsupervised drinking in college students. Discouraging alcohol consumption until neurobiological adulthood is reached is important for minimizing alcohol-related disruptions in brain development and decision-making capacity, and for reducing the negative behavioral consequences associated with underage alcohol use.},

	abstract = {Objective: This study examines attendance and alcohol use at parties and bars among college students by gender, residence, year in school and legal drinking age. Method: The study participants were respondents in the 1997 and 1999 Harvard School of Public Health College Alcohol Study (CAS). The combined sample consisted of 12,830 students (61\% women) who reported use of alcohol in the past 30 days prior to interview. Their responses provided information on attendance and alcohol use at parties (dormitory, fraternity, off campus) and off-campus bars. Logistic regression analyses examined the influence of gender, residence, year in school and legal drinking age related to attendance, drinking/non-drinking and heavy drinking (5 or more drinks) at each select setting. Results: Consistent with the literature, fraternity/ sorority parties were occasions of heavy drinking (49\%) among drinkers in those settings, yet they drew upon smaller proportions of students (36\%) when compared to off-campus parties (75\%) and off-campus bars (68\%). Off-campus parties (45\%) and bars (37\%) were also occasions for heavy drinking among drinkers in these settings. College residence was shown to relate to differential exposure to drinking settings, but residence had less impact on the decision to drink and the level of heavy drinking. Attendance at parties decreased with advance in school years, but attendance at off-campus bars increased. Although heavy drinking at off-campus bars decreased with advancing grade year in school, slightly higher proportions of under-age students (41\%) compared to students of legal drinking age (35\%) exhibited heavy drinking at off-campus bars. Conclusions: The identification of high-risk settings and their correlates serves to better understand the development of heavy drinking on college campuses. Off-campus parties, as compared to campus parties and bars, may pose greater difficulties related to successful intervention.},

These organizations, especially fraternities, have a reputation for encouraging unruly and improper behaviour among both members and non-members. This paper investigates the effect of the degree of prevalence of these Greek organizations at a campus, as measured by the percentage of students who are members of fraternities and sororities, on the instances of liquor and drug law violations on campuses, as measured by the number of arrests for liquor and drug laws violations. Using a unique dataset, which combines data from three sources, we address any potential selection bias by including several controls associated with party culture and through the inclusion of institution-level fixed effects. We find that a larger percentage of students in fraternities (but not sororities) is associated with an increase in the number of arrests for drug law violations. A larger percentage of students in sororities (but not the percentage of students in fraternities) is associated with a larger number of arrests for liquor law violations. This result is highly significant and is robust across various specifications.},

Binning identifies dynamic treatment effects in the absence of never-treated units and is particularly suitable in case of multiple events. Second, event study designs with binned endpoints and distributed-lag models are numerically identical leading to the same parameter estimates after correct reparametrization. Third, classic dummy variable event study designs can be generalized to models that account for multiple treatments of different signs and varying intensities, which are common in public and labor economics. We demonstrate the practical relevance of our methodological points in an application studying the effects of unemployment benefit duration on job search effort.},
