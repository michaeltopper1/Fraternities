\caption{An Example of a Daily Crime Log \label{crime_log}}
\textit{Note:} The main analysis uses data from 37 universities' Daily Crime Logsâ€”each unique in their own respect. All Daily Crime Logs are collected from each university and harmonized using the pattern matching technique outlined in Section 3.B.

\caption{Greek-life Rankings of Universities Included in the Sample \label{niche_ranking_graph}}
\textit{Note:} Greek-life rankings are based on Niche.com's 2023 list of Colleges with the Best Greek Life. Rankings are based on survey responses from Niche.com users on the quality of Greek Life at their school. The dashed red line represents the median ranking of the 37 universities in the sample. Three-hundred universities are ranked in the list. Of the universities in the sample, 14 of the 37 universities (38\%) are ranked in the top 50, while only 5 of 37 (13\%) are not ranked.

\caption{Event Study for Alcohol Offenses \label{es_alc_46_g}}
\textit{Note:} The shaded area point estimate represents an entire moratorium period for each university. Hence, the shaded area point estimate has varying amounts of days within based on the university. For instance, Arkansas State University had a 39 day moratorium and therefore their shaded area point estimate would be identified by the 39 moratorium days. Point estimates not within the shaded region are 46 day periods. Number of days within a period was chosen to give approximately two median-length (46 days) moratorium on each side of the shaded area. All periods are normalized by the 46-day period before the moratorium. Alcohol offenses are defined as alcohol offenses per-25000 enrolled students. Controls include holiday, spring semester, day of the week, football game-days, and university by academic year. Standard errors clustered by university. All errorbars represent 95\% confidence intervals.

Number of days within a period was chosen to give approximately two median-length (46 days) moratorium on each side of the shaded area. All periods are normalized by the 46-day period before the moratorium. Sexual assault offenses are defined as sexual assault offenses per-25000 enrolled students. Controls include holiday, spring semester, day of the week, football game-days, and university by academic year. Standard errors clustered by university. All errorbars represent 95\% confidence intervals.

Offenses are per-25000 enrolled students. Errorbars represent 95\% confidence intervals. Weekends includes only Friday, Saturday, Sunday, while weekdays includes Monday through Thursday.

\caption{Robustness Across Samples (Alcohol Offenses) \label{alc_forest}}
\textit{Note:} This graph depicts the coefficient estimates and 95\% confidence intervals for different subsets of the sample. The y-axis on the left is the sample selection used, while the y-axis on the right is the point estimate. All estimates use the preferred specification from Table 4 Column 2, and all outcomes are in terms of per-25000 enrolled students. Standard errors are clustered at the university level. Panel A uses the main sample as shown in the main results, while Panel B uses the main sample in addition to 14 never-treated schools (see Section 5.A for more details). Panel C analyzes 15 universities which undergo a fraternity death, but do not undergo a moratorium. A 64-day binary treatment period is given to each of these universities, beginning on the date of the death. Panel D extends the analysis in Panel C by adding in the 15 never-treated universities as controls, analogous to Panel B in reference to Panel A. See Section 6.B for more details.

\caption{The Effect of Football Game-day Weekends With/Without Moratoriums \label{game_weekend_plot}}
\textit{Note:} Game weekends include all football games occurring in the sample period. 34 of the 37 universities have football teams and corresponding game days. The y-axis represents coefficient estimates. Errorbars represent 95\% confidence intervals. Each panel is split into two effects: the first effect being the effect of only football game-day weekends on the outcome per-25000 enrolled students, and the second being the effect of a football game-day weekend that occurs within a moratorium. A game-day weekend is defined as a weekend in which a football game occurs. For example, if a game occurs on a Friday, then Saturday and Sunday will be included in the game weekend. Note that weekends are defined as Friday/Saturday/Sunday. "All Game Weekends" includes both home and away games. The effects of game-day weekends + moratorium is identified by 245 football game days that coincide with moratoriums. Controls include holiday, spring semester, day of the week, and university by academic year. Standard errors are clustered by university.
