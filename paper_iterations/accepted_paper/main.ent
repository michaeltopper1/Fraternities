macro:->A
chapter,
otherwise
known
as
a
\emph

is
a
unique
fraternity.
A

many

usually
one
per-school.

macro:->This
is
the
minimum
requirement
for

in

ban
alcohol
at
social
events
for
all
IFC
fraternities
in
addition
to
the
rest
of
their
Fraternity

the
distinction
between

days.
A

\@endanenote 
\@doanenote {6}
macro:->Note
that
the
fraternity's
chapter
headquarters
cannot
impose
a

Since
chapter
headquarters
are

they
only
have
jurisdiction
over
one
specific
fraternity.

\@doanenote {8}
macro:->There
is
one
exception
to
this
which
is
the
first
moratorium
at
San
Diego
State
University.
While
the
start
date
has
been
verified
by
a
newspaper
article,
the
exact
end
date
is
ambiguous.
However,
evidence
shows
that
the
moratorium
ended
before
the
start
of
the
2015
spring
semester,
and
hence,
this
is
the
date
used
in
the
analysis.

it
