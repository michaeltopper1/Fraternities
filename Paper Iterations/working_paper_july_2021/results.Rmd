# Results

## Main Results and Robustness

In Table \ref{tab:main_results}, I estimate Equation \ref{main_model} with OLS using both reports of sexual assault and alcohol offenses per 25 thousand enrolled students as the dependent variables. Standard errors are clustered at the university level, and university-by-semester and weekday fixed effects are included in all specifications. Columns (1)-(3) represent the effect of fraternity moratoriums  on alcohol offenses. Column (1) shows a large and statistically significant decrease in alcohol offenses when there are no restrictions on days of the week  (e.g. including Monday-Sunday), representing a `r round(.141/.556,2)*100`% reduction from the mean. These effects appear to be driven by weekend days (Friday/Saturday/Sunday), as shown in column (2),while there is no evidence of significant decreases in alcohol offenses during weekdays in column (3). This is consistent with the outcome means (row 3) showing that drinking behavior is less common on weekdays, and alcohol related offenses tend to occur most frequently on the weekends. On the other hand, column (4) shows that reports of sexual assault decrease by a small and statistically insignificant magnitude during moratorium days within the whole sample (Monday-Sunday). While this effect remains small on weekdays (column (6)), there appears to be evidence of large `r round(.017/.054,2) *100`% reduction from the mean on weekends.

In Table (Appendix?) \ref{tab:poisson_results}, I replicate the results shown in Table \ref{tab:main_results} using poisson estimation given the discrete, non-negative count nature of the offenses. Hence, $\beta$ can be interpreted as the percent change in the outcome of interest due to moratoriums after a slight transformation.^[For a 'percentage change' interpretation, I use the $e^\beta-1$ transformation.] The estimation exhibits similar results: alcohol offenses decline substantially during moratoriums while sexual assaults remain unchanged at conventional levels of significance. The coefficients show a 28% decrease in alcohol offenses (column (1)), with this effect being attributed to large decreases on the weekends (column (2)). Similarly to OLS, there is little evidence of reductions in reports of sexual assault when considering all weekdays (column (4)), but weakly significant of reductions (32%) on the weekends (column (5)).^[Despite slightly larger magnitudes, I prefer OLS estimation since it (1) provides more conservative estimates and (2) poisson regression with fixed effects may drop observations when no variation is observed.]

While the effects are robust across different estimators I empirically test that the results are not being driven by one specific university. For instance, it is conceivable that the large decreases observed in alcohol offenses are the consequence of one university that had particularly large effects or experienced an unusually long moratorium period. To mitigate this plausible issue, I estimate Equation \ref{main_model} using a leave-one-out regression framework. More specifically, I estimate `r number_of_universities` separate regressions, with each estimation omitting one university and plot the distribution of estimated $\beta$ coefficients and standard errors in Figure \ref{loo}. In each iteration, the results remain similar across both alcohol offenses and sexual assault. There appears to be no deviation in statistical significance and little deviation in the magnitude of the effects when omitting a single university.

Furthermore, as a placebo test, I test whether robberies and burglaries, two outcomes that have not been documented to be associated with fraternity behavior, are affected by fraternity moratoriums. I combine robberies and burglaries into a single explanatory variable, and estimate Equation \ref{main_model} in Table \ref{tab:robbery}. As expected, there are no effects across robberies.

## Heterogeneity

### Which triggering events have the biggest effects?

Table \ref{tab:hetero_trigger_alc} examines the effect of fraternity moratorium on alcohol offenses by triggering event. As shown in Figure \ref{trigger_plot}, moratoriums can be triggered by either behavior violations (hazing, racist activity), a sexual assault, or a fraternity related death. If a moratorium was implemented for an unknown reason, I categorize these as unknown. Column (1) shows the effect of moratoriums that were caused by a sexual assault on alcohol offenses. The effect size is small and statistically insignificant from zero. In contrast, a moratorium triggered by a fraternity-related death (column (2)), exhibits a strong, statistically significant `r round(.247/.556,2)*100`% reduction from the mean. This is larger than any effect shown in Table \ref{tab:hetero_trigger_alc} or the main results in Table \ref{tab:main_results}, suggesting that particularly salient events (such as a fraternity death) have a particularly strong impact on student behavior, whereas less salient events (such as a behavior violation (column (3)) or sexual assault (column (1))) have little impact. Interestingly, when a triggering event is unknown, there is weak evidence of decreases in alcohol offenses (column (4)). I leave this interpretation to the reader as only speculation can be applied.

I further examine the heterogeneous effects by triggering event in Table \ref{tab:hetero_trigger_sex}, where sexual assault is the outcome of interest. Column (1) exhibits the effect of a moratorium triggered by a sexual assault on reports of sexual assault where there is a large, statistically significant reduction from the mean of `r round(0.045/.06,2)*100`%. All other triggering events--death of a student (column (2)), behavior violation (column (3)), and unknown (column(4))--show statistical zeros. 


### Which disciplinary figure is best?

To explore heterogeneity further, I test whether there are differences in the effects of moratorium on offenses between university-enacted  and IFC council-enacted moratoriums. There are distinct differences between the two sources of oversight; a university-enacted moratorium is imposed by the overseeing university and IFC council-enacted moratoriums are imposed by the IFC council, a group of undergraduate students within the fraternity community that represent fraternity chapters and oversee fraternity activity. Hence, an IFC council-enacted moratorium can be labeled as a student-led action. 

A university-enacted moratorium generally contains clear guidelines that fraternities must abide by or risk further disciplinary action. On the other hand, it is uncertain what consequences are ascertained when a fraternity breaks the guidelines given by an IFC council. Table \ref{tab:hetero_uni_ifc} shows the estimated effects of both university-enacted and IFC council-enacted moratorium on alcohol offenses and reports of sexual assault. In columns (1) and (2), alcohol offenses significant decrease in both the full sample (Monday-Sunday) and when restricting to weekends when the university enacts the moratorium. Conversely, there is little statistical evidence that IFC enacted moratoriums have a significant impact on alcohol offenses, with weakly significant decreases appearing on the weekends. Columns (3)-(6) show the effects on reports sexual assault. In each column, reports of sexual assault remain statistical zeros.
