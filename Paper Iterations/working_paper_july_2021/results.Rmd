## Main Results and Robustness

In Table \ref{main_estimation}, I estimate Equation \ref{main_model} with OLS using both reports of sexual assault and alcohol offenses per 25 thousand enrolled students as the dependent variables. Standard errors are clustered at the university level, and university-by-semester and weekday fixed effects are included in all specifications. Columns (1)-(3) represent the effect of fraternity moratoriums  on alcohol offenses. Column (1) shows a large and statistically significant decrease in alcohol offenses when there are no restrictions on days of the week  (e.g. including Monday-Sunday), representing a `r round(.141/.556,2)*100`% reduction from the mean. These effects appear to be driven by weekend days (Friday/Saturday/Sunday), as shown in column (2),while there is no evidence of significant decreases in alcohol offenses during weekdays in column (3). This is consistent with current literature showing that drinking behavior is less common on weekdays (CITE), and alcohol related offenses tend to occur most frequently on the weekends (CITE). On the other hand, column (4) shows that reports of sexual assault decrease by a small and statistically insignificant magnitude during moratorium days within the whole sample (Monday-Sunday). While this effect remains small on weekdays (column (6)), there appears to be evidence of large `r round(.017/.054,2) *100`% reduction from the mean on weekends.

In Table (Appendix?) \ref{poisson_estimation}, I replicate the results shown in Table \ref{main_estimation} using poisson estimation given the discrete, non-negative count nature of the offenses. Hence, $\beta$ can be interpreted as the percent change in the outcome of interest due to moratoriums after a slight transformation.^[For a 'percentage change' interpretation, I use the $e^\beta-1$ transformation.] The estimation exhibits similar results: alcohol offenses decline substantially during moratoriums while sexual assaults remain unchanged at conventional levels of significance. The coefficients show a 28% decrease in alcohol offenses (column (1)), with this effect being attributed to large decreases on the weekends (column (2)). Similarly to OLS, there is little evidence of reductions in reports of sexual assault when considering all weekdays (column (4)), but weakly significant of reductions (32%) on the weekends (column (5)).^[Despite slightly larger magnitudes, I prefer OLS estimation since it (1) provides more conservative estimates and (2) poisson regression with fixed effects may drop observations when no variation is observed.]

While the effects are robust across different estimators I empirically test that the results are not being driven by one specific university. For instance, it is conceivable that the large decreases observed in alcohol offenses are the consequence of one university that had particularly large effects or experienced an unusually long moratorium period. To mitigate this plausible issue, I estimate Equation \ref{main_model} using a leave-one-out regression framework. More specifically, I estimate `r number_of_universities` separate regressions, with each estimation omitting one university and plot the distribution of estimated $\beta$ coefficients and standard errors in Figure \ref{leave_one_out}. In each iteration, the results remain similar across both alcohol offenses and sexual assault. There appears to be no deviation in statistical significance and little deviation in the magnitude of the effects when omitting a single university.

Furthermore, as a placebo test, I test whether robberies and burglaries, two outcomes that have not been documented to be associated with fraternity behavior, are affected by fraternity moratoriums. I combine robberies and burglaries into a single explanatory variable, and estimate Equation \ref{main_model} in Table \ref{robbery}. As expected, there are no effects across robberies.
