	abstract = {Objectives  Prison facility security classification is intended to recognize differences across inmates with regard to the propensity to commit misconduct and to appropriately house inmates with varying levels of violent and/or antisocial behavior while they are incarcerated. The intent of security classification is to increase safety for staff and other inmates, but little is known about the effect of security classification on prison misconduct.
Methods  Using administrative records of roughly 60,000 inmates in the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR), this study attempts to identify the relationship between security classification and rules violation reports using a regression discontinuity design.
Results Results indicate that inmates placed in Level II (medium security) prisons are approximately 11 percentage points more likely to be written up than inmates placed in Level III (close security) prisons, and that the difference is driven almost entirely by a higher likelihood of write ups for the lowest level offenses like bartering and gambling. In contrast to prior work, this study does not detect an effect of Level IV (maximum security) prisons on rules violation reports.
Conclusions  The fuzzy regression discontinuity design allows for a rigorous way to estimate the causal effect of facility security classification on rules violation reports in California prisons, providing an evidence base for policy-makers facing capacity constraints within the prison system while at the same time updating the extant literature on the effects of an important feature of prison structure on inmate outcomes.},

	abstract = {The “get-tough” era of punishment led to exponential growth in the rate of incarceration in the United States. Recent reviews of the literature indicate, however, that limited rigorous research exists examining the effect of imprisonment on the likelihood of future offending. As a result, scholars have called for assessment of this relationship, while using methodologies that can better account for selection effects. This study addresses these calls directly by applying regression discontinuity, a methodology well suited to account for selection bias, on a cohort of felony offenders in Florida. Results suggest that prison, as compared to non-incarcerative sanctions, has no appreciable impact on recidivism. Although no differential effects surfaced across race/ethnicity, the analyses indicated that imprisonment exerts a differential effect by gender with the effect being more criminogenic among males than females.},

	abstract = {This short-term prospective study examined general and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT)-specific risk and protective factors for suicide attempts in an ethnically diverse sample of LGBT youth (N = 237, 47.7 \% male). A structured psychiatric interview assessed clinical depression and conduct disorder symptoms, as well as past and prospective suicide attempts over a 1-year follow-up period (91 \% retention). Participants completed questionnaires measuring general risk factors for suicide attempts, including hopelessness, impulsiveness, and perceived social support. They also completed measures of LGBT-specific suicide risk factors, including gender nonconformity, age of first same-sex attraction, and LGBT victimization. Correlation and multivariate regression analyses were conducted to examine the relations between predictors and suicide attempt, and to identify mediators. Of nine variables examined, seven were related to lifetime history of attempted suicide: hopelessness, depression symptoms, conduct disorder symptoms, impulsivity, victimization, age of first same-sex attraction, and low family support. Depressive symptoms and hopelessness mediated the relation between multiple risk and resilience factors and suicide attempts. Suicide attempt history was the strongest predictor of prospective suicide attempts. Participants who previously attempted suicide (31.6 \% of the sample) had more than 10 times greater odds of making another attempt in the 1-year follow-up period than were those who had made no previous attempt. These results highlight the need for suicide prevention programs for LGBT youth and suggest the importance of addressing depression and hopelessness as proximal determinants and family support and victimization, which have more distal effects.},

This expanded model predicts that suicide attempts are more likely when future income may be positively affected by the attempt, conditional on survival. Data from the National Comorbidity Survey show that ex post, individuals who made a suicide attempt had higher incomes than peers who seriously considered suicide but who never made a suicide attempt. Moreover, those who reported making the most serious attempts experienced the largest subsequent effects on income.},

Our results are consistent with unemployment duration being the dominant force in the relationship between job loss and suicide. Nevertheless, mass-layoffs may be powerful localized events where suicide risk increases shortly afterward. Implications for the design of unemployment insurance are discussed.

	abstract = {Background
Police kill more than 300 black Americans—at least a quarter of them unarmed—each year in the USA. These events might have spillover effects on the mental health of people not directly affected.
Methods
In this population-based, quasi-experimental study, we combined novel data on police killings with individual-level data from the nationally representative 2013–15 US Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) to estimate the causal impact of police killings of unarmed black Americans on self-reported mental health of other black American adults in the US general population. The primary exposure was the number of police killings of unarmed black Americans occurring in the 3 months prior to the BRFSS interview within the same state. The primary outcome was the number of days in the previous month in which the respondent's mental health was reported as “not good”. We estimated difference-in-differences regression models—adjusting for state-month, month-year, and interview-day fixed effects, as well as age, sex, and educational attainment. We additionally assessed the timing of effects, the specificity of the effects to black Americans, and the robustness of our findings.
Findings
38 993 (weighted sample share 49\%) of 103 710 black American respondents were exposed to one or more police killings of unarmed black Americans in their state of residence in the 3 months prior to the survey. Each additional police killing of an unarmed black American was associated with 0·14 additional poor mental health days (95\% CI 0·07–0·22; p=0·00047) among black American respondents. The largest effects on mental health occurred in the 1–2 months after exposure, with no significant effects estimated for respondents interviewed before police killings (falsification test). Mental health impacts were not observed among white respondents and resulted only from police killings of unarmed black Americans (not unarmed white Americans or armed black Americans).
Interpretation
Police killings of unarmed black Americans have adverse effects on mental health among black American adults in the general population.

Recent reviews of the literature indicate, however, that limited rigorous research exists examining the effect of imprisonment on the likelihood of future offending. As a result, scholars have called for assessment of this relationship, while using methodologies that can better account for selection effects. This study addresses these calls directly by applying regression discontinuity, a methodology well suited to account for selection bias, on a cohort of felony offenders in Florida. Results suggest that prison, as compared to non-incarcerative sanctions, has no appreciable impact on recidivism. Although no differential effects surfaced across race/ethnicity, the analyses indicated that imprisonment exerts a differential effect by gender with the effect being more criminogenic among males than females.},

We find little evidence that incarceration reduces the probability of recidivism, as would be expected based on "specific deterrence" and "incapacitation" hypotheses.},

We argue that population effects are more relevant due to a heavy reliance on custodial risk assessments which place high concentrations of the most dangerous offenders within particular facilities or units within facilities, rendering these environments less effective for controlling inmate misconduct regardless of tighter security and greater use of administrative controls relative to lower security environments. A partial test of our model was conducted with a national US sample of 247 state prisons for men and women. Results indicate that while both facility and population factors are relevant predictors of offense levels, population effects are stronger and more prevalent.

Inmate rule violations or “misconducts” reflect offending within a prison, and this study involved a systematic review of studies of the causes/correlates of inmate misconduct published between 1980 and 2013.
Methods
An exhaustive search of relevant high impact journals yielded 98 studies of causes/correlates of inmates misconduct published between 1980 and 2013. The final models from these studies were examined to assess the impact of the predictor variables on misconduct.
Results
Findings revealed that predictor variables reflecting inmates’ background characteristics (e.g., age, prior record), their institutional routines and experiences (e.g., prior misconducts), and prison characteristics (e.g., security level) all impact misconduct.
Conclusions
Researchers should apply general theories of crime and deviance (e.g., control) that can incorporate all of the empirically relevant inmate and prison characteristics to the study of offending in prison (misconduct). Researchers should also examine the sources of variability in the effects of predictor variables across studies.},

	shorttitle = {Do {Prisons} {Make} {Us} {Safer}?},
	abstract = {The number of people incarcerated in U.S. prisons and jails more than quadrupled between 1975 and 2005, reaching the unprecedented level of over two million inmates today. Annual corrections spending now exceeds 64 billion dollars, and many of the social and economic burdens resulting from mass incarceration fall disproportionately on minority communities. Yet crime rates across the country have also dropped considerably during this time period. In Do Prisons Make Us Safer? leading experts systematically examine the complex repercussions of the massive surge in our nation's prison system. Do Prisons Make Us Safer? asks whether it makes sense to maintain such a large and costly prison system. The contributors expand the scope of previous analyses to include a number of underexplored dimensions, such as the fiscal impact on states, effects on children, and employment prospects for former inmates. Steven Raphael and Michael Stoll assess the reasons behind the explosion in incarceration rates and find that criminal behavior itself accounts for only a small fraction of the prison boom. Eighty-five percent of the trend can be attributed to "get tough on crime" policies that have increased both the likelihood of a prison sentence and the length of time served. Shawn Bushway shows that while prison time effectively deters and incapacitates criminals in the short term, long-term benefits such as overall crime reduction or individual rehabilitation are less clear cut. Amy Lerman conducts a novel investigation into the effects of imprisonment on criminal psychology and uncovers striking evidence that placement in a high security penitentiary leads to increased rates of violence and anger—particularly in the case of first time or minor offenders. Rucker Johnson documents the spill-over effects of parental incarceration—children who have had a parent serve prison time exhibit more behavioral problems than their peers. Policies to enhance the well-being of these children are essential to breaking a devastating cycle of poverty, unemployment, and crime. John Donohue's economic calculations suggest that alternative social welfare policies such as education and employment programs for at-risk youth may lower crime just as effectively as prisons, but at a much lower human cost. The cost of hiring a new teacher is roughly equal to the cost of incarcerating an additional inmate. The United States currently imprisons a greater proportion of its citizens than any other nation in the world. Until now, however, we've lacked systematic and comprehensive data on how this prison boom has affected families, communities, and our nation as a whole. Do Prisons Make Us Safer? provides a highly nuanced and deeply engaging account of one of the most dramatic policy developments in recent U.S. history.},

Our estimation strategy takes advantage of the natural experiment created by recent expansions in the female penal system. The physical expansion of the penal system decreased the distance to prisons for some cities while increasing it for others. Our results suggest that incarceration location has a sizable deterrence effect. Increasing the average distance to a woman's prison by 40 miles reduces the female violent crime rate by approximately 6\%.},

We find significant increases in the frequency and intensity of alcohol consumption combined with a significant decrease in moderate physical activities as a response to partner's retirement. In line with the existing literature, we find that own retirement has significant positive effects on engaging in moderate and vigorous physical activities but also leads to a significant increase in the frequency of alcohol intake. Overall, subjective health is negatively affected by spousal retirement and positively by own retirement.},

	abstract = {Recent statistics indicate that 25 percent of all female college students will experience some form of sexual assault by the time they graduate. Even that figure is probably an underestimate, since many women who are assaulted drop out of school. Very few of these incidents are reported, and when they are, campus authorities often mishandle the case, causing further trauma to the victim. Of the small number of cases pursued through campus judicial procedures or reported to the police, only a fraction result in conviction. Why does no one seem to know what to do about the problem of sexual assault on campus? Why do so few women report their assault? Why are so many cases mishandled? Why do some college administrators so fear being sued that their fear becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy? Why are some institutions better equipped to handle the problem, and what is the best way to handle sexual assault on campus? Carol Bohmer and Andrea Parrot, both recognized experts on the problem of rape, particularly acquaintance rape, examine these and other questions in this landmark book. Sexual Assault on Campus combines social science evidence, analysis of legal doctrine and cases, and interviews with victims, their parents, campus security officers, and college administrators. Based on the results of their own qualitative study on the responses to complaints of sexual assault on campus, the authors offer important new guidance to all involved in the problem, particularly administrators, lawyers, and service providers working with students - from rape crisis centers and social workers to residence hall directors. Further, Sexual Assault on Campus includes case studies, making it important readingfor students of social work, criminology, and law and society programs. And certainly victims of campus rape, their families, and friends will want to read this book - the first ever to deal effectively with the aftermath of sexual assault on campus.},

My estimate shows that a 10 percentage point increase in Greek student composition translates to a 0.02 standard deviation increase in course grade for Greek students relative to non-Greek students. I further find that this effect is driven largely by low-achieving and middle-achieving white Greek members.},

	abstract = {Limited research has examined sexual victimization among U.S. college men, and particularly fraternity men. We report the prevalence of sexual assault (SA) victimization among a sample of college fraternity members and the sociodemographic variables associated with this victimization. In April 2018, we conducted a web-based survey study among a random sample of fraternity members (n = 102) from a list of all fraternity members at a large Midwestern university. We used Fisher’s exact tests, Student’s t-tests, and log-binomial regression models to assess associations between sociodemographic variables and any SA victimization (attempted or completed penetrative sexual assault). Over a quarter (27.5\%) of respondents reported experiencing any SA victimization—penetrative sexual assault (13.7\%) or attempted penetrative sexual assault (25.5\%)—since entering college. Age, school year, and being on a varsity sports team were significantly associated with any SA victimization (p-values: {\textless}.01, {\textless}.01, and .02, respectively). Regression analyses showed older fraternity men had experienced significantly greater prevalence of any SA victimization compared to younger fraternity men (prevalence ratio [PR]: 2.78, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.35–5.73). Furthermore, any SA victimization was also more common among varsity sports team members (3\%) compared to nonmembers (0\%). These findings indicate that college men, particularly fraternity members, may experience sexual assault victimization at high rates. Our more inclusive survey language may have captured sexually violent experiences that traditional measures have not, such as “made to penetrate” experiences. We encourage the use of queries that are sensitive to the specific characteristics of male sexual violence victimization, including experiences of nonconsensual sexual activity where the victim is either the penetrated or the penetrator. Furthermore, prevention efforts and supportive services for survivors should be expanded to better address male SA victimization on college campuses.},

Alcohol-related behavior does not explain much of the effects of fraternity membership on either the human capital or social capital effects.

Methods: The survey included measures of attitudes towards sexual violence, knowledge of IPV resources, and participation in IPV prevention activities. Results: Fraternity members with unofficial houses were more accepting of sexual violence than nonmembers, whereas fraternity members with official houses were exposed to more IPV prevention messages than nonmembers. Conclusions: Results highlight the importance of considering fraternity house status as a risk factor for sexual violence. Unofficial houses that are not regulated by the university may be particularly problematic for IPV.},

	volume = {69},
	doi = {10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2012.132},
	abstract = {Context Despite empirical links between sexual revictimization (ie, experiencing 2 or more sexual assaults) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), to our knowledge, no epidemiological studies document the prevalence of sexual revictimization and PTSD. Establishing estimates is essential to determine the scope, public health impact, and psychiatric sequelae of sexual revictimization.
Objective To estimate the prevalence of sexual revictimization and PTSD among 3 national female samples (adolescent, college, and adult household probability).
Design Surveys were used to collect data from the National Women's Study–Replication (2006; college) as well as household probability samples from the National Survey of Adolescents–Replication (2005) and the National Women's Study–Replication (2006; household probability).
Setting Households and college campuses across the United States.
Participants One thousand seven hundred sixty-three adolescent girls, 2000 college women, and 3001 household-residing adult women.
Main Outcome Measures Behaviorally specific questions assessed unwanted sexual acts occurring over the life span owing to the use of force, threat of force, or incapacitation via drug or alcohol use. Posttraumatic stress disorder was assessed with a module validated against the criterion standard Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV.
Results About 53\% of victimized adolescents, 50\% of victimized college women, and 58.8\% of victimized household-residing women reported sexual revictimization. Current PTSD was reported by 20\% of revictimized adolescents, 40\% of revictimized college women, and 27.2\% of revictimized household-residing women. Compared with nonvictims, odds of meeting past 6-month PTSD were 4.3 to 8.2 times higher for revictimized respondents and 2.4 to 3.5 times higher for single victims.
Conclusions Population prevalence estimates suggest that 769 000 adolescent girls, 625 000 college women, and 13.4 million women in US households reported sexual revictimization. Further, 154 000 sexually revictimized adolescents, 250 000 sexually revictimized college women, and 3.6 million sexually revictimized household women met criteria for past 6-month PTSD. Findings highlight the importance of screening for sexual revictimization and PTSD in pediatric, college, and primary care settings.},

Upsets are associated with the largest increases in the number of expected offenses.},

When the population size of an aggregate unit is small relativeto the offense rate, crime rates must be computed from a small number ofoffenses. Such data are ill-suited to least-squares analysis. Poisson-basedregression models of counts of offenses are preferable because they arebuilt on assumptions about error distributions that are consistent withthe nature of event counts. A simple elaboration transforms the Poissonmodel of offense counts to a model of per capita offense rates.

Unlike classical statistical tests, these tests require specification of only the mean-variance relationship under the alternative, rather than the complete distribution whose choice is usually arbitrary. The optimal regression-based test is easily computed as the t-test from an auxiliary regression. If a distribution under the alternative hypothesis is in fact specified and is in the Katz system of distributions or is Cox's local approximation to the Poisson, the score test for the Poisson distribution is equivalent to the optimal regression-based test.},

Methods: In 2016 we compared the rate of 2010–2013 youth (18–24 years) emergency department (ED) visits for injuries in Hospital Service Areas (HSA) with and without fraternities and sororities. ED visits were identified in the State Emergency Department Database (n=1,560 hospitals, 1,080 HSAs, 16 states). US Census Bureau and National Center for Education Statistics sources identified HSA population and campus (n=659) characteristics. A proprietary database identified campuses with fraternities and sororities (n=287). ED visits explicitly linked to fraternities and sororities in the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System–All Injury Program were used to identify injury causes for sub-group analysis. Results: HSAs serving campuses with fraternities and sororities had lower age 18–24 injury rates for all causes except firearm injuries (no difference). Conclusions: Fraternities and sororities were not associated with a higher injury rate at the population level among undergraduate-age youth. A major limitation is not being able to observe campus health services utilization.},

	abstract = {Background: Alcohol-related rape among university students is clearly a major concern. However, there have been no large-scale surveys of the prevalence of this offence among university students in the UK. The aim of the current paper is to investigate the prevalence and characteristics of alcohol-related rape among university students in seven universities in Wales.Methods: All universities in Wales were approached to take part in the research. Eight of the nine universities agreed to take part and seven universities emailed their students as planned. On the launch date, emails were sent by the universities to all students requesting that they take part in the survey. The email contained a link to a questionnaire covering a range of topics including: demographics, lifestyle factors, and substance misuse.Results: In total, 7,846 students submitted a questionnaire. Overall, just under six per cent of females reported being the victim of alcohol-related rape while at university compared with one per cent of males. Sexual orientation was significantly correlated with alcohol-related rape, with three per cent of heterosexuals reported being the victim of alcohol-related rape, compared with eight per cent of lesbians or gays. Students who drank alcohol frequently and those involved in binge drinking were also significantly more likely to report the offence.Conclusions: The government and universities should play a more direct role to ensure that actions are taken to deter, prevent, and treat the consequences of these largely unreported offences.},

Campus party culture has been shown to influence risk of other types of victimization, and there is reason to believe it may also influence drugging victimization. Using three behavioral indicators of participation in the campus party culture—binge drinking, Greek life membership, and first-year student status—this study estimates the main effect of each indicator, and their interaction, on undergraduates’ rates of drugging victimization. Estimating a generalized linear model using a large random sample (N = 6,931) from three universities, results show that each party culture variable and their three-way interaction significantly influenced students’ rate of drugging victimization. Sorority members who were first-year students and binge drank at least once in the past month had significantly higher rates of drugging victimization compared to all other groups of students.},

The current paper aimed to examine if barriers to disclosure may be more salient to sorority women. Participants: We examined differences in rates of hypothetical willingness to formally disclose (N = 693) and actual formal/informal disclosure (N = 584) as well as mental health as a function of Greek-life status among college women. Method: Two separate online surveys were administered (October, 2016; January, 2017), respectively. Results: Findings suggest no significant differences in rates of hypothetical or actual formal/informal disclosure as a function of Greek-life status; however, Greek-life members reported lower mental health. Conclusion: Findings from the current studies suggest that institutional factors (e.g., campus climate) may serve as a barrier to disclosure.

An analysis of the norms and dynamics of the social construction of fraternity brotherhood reveals the highly masculinist features of fraternity structure and process, including concern with a narrow, stereotypical conception of masculinity and heterosexuality; a preoccupation with loyalty, protection of the group, and secrecy; the use of alcohol as a weapon against women's sexual reluctance; the pervasiveness of violence and physical force; and an obsession with competition, superiority, and dominance. Interfraternity rivalry and competition-particularly over members, intramural sports, and women-encourage fraternity men's commodification of women. We conclude that fraternities will continue to violate women socially and sexually unless they change in fundamental ways.},

The present study applies identity theory to patterns of casual sex and dating at college, more predominantly known as hookup culture, to examine how the “partier” identity shapes drinking, partying, and hooking up. More specifically, we incorporate structural and perceptual control aspects of identity theory, expecting to find that commitment to, salience of, and endorsement of meanings associated with the “partier” identity will increase hookup likelihood. In doing so, we move beyond a public health discourse of hookup “risks” and frame this sexual behavior as a form of identity verification deeply embedded in social relationships and the self. We utilize two waves of data collected six months apart from 19- to 27-year-old college students at a large, southeastern public university (n = 197). Path analyses were conducted in which we control for characteristics typically associated with hookup culture, finding limited effects of demographic characteristics (e.g., race, drinking, and Greek life membership) on behavior. Instead, we largely find support for the proposed direct and indirect effects of identity theory’s concepts, collected at Wave 1, on hook up behaviors at Wave 2.},

	abstract = {This conceptual article examines how existing institutionalized sexism constructed within fraternity party structure is used as a mechanism for categorizing women on college campuses. While these social gatherings provide an opportunity for interaction and new relationships, the environment is often constructed in a manner that reinforces traditional gender roles and increases the overall risk of sexual assaults. For some females, the attainment of status and social acceptance appears to be more important than the risk involved with attendance. The descriptive model presented focuses on the categories of relationships and the risk associated with assimilating into the fraternity party culture.},

To investigate, we construct a dataset of scandals at the top 100 U.S. universities from 2001 to 2013. We find that scandals with significant media coverage substantially reduce applications. For example, a scandal covered in a long-form news article leads to a 10\% drop in applications the following year-roughly the same impact of dropping ten spots in prominent college rankings. This impact persists for 2 years. We find no impact on incoming student body competitiveness, yield, or alumni donations, and little effect on deterring future scandals. (JEL L82, I23, D83)},

Participants included 702 college students (447 men, 225 women) attending fraternity parties in Blacksburg, VA. Six fraternities were randomly assigned to a control or experimental group, and each of these fraternities hosted two parties. The three fraternities in the experimental group hosted a baseline party first and then hosted an intervention party at which those having a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level below 0.05 were entered in a \$100 cash lottery. The three fraternities in the control group hosted two control (non-intervention) parties. For the experimental fraternities, mean BAC levels were significantly lower at the intervention parties (M=0.079) than the baseline parties (M=0.098) and the percentage of partygoers with a BAC below 0.08 was significantly higher at intervention parties (40.1\%) than at baseline parties (30.6\%). This field study supports the efficacy of differential reinforcement in controlling student intoxication at party settings.},

Participants: The authors' Campus Sexual Assault Study obtained self-report data from a random sample of undergraduate women (N = 5,446). Methods: The authors collected data on sexual assault victimization by using a cross-sectional, Web-based survey, and they conducted analyses assessing the role of substance use. The authors also compared victimizations before and during college, and across years of study. Results: Findings indicate that almost 20\% of undergraduate women experienced some type of completed sexual assault since entering college. Most sexual assaults occurred after women voluntarily consumed alcohol, whereas few occurred after women had been given a drug without their knowledge or consent. Conclusions: The authors discuss implications for campus sexual assault prevention programs, including the need for integrated substance use and sexual victimization prevention programming.},

Of the 136 cases of sexual assault reported over the 10-year period, 8 (5.9\%) are coded as false allegations.

	doi = {10.2307/2288929},
	abstract = {Transformations that could be used to reduce the influence of extreme observations of dependent variables, which can assume either sign, on regression coefficient estimates are studied in this article. Two that seem reasonable on a priori grounds--the extended Box-Cox (BC) and the inverse hyperbolic sine (IHS)--are evaluated in detail. One feature is that the log-likelihood function for IHS is defined for zero values of the dependent variable, which is not true of BC. The double-length regression technique (Davidson and MacKinnon 1984) is used to perform hypothesis tests of one transformation against the other using Canadian data on household net worth. These tests support the use of IHS instead of BC for this data set. Empirical investigators in economics often work with a logged dependent variable (taking the natural logarithm of a data series is, of course, a special case of BC) to reduce the weight their particular estimation procedure might otherwise attach to extreme values of the dependent variable. Logging dependent and independent variables has the added attraction that slope coefficients may be interpreted as elasticities. In the event that the dependent variable assumes nonpositive values, some researchers (e.g., Diamond and Hausman 1984; King and Dicks-Mireaux 1982) have dropped the nonpositive values and others have added a constant so that each observation is positive. An alternative transformation, which is defined for any real number, is the IHS transformation, {\textless}tex-math{\textgreater}\${\textbackslash}operatorname\{sinh\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}(x) = {\textbackslash}log(x + (x{\textasciicircum}2 + 1){\textasciicircum}\{1/2\})\${\textless}/tex-math{\textgreater}. This was proposed in Johnson (1949) and is just as easy to employ as the BC transformation.},
