## The Raw Data Graph

Figure \ref{diff_average_offenses} shows the average difference in moratorium days vs. non moratorium days for each school. Toshio suggested maybe adding in a vertical line showing the effect that I have in each of these graphs, I'm not sure I necessarily want to do this, but it could be interesting. Thoughts on that?


```{r}
source(paste0(here::here("tables/matching_word_table.R")))
```


```{r top_categories}
kable(top_categories, booktabs = T, caption = "\\label{top_categories}The Top 30 Most Frequently Reported Incidents") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("scale_down", "HOLD_position")) %>%
  footnote(list("Numbers in parenthesis denote the frequency of offense in the data. These offenses represent the  30 most frequent crimes in each category after the pattern-matching algorithm is applied."),
               threeparttable = T) %>% 
  landscape()
```

```
