## The Raw Data Graph

Figure \ref{diff_average_offenses} shows the average difference in moratorium days vs. non moratorium days for each school. Toshio suggested maybe adding in a vertical line showing the effect that I have in each of these graphs, I'm not sure I necessarily want to do this, but it could be interesting. Thoughts on that?
